Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre, however, considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enact new laws as of 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has grown after the November 2010 elections, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities urged to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they were sponsoring bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters 18-29 years of age do not have the required photo identity card.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
It appears, however, that two out of three Spanish voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to record about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of those who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the white people who made up 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetos of the democratic governors.
The United States Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could have partially limited the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undeniably make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious objective to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: whether or not to take the test?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have misleading results, with false negative results or false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
How to hesitate even more for men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who had no screening.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that there is between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We'll suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we'll offer them treatment.
More and more, specific criteria are being established to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of it.
It is estimated that if everyone were to eat well and move enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This has a great impact on the health of people.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging: 10 years after the cessation of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
The impact and obesity also support the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a life protects against colon cancer," it is added.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
The charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamine supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family history.
"Passer un test de dépistage, ça ne donne pas le cancer."
The boson of Higgs decorated
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs's boson created a whole emem last summer, and for cause.
We believe that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let us still assume that this is the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem thin, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this low world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break that rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics are a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting of grosso modo in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists rank the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens named fermions, who sadly obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other are bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can well be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the melons, which we will not address here, and the "particle of force," by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the boson of Higgs would in some way be related.
These bosons, we must point out here, are not all as exotic bestioles as we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a little like a rock launched in a pond.
From this "disturbing" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons "force-bearing."
More stable field
The same applies to Higgs' boson, to this difference that it is another field, Higgs' field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
This field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, we need to reach very, very high energies, just as if it were a frozen pond that only a very big rock could rip the surface.
This is why we need an immense accelerator of particles like that of the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
It is not all the particles, nor all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold of himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those who do it have a mass, while others (like the photon, yours) do not have a mass.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to review any discrepancy between MS observations and predictions.
In fact, they are many who wish that we find it, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and close some of the holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
But we haven't found such deviations in the CERN so far.
Implications
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Alone-the-World are more difficult to predict, but we would be wrong to assume that there will be no such research.
Here: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories were in no way suspecting the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They had scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already told us the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -, at the beginning the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget."
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optics work.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and has won it the Nobel of Physics 2009.
It does not, of course, mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this essential area, however, much remains to be done.
The Devoir tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that roasted him had left him a two-year repulse.
"They gave me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-fig half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for that," he said.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Sticked in front of an appetite lunch, he agrees to let himself help himself eat, resigned.
Brave, he even gets to smile, talks to the strangers who are staring around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be healed from diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our life, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing at the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all cancer-related.
They have a life pronostic of up to three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer prodigits so-called" curative care. "
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated."
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life," she said, before she accepted that she was put in a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for a last visit of her son from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois, we prodigal, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, that we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When we die, we will agree to give brandy or Pepsi mouth care, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the close as much as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, the caregiver manager.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but are not like each other.
Along with an old 93-year-old man who savors his last family assembly in the courtyard, well calmed in his pillows, while one trinques in his honour, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer women under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to ease suffering when a patient has reached the end of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that feared a number of palliative care physicians the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed with high levels of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients are only asking to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are bogging on their patients until the last day, despite the worst pronostics.
Helene Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned a proven chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she said she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was over!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not accessing their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, which means sleeping the patient until the time of his or her death, either sporadic or permanent.
One can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Canadian Institutes of Health Research journalism grant.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a great "system," combining building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's curious how the system has been collapsed since we took the great means," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Member of Parliament in Quebec City and former Chief of Police in Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal was erupted in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the misversations associated with road work contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only in turn.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, the occult financing of parties and the corruption of public servants.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he points out, "the only Ministry of Transport would have spared $1 billion on contracts," some of them reframing their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, hoping that it can "demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
The more "Marteau Scouade" police officers who, since 2009, would have led the "sewer cartel" in Montreal to put the soft pedal on contract inflations...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having poached rehearsal bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers at the Montreal road and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary that reversed the money in Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sow all winds in the 2000's, giving more than 880,000 Canadian dollars (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially then to the liberals in power.
He also confessed to having organized a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts for which it had increased costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working in a rush.
Gilles Surprising, ex-engineer in public works, made it very detailed before the commission: in ten years, he received gift building companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he was inflating.
Other road officials have confessed to having their legs fat by inflating invoices from 30% to 40%, by fake extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget fuelling his cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elites to shoot the alarm ring.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she became insurgent in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resale... 1.6 million to proponents, in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% dirty money in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a thread to understand the system's operation, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to pin the flawers."
The process, she said, is "painful but positive."
We are cleaning the wound, but we would need a unique investigation unit in Montreal and a day before we could see the suspicious practices coming back.
Just like we're cleaning up.
Usually.
Jacques Duchesneau notes from his side that "civil servants stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "elected people who are aware of the stratagem," when they were not dipping in the magouille!
Estimating the 70% share of dirty money in the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironises: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but it will not change it, according to it: "As long as we do not strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive review of the system of public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; we can go to the bottom, with courage, to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story snatches the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look at their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players are here.
Every day, I make progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
In the day-to-day, these elements are pushing me to heal my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
It's all going very fast in the football.
But I'm not burning.
From my debut to the preformation centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He's got a lot of big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was then out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What look are you looking at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In League 1, Lyon took us as a leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chickens, in front of Porto, so that we can receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for a long time.
Today, it is not.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really have a lot to do with this title of champion.
Last season we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media are waiting too much for PSG?
It's normal that we are expecting a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us, it's sure it's a little frustrating.
We're wondering what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
We proved in the League of Champions that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City who has not been able, for two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, you were imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was overlooking our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally taken it away.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
So much better than we say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and that he is making a lot of goals.
He came for that, and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He has shown everywhere he's past that he is a great player, a world star.
In the band, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This leads others to heal their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very keen to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from grappling game time.
I saw things over there and I got out reinforced.
Today, I can make good games in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Bleus.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must now have exemplary behaviour.
What look are you looking at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Bleus?
He's got the results for him.
We're well placed in the class group for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Bleus to Brazil.
Is the good null (1-1) ripped out on October 16 in Spain a founding game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone's been fighting for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I never had a match like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current monetary trade, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol as BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs to pairs files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around about ten dollars (the courses are identified on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credits," used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both depositaries of the account book, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It calls for the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and whose winner, sort of an interim central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, that is to say to transform a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hacher" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (lots of zeros at first).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, which leaves the margin...
The challenge is also addressed at each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already had high and low.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a payment company in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse such gifts.
Others, like the WordPress blogs platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analysed the account book and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes very much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that thousands of users are available.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Sutrès).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without waiting for us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, like times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerances, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, will no longer be tolerated when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with amanderers thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and armoured convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outburst on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood as a result of struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a kind of release, a return to security.
The Afghan people have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants outdated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Ancient Moudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become weakened, grabbing from government land to land to be built for refugees back in Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US outsourcing contracts.
They have been depressed; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the United States: capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They confront the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as well as boys.
Work will have to be provided to those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are friands of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish slips that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and already well before.
No industry has been refurbished, no dam is rehabilitated, no significant irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take care of it.
Without energy to treat iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left my Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, will need to return to normal reporting.
The departure of the French fighting troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school of girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of co-ordinating aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which is a local labour force, has helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two billion euros in military expenditure?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often located at more than 2,000 metres of altitude.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be free from the insurgency of foreign groups, what farmers have said to me, small, well-controlled, civil aid should be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution in the Forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever before around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its whole.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given this Assembly two more months to complete his work.
It has been about two years since Egypt was relying on a provisional text, several times amended, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persevere in his "autocratic delight," continuing to "betray his word" and "pietinate the right."
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a way to end as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview at the American Time weekly.
As this use of a precipitated vote is due to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the appeal.
Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shattered the door, considering that they could not make their views stand.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added in the early morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
In fact, commentators have been amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, as some members of the committee feel that the pendule of the constituent was unsettled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law," is finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971.
The Salafist parties, for whom "Islamic law-making is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace" the principles "with" the rules, "which would have allowed for more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," said the liberals, who only see it as a communication blow.
For, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance of laws with Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worrying because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premices of a theocratia. "
The fears of the Liberals are also grasped by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system "temper Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used use religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic case law, ndlr].
And in the future the question might arise as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it. "
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the broad powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another point in dispute is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there is no article on the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was to speak on television last night, events are scheduled for this afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will scroll them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the world center and a brine sea are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The Promise Earth brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has taken five major reasons to return to Israel.
Go to love the holy places
Make yourself unavoidable: the shores of Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptized funds" will be affected by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he apaised the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was in this particular place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it's good in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the path of the Cross (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoire), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sépulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Peter of the Onction and the place of the tomb.
This is where the Christian centre of the world is, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified was grown.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people from different confessions leave small words with prayers that are then heard.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are on abrupted rocks from a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telepheric takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can drive you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes make a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to live on the mountain summit once.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
Can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very old manuscripts of Qumrain, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Judea Desert, as well as about 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: The Art Museum of Tel Aviv.
The main features of the impressionists and expressionists are Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths made up of milling visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesaree, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or memorial shops.
The entry is free of charge and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and penetrate in total darkness.
Stars are scintillating.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the country in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside stations are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 ° while the air temperature can reach 23 °.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe there all year round.
By the way, it is the world's most unique sea: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily holds the bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are of an overrealist beauty.
This is done with salty water, limon, curative sludge, and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also just relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of Antiquity.
According to the legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persee saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow allies that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you can cross young married people who come to make photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesareum, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the croisés.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesaree was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, you better prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily tradable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As far as urban transport is concerned, it is mainly the buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, composed of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the working week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a variety of lamb and beef-based dishes, coconut milk soups and desserts but also houmous, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, chickpea balls, falafels, fruit and vegetables.
There are no rerouting dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-nourished cats that travel high air.
We can see them in the evening sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These félins like the passing places and don't refuse to be taken over.
Car rental varies according to brand from $37 per 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to the Promise from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who has a language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While Members of Parliament and human rights activists polemise what the law on compulsory language test will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and states that every migrant worker will have to take a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule concerns only those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sector.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of law, must be validated.
His language knowledge in Russian will need to be validated in order to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Beneficiary, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Russian Language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have on many occasions already asked the question in the press: what will that give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the Migratory Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slave-to-work."
Many talk about the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will help to solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
There are problems for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross unhonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" in an overcrowded maisonnette where he and dozens of his like will turn for months without food and paper and will have to trimmer between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"We promise them one thing, and when they arrive, we cheat them, we take their passport, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirmed the Chief of Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't fight me, officer!
However, many nationals of Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia are confident that they do not only know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadjiks can afford to follow even if only fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people are going to make money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel down and down."
Human rights defenders, however, notice an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal review or work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 ruble miles.
And then we can get a fake recording quickly for just 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we have no registration, that is, extortion cases.
"They ask for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea," said journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Do it fast, don't lesin, and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration documents were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Government representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper cuts."
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to harness the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether they are the shots made during the marriages or the killing organized by the moscovite jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, who has made seven deaths.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a weapon licence from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the Head of the Duma Committee for Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "shaking the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various fire centres, require to abandon "this foolish hardening."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a legal and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, we can find any weapon in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking arms controls
The first is "the military trace," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and weapons stolen directly to law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go for sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often undergone explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were triggered in order to conceal the deficit," says the former member.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
"There are private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and run weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," said an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," the former member added.
Where did the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons present in the black market were found there "because of employees whose work is related to weapons," it is explained in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5 per cent are from "clandestine searches."
A seller and consultant from an armor who has asked to keep anonymity ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these experts in the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers are going to search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, for example a TT gun.
We give it to him by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He brings it to town and resale it for €900 by the unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be elucidated, they purchase control from illegal arms dealers," said the seller.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and buyer are generally found through knowledge.
I went to sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was getting me into a "corner" to walk.
The price of the gun, I was given it on site.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come too by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former member Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military remembers.
There's no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I'm not just buying, we're going with the forest salesman and we're setting up a target.
"I am allowed to shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon is working well, we are starting to negotiate," the expert describes.
A shop from her couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where we can buy weapons "for different uses."
To do this, we need no documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," we write in advertising on the "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their applications there and ask their questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without a permit, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and shovels people who want to buy combat weapons.
People ruin themselves on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military member
I have heard about this type of pattern: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take control.
The buyer shall make the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without a gun and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast a huge network of fake sites and shovels people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People ruin themselves on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia," he says.
One Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, the experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a gun" association, we can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was released from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia has decreased by 7 per cent and is 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs have decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow in scale or to be drunken quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the modest wages of basic workers at Walmart and in the fast-catering chains, the organizers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," at a time when a deferlating rain of balances taking millions of people down to America and sometimes triggering slaves.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, who employ 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of small and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets everything: from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid workers at Walmart do their races only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to criticism, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of its employees' low wages.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as a lack of elevators or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" events were asking for an increase in salary, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the base employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, it's an amount that he can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, that would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages to consumers' shoulders, each race in the store would return them to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12.39 more in one year than now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8: 00 a.m. in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5000 items on this period to the second.
His crates made 100 million transactions for "Black Friday."
The spokesperson for Dan Fogleman in an interview at the left site Huffington Post assured that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com 'operation among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next client!"
Protestations continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet located there) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonal's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-foods increase them over time, but on average, its core employees reach New York $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teens worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonal's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 am near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food casters and cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, or more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the early restoration sector.
The United States law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing the protesters of a trade union by means of brimades or dismissals.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main features is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree.
Other tumultuous events were held close to several other fast food chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonal's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonal's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you the work you have done honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support the early restoration employees so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorkais deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast-food sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people took part in it without counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult for the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
"For now, we only get to cheat on the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have used to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
At first, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the Director of the Interactive 3D Technology Group of the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the bare-hand air, by creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we try to widen the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained at the pixels on flat screen and sometimes at the tactile.
We want to look at five to ten years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the gesture order.
- What is the future for us, too?
- Although the Kinect has made physical interaction, many things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of our own, in the physical world, make it more tactical.
To do this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice order?
She's appreciated, but isn't she oversized?
It cannot be said that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others about its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this canvas?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c / s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
We must keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c / s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given the touch to sensors a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 µs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much it influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need this guy in my job, but I don't need to touch, to have more executives by the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect today has three "cameras," one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the thought signal.
And the third camera is actually an usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As long as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of the technologies of the increased reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitional" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are the ones you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no touch sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and the machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
She's recording the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on wrists that influence nerve finishing of fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to cheat on the brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space that it walks in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of racing carpets (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, it is only medium to cheat on the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to the citadins that are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors in the art scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather barbu man, all red clothed that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the connected parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring together crowds, whatever their place of exhibition.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersbourgeois dealers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the avant-garde pétersbourgeoise in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and put them in a good mood.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbaria and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had ripe enough for this difficult role of his existence, philosophy and bohemian image.
- Kirill, why are you running the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, all that is not gray gives rise to aggressivity and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you should be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Culture Palace where my work was.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were ununderstood.
I began to be friendly with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was home before the work to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohème pétersbourgeoise.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "Van Gogh's ear."
Chnour and his friends were singing easy-to-play-back songs in moulding maillots, they included Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the band began to live, it became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg was running a lot of programs before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education was at home that he received them.
Galeria "D137," Club "Griboïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as habitued.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city."
I was named "painter of the year," and then my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and acuity.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's afraid to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything collapses, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it's the habit that matters, we're interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him his hand, but we need to spit him to the trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguised.
Recently we have seen you in the role of Barbaria's organ player.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, lequoous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into flocks, bohemian supporters loved one thing, niais another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhhaïlov!
- They're people we threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and at the end of the day it is less management, money, all lost.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat on them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I was painting paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not all can work in culture.
Under the reign of good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that we had to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are today good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and let them go.
At present, it is the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art has difficulty pushing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Scholarship
Hang in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate heating or collision with a murderer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with terrians on board are going to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to make our species live as a beetle or on a rescue planet?
I think there's not much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were doing experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit were in no way different from Earth varieties.
Then we put insects on orbit, small reproducing drosophile flies.
In 1979, scalp eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo was developing in an appetizer.
We get a completely normal dusty out.
It's then that the problems start.
"The problem is related to the fact that the dug must find a support, it must put its legs on and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were acting in a disorderly way.
And after 10 hours, the newborn saw their instincts completely atropished.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after the end of the day.
"We have scratched their eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiences will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, we didn't find out anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet able to be carried out directly in space.
It's not a thin case.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the women's organization is what humanity has most precious.
Our rod flew away and no one on Earth could say if he would hold after a flight in space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight
"No one answered this question," Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts that have had nothing and give birth to a healthy descent after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparedness Centre: Compulsory stage of preparation for flight
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular outlets.
The water imitates the beetle.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for her to get used to water.
It's in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, only two weeks are going on.
"It's very little to forget," says the infant swimming instructor, Marina Aksenova.
In one word, if for the child who has just been born the apesantor is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, with a force of weight.
As the muscles of the belly, of the basin, are very quickly atrophized, the baby's thrust capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the delivery simulators.
Of course we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will get him out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
A baby can't be dressed like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a fully disabled child with disabilities," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Science.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time it will become reality, when the Terrians go to their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Financial Control Institution) said: "The control of the pseudo self-employed (in Czech" Švarc system ") failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Senior Financial Control Institution, said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what we lack," Kala said in his comment on the current situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of Petr Nečas to the "Švarc system."
The Prime Minister recently stated that ODS is not going to import entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect to demand compliance," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the House of Deputies, you referred to a Checo-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was a practical question about?
This is a parallel control we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation as well as a proper practice.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, we have seen very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality," however, according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote itself to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you in practice and what is the result for you?
Common control of this kind should just help us stop trying to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, where this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, this will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged by paperwork, that those who are looking for them will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly, also has a somewhat different board, but these two institutions are basically acting in a similar way.
The powers are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which is in line with government resources.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are under control at the level of the Länder 'accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country we consider a model is also facing a range of problems.
Otherwise, they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already felt?
As this amendment has recently entered into force, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we are doing post-post checks, we must count with a certain delay.
Our observations only concern, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have put up almost 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules are becoming more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (for example, the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) required controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the contract law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without any consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what's the way out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS will not import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent action by an authority to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing is going to happen.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing in our home.
The roads are in frozen places, but most remain practicable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-locked.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but by frozen and also snow-locked places.
Temperatures fell and oscillated between -5 ° C and -10 ° C, but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snow falls have stopped in the area and there is only a fine layer of snow in the plains.
The crest of the Metallic Mountains (Krušné hory), however, are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that due to fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The R6 fast track and the region's national roads are now practicable without difficulty.
However, vigilance is still needed, for example on some bridges whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still frozen snow remains on some of their sections and by places tassed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Roads and Motorways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohema are threatened by ice formation and that snow layers driven by traffic can be found on roads in mountainous areas and at altitude.
The road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in the areas of the Pardubice region at an altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-category roads.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly in the Giants Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Aigle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow driven by traffic is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In Eastern Bohema, time will now be dry, most often clear, with possible clouds.
It will have a weak wind and temperatures will generally range between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although there is a need to be more vigilant in each place and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, however, visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is evident from the information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost without difficulty, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and Tachov district.
The departmental and third-class lanes are wet, and in this case the cautioning against frozen sections is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less popular roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region must now count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" collar and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to the services in charge of the road, it fell over three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most footwear is practicable without difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk are snow remains.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the collar called "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer "said today to ČTK the head of the road maintenance services of the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in Jeseník district also visited the site during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are practicable without difficulty, in the Šternberk district, however, drivers should pay attention in the sections in forest areas with left-wet footwear.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the North Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero in the lowest altitude, and therefore the snow and ice are expected to remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohème, there are no problems on the contrary, and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear sky and freezing during the night.
From the main traffic axes, difficult conditions have also been reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow to reach the pavement.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these new alarmants, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group, The Tap Tap, we rather rigole about it and we think we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years already.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when the Maya calendar on Kiribati Island which is in the peaceful ocean will end, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, together with the public, to think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters also recorded an hymn against the end of the world which is called "End of the world cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we hear her also during these charitable concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be singed simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
The hymns will also be joined at some point in a fully unique live show of Czech television.
The words of this song have been written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds Jesus's main role in the clip, Xindl X also singing there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We are working with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, because we are organizing numerous concerts and charitable events...
We are working to have them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts be for against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and that we are working on at the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities of interest and fun.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we are trying to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
A number of music groups and interpreters will go on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there too we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it first.
We have five electric chair members whose gear must travel in a soup, of course we also trimmer a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they astonished me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, everything has happened without problems.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public opinion attitude towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do at home, we have rightly witnessed Moscow only in the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it an obvious fact to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being established to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
What do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements continue to depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a heavy disability move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back for a few years, what prompted you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Látrès a Angelovič said, we lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not wrong?
This is true, creating links with known singers and working actively to promote the group has helped us.
We have understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the bottom.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a certain way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts long.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to realize something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people arrive at home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, Látrès a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and leave, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of The Tap Tap "End of the World canceled" will be singed together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, it is the second member State of the former Eastern Block (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet an understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference by A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his leading-edge work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics."
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the cold listeners and years later Šternfeld closer that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award in France for his work "Introduction à l'astronautique."
Ledit Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that his name has been given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
From 1925 a draisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only known information about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with teachers Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the retained documents that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research has stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The purpose of these two projects was military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a question of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem newspaper, in which are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautical Federation (created in 1951), and by the fall, PTA became a regular member of it.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This 1800-metre rocket was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently an improved version was built, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, two-storey rocket flight tests RM-2 were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963 all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965 succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liter.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were subsequently built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
This decision has raised a strong discussion in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in practice that the different economic entities as well as national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with frightened financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a pressure on prices.
The following meaning should be put to this end: a producer is trying to import goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making more expensive" the price of the competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no social responsibility for the unemployment it engages, the social burden of the State must increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this profit race.
This situation is at such a point of public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which governments in different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital at home.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to compel its own population economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other by the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years, which cannot support them with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated for employees working as auxiliaries to the federal Parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States are undoubtedly creating a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital invests in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to be tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to question whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not direct, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to firms of law closely related to industry.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The whole power comes not from the people, as Western-type constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman empire in the time of Caesar and Pompea": "The state was long in disliquescence and the functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the unlawfully obtained favours, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The underneath and corruption were unlimited and the people were going to the elections with already sold voices... "..." The honest people were not looking for functions, it resulted once the state remained eight months without consuls... "'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we had to choose an energetic man..." It is true that Appianos had in the Pompea spirit, but it was César who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of the society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and defend the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, as in the past, a decadence without before elites, without any effort to make in-depth reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises that we are today witnesses to, and the crimes against humanity as we know from old and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international and internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms that will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able to" says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "let us not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her death bed in 1849.
As a result of the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing of its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who is guilty and who is the victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; in sum, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, have been born in this political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain," on the one who mainly benefit from the tensions that have already continued for over 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for the study, others come from my own understanding of that, or more precisely from the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At every time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities were acting independently or whether they had to do their actions on the throne to someone who led their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that has led to certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the snake (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first global press agency (Reuters) in order to end the link between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or carrying out wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to initiate a trial against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the 1859-71 years to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree freelance, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschild in their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Australian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war suddenly ended with German capitulation without economic and military justifications (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsar Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, bankers left the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed harsh war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions of a radicalization of the depleted masses (it was enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the perpetrators' finger, offering simple solutions) and on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia made up of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that had to play the role (that it actually held) of fifth column to put fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches of which will aspire to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the historic Judea region with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it was difficult to appreciate whether Hitler had broken the chains in which the international bankers had held it initially; or if all he had done was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a fire home that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are strongly divided between Israel's supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong causes another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where there is, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
Here we have to make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, international bankers only offer people in the elections their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascising politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of its accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait through which 20% of all world oil flows (this naval corridor has only a width of 2 miles) and generate a destruction of the world economy.
Under which light now appears the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new global order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it completely controlled.
"Let them force all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear on the hand or front a red iron mark, so that he cannot buy or sell him who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: let him who has common sense count the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number refers to man and it is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The Argo movie: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamist students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats in hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, which was further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States led to a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian debacle made a major contribution to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated perimeties, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tourning team who came to make markings for the filming of a large-scale film of science-fiction.
Gender combination
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper film," the story of a successful coup, of a traitor - for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances follow: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitles are presented iconic photographs of the times of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retranscribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes of CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his actor game ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark police officer "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that does not take place in his home city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywoodian standards.
Affleck also shows this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, when rebuilding real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, is written a history page.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false shooting team in Tehran's bazar).
Too many shares in too many places
The director had to be content with a subject that, in fact, offered only few picturesque scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is discarded by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing runway are quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, enjoying the retro design and style of the 1970s.
He leads the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the case.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public investigation into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop."
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies has been the source of our decision," said for the newspaper Právo the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdity mentioned are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women were at a disadvantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report to the end of the year any other so incredible idea of "the EU workshop."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations are, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has adverse environmental consequences, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chickens, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been expressed in the past against the de facto prohibition of using the term "tartiner butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have "abnormal curvature."
The European Commission argued that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation to last year's EU Regulation, which requires a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult surveillance.
The EU referred to an American survey that balloons are among toys the first cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age with regard to blowing into fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, any person with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let Do" association, bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdity mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey considered the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea makes us handicapped.
We will ask the European Union for a refund. "Thus, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for the granting of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), who were to be used in the preparation of applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Bad regulations are rare."
While the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its general development are commendable.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle that it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions among the Czech people.
While at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrian, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky," for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar products, may bear the name of rum.
The official list of registered EU products now includes world-known cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or the ham of Parme, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Pohořelice and Třeboredi ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and the hops of Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Hořice Cornets" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do we have the idea of coming to the presidential elections?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't stand to see how the country has been looted in the last 20 years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and I am independent, a member of no party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly started for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back in this way to those who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will go into the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would be in the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we pietinate all those who try to bring about change.
In addition to this is the press that breaks the reputation of people and confers freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
We have, for example, said about me that I support journalists or that I have been the advisor for Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You started the struggle for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond 20 million [CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I got a win-win.
The problem is politicism: when someone comes from the left or from the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorizing and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and to implement it.
You think you're a right or left man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are placing me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is we are going forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enlist when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of Parliament, you have only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you are going to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, be able to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to rebroadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
For example, take the election of the President by direct suffrage, it was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without ambages, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just put myself into politics and I'm trying to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run for Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the investigation journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied, but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of people did not vote, and what did so, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the institution.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Despite all this, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct suffrage of mayors and prefects in regions.
Do you intend to base your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is stressless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have 20 thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was banging with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You go to Aston Martin, you have a 60-million-worth heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I get indebted?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not very interesting.
I don't have to pay for this campaign in my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I will not run for any election.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were putting your activities in deaf?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Práva newspaper.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that real adventures are not just about imagination. To convince themselves, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the bottom side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, an informatician in a large neighbouring company, tells us, "Yes, he is indeed beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes voluntarily in one of these ringardes libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city with nothing attractive at the doors of Rotterdam, has a quite special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to general culture and reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small miniatures in painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realised that there was only one way to take over the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of daring sticks diagrams and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual flegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a casing on the face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcerted and stirring their shoulders, Maas, the fearful, emptied his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by militant arguments by a: "dear common!"
There she is, my proposal for Spijkenisse's book mountain, or as they say, Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million-euro mountain has gone out of the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and some mitoyan buildings and houses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the book mountain received the second "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this little dull bourgade, which until today had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a mairie with a daightening daider, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in his history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator brings you to the heart of the mass, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you scramble the building floor at the discovery of its topography.
The interior fully made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant reverberations speak unequivocally the language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public benches, dogs, and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books, and still books.
"Normally, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," said Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been adroitantly built: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment centre and the building's technical power plant.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and odorate.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want any unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee offers us an imprenable view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pots ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute above all to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in ecology," Trouborst confides.
The building temperature is geothermal.
Although the book mountain is below a glass bell, the sun only unveils the interior, even in the days of beautiful weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted from through to the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic informatician, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has made it possible to fill the vides of the library that were not yet completely gardened (now it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing on all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration. "
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose forbearance.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, but was not too critical to Israel.
At the time of the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen forbearance in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany experience difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
An external policy, as in France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans in practice?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and forbearance in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining element.
However, I would not give too much importance to it, because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a key element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing forbearance in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious that it was so in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will only be respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration has a secret understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot publicly defend its position.
I think the real differences of opinion are not so big that they always seem to be.
If you observe the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from outstripping enthusiasm about Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany having difficulties reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I think it doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will assume a locomotive role in the future and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks their independence more.
Is Germany playing an important role in the international arena, is Germany only trying to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulties in taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable to it and, for obvious reasons, it still has difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with very varied neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at this moment the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a brand officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys protection such as the company that bears its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not sure she'd get a win for it.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, counsel for the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in property violation in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my office.
The imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to record their marks.
So, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being lawfully copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a classor in which the recordings made at the Beijing Trademark Office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by taking over part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centres that sell almost only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: its mandants charge him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai," a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and legal costs are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove suspicious records from the trade mark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter may last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported on the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticised name had become a "market reality."
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant had no luck, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiary, because he would have been detrimental to his brand in China.
In this field, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany shipyard machine manufacturer, the same company that had just repurchased the Putzmeister concrete pump producer.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's buyer, used before a blue and white logo that recalled BMW's. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against the plagiaries of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing, however, admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have spent last year from a "situation of emergency in the course of work to a found normalcy."
For example, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Agir expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark filing, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time at the top of the classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle is much more expensive, as is illustrated by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiary.
Of course, the Germans have been able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"This is our fault, because the surnames cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the Munichois' objection.
Freudenberg has certainly been successful in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is to be put in place.
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial, and he believes in the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, challenging and cost us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The Archives Department has even had to review the actions of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even in vain proposed to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what we see for us," Wentzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to unleash to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure the operation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to place the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is about to be done."
Pattloch and advise German companies to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trade mark law, but rather to "record in China also everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Sing, Sing, Help
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland look forward to their coming.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First of all, the cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies' snacks and men's mopeds are looking for the rhythm by hitting the foot floor. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers grow slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they take away, envole and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years of age have come from the genetician in human medicine to man at home.
"Ome Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the "Voices for Africa" association.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros by less, we can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in zoulou "story contour" or "praise singer."
No one can speak the bantoue language in common in this region, but all can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people with disabilities
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some of them live in small straw or land huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the evils of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, yet a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of half infection.
More than 40 per cent of the population in Swaziland is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of 30.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis mainly saw many children in the street to whom it was not only missing parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is no point of view.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa," an association that has since been working almost professionally on Esitjeni's AIDS orphans.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial TSI include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorragy (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The lice of the pubis and the gale belong to the parasitic TSI.
What are the main groups involved?
Syphilis and blennorragy often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contact between men is the source of at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidosis (fungal), blennorragy and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
In addition, in Germany, human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the change in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, lower belly pain, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close bodily contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sex partners take regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected TSIs can be healed and late sequelae can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds that the chorists collect through their voices across Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-secure woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos are so called the old women in Zulu, the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has no one is greeted in a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two hackers. With the support of the American organization for health PSI, the association has organized a HIV test for many people.
This is not self-evident because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects sexuality."
It's rather curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These State-sanctioned morals, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, Annette Lennartz adds, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh. "
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and make songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many of the world's leading black continent still experience from apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition that it not only engenders good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear to some daunting border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their girls.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," people say there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometers of bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of those chorists who tap foot in the Bergheimer Straße rehearsal room, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the Mercury planet.
The ice layer could be up to 20 metres thick.
The American Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science."
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly plunged into the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres, up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, there is no link between water discovery and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
Discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Cérès.
Like Pluto, which orbit around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the more difficult pink points to identify are the "newborn" in the world's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5," a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopee, at 6.500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant flashlight of a dying star.
The beignet-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifide nebula, at 5,400 light years of the Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters," can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts the colors more in value.
On this infrared photo, Hélice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation of the Verseau.
His resemblances with a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photos makes it possible to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art
The photograph published by the European Australian Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the Sagittarian constellation, several thousands of light years away.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the gleant heart of the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomers photographed the premices of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentum: 400 million light years away from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush to one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname as "southern fire wheel."
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebula is at 1.400 light years and consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
The circle of black holes is 430 million light years away from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810."
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our lactated path.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the nebula of the Rosette, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light years of the Earth.
In this light-rays galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was made up largely of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also attached to the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") by making use of the computing power of his machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 planets candidates since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will in particular have the mission of finding light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orb around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is of an eventful romanticism.
Along with the many road rotations, the small bus cahote along woody hills, torrential rivers and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we'd almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about which we do not know much, except that they speak the Persian and the Azéri perfectly and have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small city plunges with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era, which is not at all in line with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one track.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the world's oldest people's festival," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the longevity museum, the only museum of this kind in the world.
It is possible to discover the lives of about eight dozens of Talysh in the region that are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Having another child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you think the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a Gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"surprisingly older people also live in some parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the inexistence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registration register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, in fact, that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the southern part of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calories-rich meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus.
It is sitting on the ground next to a baratte, of which it beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among them one of Mirzayeva's sons and a girl, who have long been adults.
Two little children are also playing in the house.
In the kitchen, you prepare tea for guests served in typical armadus belly-shaped glasses.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long tresses of a dark blond that his son reveals to us with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astonished in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the nation's paternal figure, a man who has yet led his country as a dictator, has almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham later succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euro) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And maybe the long-standing son of Mirzayeva is right: "Elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is back in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country's deep divide.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not in possession of words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also for the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the lay.
Because all the members of the opposition confuse and desperately disobedient are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocratia on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, holding a doctorate from the American University of South California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the majority Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night round of force are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and it always remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists would use the vague formulation and the resulting legal space to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all Sharia subjects, the al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its shade radiates over all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts worked to punish opponents.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The State must also, read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values."
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, it would be just censorship.
In addition, there is no specific article that specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the prophet Mahomet or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it must be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is prohibited to "offend people."
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a law man?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be "very soon" the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concorde on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to drop the sharia before it entered into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and send him back," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expelled," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its invalidity.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The voiled women and the supporters of the salafists, who participated in many, were scandalous: "The people call for the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Quran was their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, along with its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and strong.
In their view, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot of the leadership that the country must take.
The Islamists' project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have been extended until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are critical violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto removes all his powers," said Saeda.
Yet democracy cannot work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be paid.
A protester on Tharir Square warned: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most odorant fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the premises for an extremely odorant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty foot clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3: 00 in Oslo.
It snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this odour, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-sprayed trout and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the odour you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegian people gather together in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat believed, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also called "Rakfisk General," responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and bent a lot of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," said Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in watertight barrels in the air, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses of alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, although odorant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 €each.
Norway does not often make it talk about it in international news, which is not for it to regret.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegian people have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country one of them has been able to commit such an act of barbarity.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the unique reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, in the blonde hair and in the eyes of a transperding blue, the image of northern well-being, with a set of rakfisk by hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries threw the money through the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the ropes of its stock exchange tight.
"As long as you can skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Not to forget the rakfisk," she adds in a tireless laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm dick to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made up of momentum, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we use rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorant of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter is wearing a butterfly knot, surrounded by rashfisk plates.
We would look like the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"This is our dots, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of the abusing aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is having a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties ahead and the many expectations of the people.
The road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city where the congestion is legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task is waiting for him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that are due to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people lives in six years.
"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to American President Barack Obama in the Ovale Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentacular state that enforces the capital. On its predilection land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is included in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bosselated and full of shrimp.
Plates with its name are hanging outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We count on him to put in place lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticisms of the opponents who reproached the new President for lack of charism.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent state man and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the autobridges of the motorways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, military personnel were called to rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a sinistrate area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was a governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's detractors say that, at best, he failed to curb the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front of it.
In a concrete house, typical of this ruined neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beaten, and the cadavian rigidity was already initiated.
As his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old bogus, a trouble-maker, a weirdo.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Dozens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, member of the Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, said prosecutors.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to during the detention.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the ground that Manning's sequestration has been under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of robbing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the biggest leak of confidential information in the whole history of the American army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
In a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request that the Manning case be closed on the ground that the sequestration took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of robbing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that his guards reserved was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems raised.
"They wrote" no problem "(after having addressed the concerns), and however, it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special commission that had met to evoke the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a "risk of injury."
The military stated that they had assigned it this restrictive status -- one level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Corps des Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very alarming.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent the lightest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without a company.
Manning also added that the only objects at his disposal were mattresses, blankets, rods, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying elongated during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also stated that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was it allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deducted from the order of his guard that he should drop his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go of her.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or his tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty before a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty of the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public goods or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all indictments are held, he shall be liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the American-Mexico are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
There were two signs: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreign").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing what line I was heading for.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualificative, like the one my Boston friends use when they say "Irish," or my New York friends when they say "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land that saw my grandfather born, no need for special qualificative or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and went to the "Foreign" file.
I thought at that time of the week when new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
In general, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking in the United States.
He wished to join the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the point of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official US critics about Mexico, you are beginning to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are violating the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And Montezuma's children are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that that the country maintains with the more than 35 million Mexican-American people living in the United States.
You want us to look at the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our genealogy tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the American dream we are living, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We accord it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they rob us as if we were individuals of lower strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not be stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who has legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more strongly and Mexico-Americans are upset with it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexico-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as a fortune ambassador for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, if we consider the inequities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans always want them to do so in the way that their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another effusion of blood seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings have been dusty; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and for the first time rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be blocked in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab spring has made it all flowing, and whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will become even more intense.
Yet there are all the reasons to think that this could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first sight, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even if the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has been leading Gaza since 2007, will be tasked with forcing the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has wiped out a rush.
Having killed some of its leaders and refouled the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners on the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made itself rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken up and caused for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Golf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the growing Islamist is running around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hizbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where the Islamist-tendered rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brothers under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populated and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despote who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily relying on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
The "Iron Dome" missile interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the root of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza rocket fire has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that impiets the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicist party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman approaching the January 22 election, has the beautiful party.
Why do you sleep these damn Palestinian men by giving them a state?
If they were to run the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their head.
Perhaps the supporters of the line will take it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes it.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Commencing a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that is of good augure -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a spruce that is once intended to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic award.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for external people to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with field exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for a pseudo state in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
When he returned to the White House, he seemed equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very tricky vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This means an agreement for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different health pictures and warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's most stringent tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamour representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before age 26, 99% of the chances are that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess. "
While Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers stated that this would relinquish trade in the black market, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
The Chinese and Indonesian smugglers will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had stimulated their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the demand for cigarette studs, including silicone to mask horrible packagings, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Brittan's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the High Court of Australia.
Ha stated that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population target of the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the most important place for excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been having trouble making a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you cut the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a photo of the tumor of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I can stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the calibrations.
"I used to take an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all, and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we put the key under the door," he added, lifting arms in the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I have had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Pending half a day in an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some scholars and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
This force the brain to take interesting paths, even to feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome open-arm boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more time free.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Greek-Roman Professor of History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom goes a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffitis that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that he was defined and discussed in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After traveling through many publications and subjecting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that is "wanting to do something, but not able to engage in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates the boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although she would like it.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of trouble, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a maussade mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
Boredom can look very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, from the next room, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others have just heard the TV show, and the third group has not heard the sound band at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said they had more trouble than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to trouble.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, a disruption of attention can lead to trouble, "said Mark J. Fenske, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like watching objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not bother."
In fact, he said, now we know that when you tortille or claws, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and receive more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or another - the delay in my flight, a speaker with a monocorde voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
By using this scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, "said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of many and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blamed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a teacher in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted almost 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's percentages of trouble, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is trouble good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are referring to a link between boredom and creativity, "said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain found you to know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you look at TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-regulation, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation is moving from one situation to another," he says.
Your child is not just learning to entertain, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just like I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling of activities and technology is the objective to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to be bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stop times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana bolts and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each with a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without follow-up.
The police service has stopped inculcating adults aged 21 years and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to instil those who own them.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the West Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future is for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of the Aurora Police, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether or not we want it, is in advance of most of the regulatory states for marijuana, first with respect to therapeutic use and now with respect to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or a crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons 21 years of age and over who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop inculcating people for this type of "immediate effect" offence.
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to pressure users to be detoxified.
At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the county public prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to file all cases of marijuana detention without further action.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework appropriate to the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and is speaking as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so, they have difficulty accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first state to treat the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington are now becoming a case of case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and government representatives are planning a new legalized sales border, they look forward to the federal government's directives, which still conceive marijuana sales and culture as federal crimes.
The advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite some mediatised arrests of patients with therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales shops for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to shake the doors to seize small drug bags, there is a lot to bet that it is opposed to registered sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, "said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Much before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums concerning the creation of new marijuana sales shops, even if it is only a one-year deferral.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the State.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misled and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I always dreamed to go to Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother have studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to do my suitcases, provoking the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with facetity that I was gone after being forced to drink in anchored cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidations and was the subject of constant brimades.
Not because my name was rather outdated, or because I was from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was a victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I was partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why are you talking about this today?
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students from the centre-right is suffering the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative members of the student room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want to have a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, Intelligent and Right"), devoted to politics among students, which depicted "Tories" as eccentric and neonazis.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who is moving in Rolls-Royce, has a complete silver and is moving with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats of the introduction of the increase in tuition fees. "
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said to a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing left-hand party in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, OUCA president, said that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are central-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18 years old and of paralytic timidity.
The hate of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students met others and teachers, I had a foretaste of what was going to happen later.
I found out that teachers not only took part in sarcasms towards Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy about minor strikers, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in classroom wood.
The first sarcasm that I was a victim of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a pustulous little man in his face, was easy to take.
"Do the Thatcheristers refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy making friends," he launched with a harsh tone.
I went back to my room, unconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid that's how it is.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory young people claim to be Labour (workers).
Later at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This stratagem has failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironially, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pork."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the stool.
I was perverted, you slut.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history teacher, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was an external policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its Marxist-determinist adherence to history.
In 1997 he accepted a position of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he told me pathologically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bouncers.
Even my communist friends had unforgettable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Fatigued by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, sucked to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inside of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brain washing and called them "old fools."
The repulse was short-term.
It was my father who dragged the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my suitors gave up.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a crurnichard wet hay.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture," inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couturier clients.
Somerset House, the former residence of Élisabeth Ire d'Angleterre, is the only place of the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture," a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high sewing models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "he signs" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and other than nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette megots on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of beauties of time like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the charism of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Espagne, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass from fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobility line parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves well-raised people with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the Somerset House galleries was transformed into a 60-metre wide glamour podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream bearing the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of mannequins are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsbourg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he had made to me," said Naty Abascal, one of the couturier's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimes our beauty," added Feria's ex-duchess.
I like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and model Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red night dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a drop-off.
"It was a dream that became reality," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat that shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg retains the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, she is also the whole of the memories she is driving."
The "king" of fashion
The great final of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress carried during his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seams) to make this silk dress ivory with pearls incrustations, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half-metre traitor.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historic fact of the high sewing of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
Innubilated for years by the "know-how" of nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any of his clients' spouses.
"His refinement, his calm, his heartfelt and perfect look have always jumped in my eyes," Arenberg recognizes.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers are at risk of life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through spanked stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by carrying the sulphur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas from the insides of the earth solidifies at contact with air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of almost 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the spanked trails.
There are only 250 metres to the volcano's head that grows at 2.386 metres of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to gravel this distance, at a tortoise look, keeping the balance and measuring their steps to not drain and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fake step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a mortal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he spreads a way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and harshly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little down at 1,850 metres altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 centimes of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at Rs 10,000 (83 cents), since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to blanch sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips per day.
Each one takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," said the bearer who once worked as a maçon on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned close to her family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as the sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Ijen Kawah, but the sulphur has already started to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and carries special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
This young friendly and intelligent person could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood mask with other bearers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur does not stop wailing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by enlightening with a small lamp attached to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 bearers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment for carriers who work on their behalf and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of surge per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Able to wear up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can," because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur damage the throat and irrite the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains about serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and he extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," said Unainik, opening his mouth well, unveiling several missing teeth.
The elder of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult trades in the world: the human mules of the Kawah Ijen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapore is responsible for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfil our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unbelievable that these words come from an ad for mint pastilles, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a powder drain on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polichack in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people fulfilled "their national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in that country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a theme that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like throwing perfume to pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends US $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A Government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have helped to increase the number of single women and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that abound a little disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of derailing wages downwards and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has had its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unintended consequences
While the drop in birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box," which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage proponents who wish to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the EL Developers real estate company, says its "shoes" are selling much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more cost-effective for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to proponents who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too much small housing in a project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a state city.
If so much is that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with the Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people are giving it back later," said a young setting.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to be able to have my money and time," says another 20 years old.
Men and women mention their careers, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons to prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the private life domain that we can protect from intrusion."
What is in the private domain for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by disseminating events on the Internet that he would certainly not share off-line?
The elPeriódico newspaper interviewed five young boys, between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" with "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I will not unveil my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice images or games.
I'm talking to my friends, too.
"I will not share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy recognizes that it is difficult to publish obscure photos, people with nowhere, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, quickly," he said.
He states that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him either.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just remove them from my account," he recognizes.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharassment are not foreign to the young boy.
A close one of my friends was racketted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close her account.
"He only passed it into a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would put pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I were angry or pissed.
"Even if I know it's cyberharassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, Professor of English and Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that the academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natives et immigrants numériques," uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
It adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what or not to disclose, publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it is useless," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do off-line.
These are the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university teacher, primary teacher and education advisor, said that it was essential for parents to read conscientiously the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a strong foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we should not talk to strangers.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit closed, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information that was circulating between journalists was that given by press officers of some of the Unasur governments who were attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more important information.
Later, the Peru Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech rather than the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Arab-South America Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had not circulated the declaration called also Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which sets a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago and which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are holding today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversy, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera by giving a handshake to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that International Tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously mistaken.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the disappointment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was asked to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits."
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to maintain a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the cross-border axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were related to a larger connection with Ecuador, although he had not given further details.
The outcome document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will allow it to be reintegrated into the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional appointment, that he was hoping to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through a CIJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which will ask for a discussion with that country," he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the accession of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Block Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru is the pro-temporal chair of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take example on Europe."
President Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had met in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the countries members of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andine Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past" he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the replenishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxons States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South American, all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system which required him to submit himself to an interrogation in his territory concerning an alleged sexual offence while "Swedish legislation allows for this to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do free-air exercises.
"It acts on the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of an outlet that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and he points out that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the resolute of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings in various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant the free drive tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully allowed by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London, or asked him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that detrimental to freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed that it was not such journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the way and track the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the vet on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised attempts to coup," because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not being respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole to override them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficial for Latin America to refer to international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to bridging a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost his primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when the result of the test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid him from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to learn about him and his daunting was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is no doubt one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was without a voice."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV unit Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it is his reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV / AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of use of the immune system in patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," said the scientist interviewed.
In order to place this progress in its context, we must know that the life expectancy of the Mexican people is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to UNAIDS's annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients who have been identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least we have never missed any medicines, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine in ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnostics and, to this end, to offer massive screening tests, to all those who ask for it."
The specialists and members of the Jalisco State AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was already a supporter of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I die, it's better that I break up three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know he's suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they have to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many ditches between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, that's very good, but it results, that still today some have no access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?," asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, assures the journalist.
It proposes reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only sold at desks, but are found in public washrooms distributors and in places where young people attend.
It is not a question of encouraging solidarity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is to provide condoms to those who are already sexually active," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth State in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination is sexual, 6% blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who are not aware of it.
A decision ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It is therefore apparent that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country at the stoneware banner, in contravention of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the appeal made to the judgment of Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the northern district of Texas on 15 June last leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to refer to the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the court of the case points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the fifth circuit appeal court, serving in New Orleans, states that the main procedure is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been established to that end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, which was recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts made by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Faillites.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the United States courts, that is, the "vautour" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had encountered since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting costs to the country.
For now, the family society González Sada will appeal to the same Court of Appeal for the full vote, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The action for insurance will demand non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that it was free from the conventions signed by both countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they rob Vitro and rob the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globe trotter of the basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, manager and head of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I carried several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation during the 1990s," remembers Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remember his unstandard itinerary, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he is most affectionate are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
"It was my best years, the years I enjoyed most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967 onwards, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has been a lot of satisfaction for many years, including the five championships disputed from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrew at the 1981 championship, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team, "says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a costaud player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it? "
That's how Mincy started, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He welcomed the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's responsibilities in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play the last game, "said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you saw?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the PanAmerican Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and put a rocket on the United States team, which was quite similar to that that that had won bronze at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that might not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the imbroglio of the PanAmerican Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all pronostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, it's about Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín did.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Avoir is part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certification and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I take advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, was known globally by John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he was an unscrupulous, redundant and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a family release sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his dear home city of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of her wife in the original series and in the aftermath, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press attaché, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living life," Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis at Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a liver malignant tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this one he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles at the cinema are roles well received by the critics in "Le groupe," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was thanks to his magistral interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The CBS series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
It was J.R. 's sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had put her pregnant and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with charismatic smile: an unhonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to intercept his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-gît l'honnête citoyen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "huge man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is being made, informed the chain.
For now, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain have provided information on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the celebrity with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the California city of Malibu, where reside many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoranda "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life'.
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect it in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come to operate and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's gonna be fine."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombis, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religious professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hameçon: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax gulf that some have nicknamed "the Armageddon of the debt" and an increasing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé this week to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling, it was a very good period.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker delivers the "Media, Culture and End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombis, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We are analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The end of the world."
"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world did not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster," students must study, create projects and pass their final examinations.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of Revelation, which does not leave students any choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
The courses have been quite popular.
"He was completed in two hours," said Restall about his high-level student course, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I feel like seeing what people are able to do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religious and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have watched all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, told us to believe at the December 21 end of the world.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie zegle, last-year student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayan have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I confess that there is an anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
This is the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious teacher at La Salle University who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were giving courses here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he said, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many alleged dates of last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start immediately to think about the next date" or philosopher about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
