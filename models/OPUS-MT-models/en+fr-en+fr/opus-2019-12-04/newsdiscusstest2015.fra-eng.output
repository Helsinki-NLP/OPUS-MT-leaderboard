The UKIP remains who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks her if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them by an homophobia barely veiled.
Every time I or my family need NHS, we have to dick behind those intolerants to chronic hypocondria who think that everything is due to them.
I think you're using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing cinglés, does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specific argument is.
You also don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by charges of homophobia.
Farage's sentence has been very surprised, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobe remark.
You're gonna have to be able to get over it.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
We are so rarely talking about it because unlike Farage and his crazy disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as ruined in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that happens the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Widening almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's "TIGRE OF EUROPE" was sold to us a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
This is again to read the article.
We are trying to make sure that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, impots on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients no "pavoiser" for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twenty-first century, the irlaunch was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new country, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front of it.
That their development has not been a long, quiet river, it is on account of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of tax policies really paid by multinationals.
If we believe that a report was released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become huge again, and there are new cars (and cherry) with all the street corners, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is obvious in the daily caps since the return.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon flush.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a cling on the A140.
Will Ryanair now transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the elders will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once rush.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers a surcharge for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you could not afford to leave on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves to joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair against those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate have only to take care of themselves, etc.
It's quite transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and if passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
The passengers were placed in another aircraft in less than an hour, they are not entitled to compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: The Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally brings together people.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Bllancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that all stores are open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With a lot of strangers who spend...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, with 50% tourists.
@ aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is hampered by the fact that they buy in hobby.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, can lower prices.
Dominical rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy nor the Minister responsible for foreign affairs have any competence to reform the labour code.
As they close it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he has defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life that he has defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, to use to pay for the estate expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
Probably his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists / Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add his well-known hatred to the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940, he held up with the other government aristos who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis, and he wins very daunting.
Thanks to his beautiful rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell paints on the free market to collect money from succession costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they can collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure sites being by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true French evil: s distrust in dialogue
Back to the princeps.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come in solidarity with him or he has LAIT in exchange for his services or has made a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and one who lives from his annuities.
A good to rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of Finance sincerely lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less rude, then the need for investment is critic: insulation, refurbishment of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high income and annuities.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's profits are hurted by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction mid-September by Apple ™ of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and primitive price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and must be encouraged.
This is in our interest to all of us.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpborder friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on parisian bobos) could tell us what the author if they fight ideas about the genre and tell us the books they just intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart and cultivated person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evocating Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his life of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom," since you refer it back, this subject is not of interest to me, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backlog, because I am slow but I understand...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic tranch of throat.
We can see how much these studies touch the most intimate in their home.
We are clearly no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, Jean, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to sources.
Pretaining to fight ideas from the only presentation that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But good, as I explained to our umpborder friend is the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure by the way it's understood the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic slicer of throat, I was content with the "Second sex" (more than my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to the wishes of Lo.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a bit for the disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really lock the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash of blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
It's obsessed with you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne, so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also been able to cover up throughout the week of the Perseides meteor rain and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUICONQUE looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he ends up (necessarily) disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Sounds like Mars is going to collision with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Go to see today Tuesday 15 October the results of miracles recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation in the order of €8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
Quid in case of an error by the Ministry of Economy?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit of the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage when submitting the invoice to the state budget?
The next one in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@ lol No State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments in future growth and thus future revenues.
A few elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrat's sacred oath: the health of the profits of world pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to be happy with the incult masses.
By the way, doctors don't earn money with the drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
The doctors don't earn money with the drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world, doctors are courtesy in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It was perhaps misformulated to put the fault on the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and "research."
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices of drugs in all parts of the world, as well as differences between countries on what is available for free sale or only on prescription.
This is being strengthened by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, either direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that freer them and the expensive permits needed.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who reach a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in a hospital manager's ear.
We can't get patents on the grass...
If social science "researchers" did research rather than policy and networking, "work" could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Compare is not looking.
Compare is making pedagogy not research.
It is not possible to say "research is done it must be applied" and then in the same jet "it must be experimented with everything goes."
If your research is done why experiment?
If your research is not fooled why are you asking for them to be applied?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduct that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on condition that they learn how to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
Pisa tests are only an indicator that makes it possible for us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is it used to build an indicator that informs you of what arranges you, a self-promotion will, a deception?
One way to train teachers: to move sophists and ideologists away from training and that practitioners teach to practitioners.
Fabriice reread the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow to advance the system."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to have been operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, who never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education, it would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally foolish: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the tas.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member of Parliament responsible for combating copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thanks.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright violation = vol.
It's the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not at all the same.
By using content without having the right license, you deprive artists of their winners.
You can always discuss pathetic assumptions - but it's robbery.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property at the site under the general conditions they have passed from one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 balader with a boyfriend in the school bus, they should be deported for violating the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export that resource we are reverting, the grudge who says that everything is going wrong...
If it's a PS member who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What tires France downwards are speeches like yours.
@ gus I've been working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE of working in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red boulets on the null patterns that I frequently meet.
At ease in my sneakers I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the horrible truth!
@ gus, if one compares with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What do French business owners expect to do so?
May the state hold their hand?
This state they accuse of imperiality?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remember, what have you created as a job, as a value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are moving and mindful while waiting for the state's permanent assistant!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours / week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their suppression!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up, rather than change.
It doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, alas.
I tried to have them lately, but I didn't succeed.
But well, the Labour is going to get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral business and taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatised services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this so that the decision is finally cancelled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they have been telling us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and thinks that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
It may be because Dutch management is on good rails while British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with the fact of surviving a disease: "beating" cancer, who are no less dead, I know palanques.
To get out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's do it again, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to freeze, I'm telling you it's just...
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When there are examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that you can have merit to get out of a disease or that you can disdeserve not to get out of it, is simply monstruous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves, from everywhere, despite will, despite confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid moral is likely to make it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatment as this woman has done, not to refuse it for fear.
Someone who is beating in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine..
But if we prefer to rely on the "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you grab a dirt, a real one, you get ruined to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I grabbed two of them, bastards, big ones, and if I "fought" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to shake the teeth, to suffer hell, and to take the beats.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers for at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist has become nationalist who has triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way of doing so: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor rouleur.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign State which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was prestantly recognized by the Western States who then ended up lying about the situation on the ground.
The Serb population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyran (even if we did not like him).
To my knowledge there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece works about, by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
One hope therefore but the caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 years light from the Earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
A method to be followed.
Just like those who involve animals that feel a threat to happen.
Thank you, Science Passer, for regressing us, often, of these experimental prouesses that are made in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of a earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has priori odourless for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
We have no reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act in a strange way a few hours with a earthquake, including hens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report about the fight of two scientific teams, one from California, the other from Japan, to make the validity of their work that concerned the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular to their modification before a seism.
Well, of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions had convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should relearn to listen to nature...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious review, and no one contempt it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we face the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish was strangely round.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as a mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program you can't help thinking that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to make a diversion with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not hold one.
It only points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You."
Because it's a celebrity and people have been inculcated with the adoration of celebrities.
The Londonians voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crush the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what they said about the Londonians.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all who have given themselves the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent from B.)
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "scrap strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who stayed there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there by the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return to it.
We actually went in front of Savo Island, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is over.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total burst.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal decriminalize completely the concept..
Just go through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
One more com operation, neither done nor to do.
Cow, that's too much to do!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your recit makes me resurrect, by identifying myself a little by (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest rade!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of deplacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep getting us back, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!

Evening I think the red bonnet that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public organizations of all kinds should not devote a sou of our taxes to financing the dreams of a few adventurers even as friendly as they are!
Are there players in the current Serbian formation that are of Kusovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at the Juventus and now at the Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
It's Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle of the field or before in the 1970s and 1980s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in Velez's great team, who, under the guardianship of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful partner of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn * frisson *
Now, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as much as I know he's not there.
Maybe he's still doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there has not been too much disgrace (that I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to the neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapsing knowing that women, men and probably children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little bit in this "testimony" is that the only fact of having been able, even once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my view to a "border line" personality whose all "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Probably at the short time of "joy," we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do really and apocalyptically evil to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
It's grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims rooted by their sense of humiliation.
With filmed testimonies in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about it.
The Western "Christian / white / gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustation, anger, hatred of the musuman when it is detrimental to the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about Cairo or Algiers, not Dubai's towers.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this devil funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the conservatism bigot of the powers in place and the fascising nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of his critical expression.
That we understood it before, must not bring back the Muslims.
This is the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long, dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The fall is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut off in the fall.
Not as much to cut off as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grinchy pissing up some clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity from outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of eniving odours, with a fibrility that grows with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child increases, it is the amount received by the State that comes mainly from decimals 8 to 10.
However, in the case of the number of households having seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure, it is mainly the decimals 4 and 5 that are concerned (median income) according to Figure 2.
The abolition of half of the share concerning widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understands that it is indolore.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on the straw, but reviewers.
For once the PS makes a rather left-hand policy we're not gonna cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue this and you will encourage these 20% less to work or to leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Long live the Trots and the Recycled OIC at the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20 per cent of the population holds 80 per cent of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to eat as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is outdated, money is only used to make money, that is, to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these homes to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or even lower arms and live social minima, especially if you have social housing.
Fortunately, the utopies of the Red Khmer headers have lived.
I've made two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to come to the reception or face the slightest raids.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, sit behind and go back.
From now on it will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6: 00 too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made arrangements for it to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does this article cite Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a deposit and a month of rent at once, but I'm a little afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Support the troops," singed Bu $herie on all tones...
So, no offense, no offense.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of thousands of Kurds who died in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have sucked to something other than the chemical bombing of Saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is unproprietary (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if we "made them work 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
On time, our teachers are now winning more than engineers.
And we are not made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But it can't be seen because National Education has no means of providing an office to its teachers, so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay either the computer, the Internet connection or the supplies.
By the way, it's so high at 5: 00 a week and 4 months' vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with math, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't want to grab poorly educated bastards whose parents spit on you when you call yourself a jerk?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurd population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in London's sale to win nothing three times and yet it was a position for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I never regretted.
On this subject, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
How best to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the biscuit channels such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what is called the qualifications of unemployed people.
I have one of those degrees and I'm finished with production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article says, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we quickly rise the levels because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate has lasted for years as an engineer / artistic course.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisanny channels?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about the kind of media study diplomas or whatever the abscontic channel you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true channels.
We need people who can explain the great questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
It would not be better to be a real territorial policy to disengorb Paris and to energize the rest of France?
Personally, I can't see the inhabitants of the end-of-the-Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80km back every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belts already have many other more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and closed parks, as already exist in northern European cities in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidemment, it is hoped that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much to benefit from their big experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find room for UN SEUL bike clamping device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë...
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that are driving super fast and are bothering with the survival of bikes 2 / we take full pollution in the head For me the cycling tracks are peaks go, we need to reduce the car traffic (urban toll type of congestion), reduce the speed (Paris = 30), make the code of the road in verbalizing (even the bikes to the bikes to the bikes it is not to be made up to the bans, if we don't make the bikes to make the bikes to make the pads, if we do not make the bazes to the bazes to the bazes).
The cycling tracks are apartheid, we need to colive but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the great Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV's right.
The target of 15% velo replacements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rotated the green in the flour.
Moreover, after what OR reports, EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure how the world is changing.
Sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot before, Ukraine was launching air attacks on rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that the airlines pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpator government / Western Ukraine ultranationalists - and who want to demonstrate basically that Putin slaughtered the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is going on in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 decision of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this matter go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far the investigators have not said anything like that.
His name is Ricardo and being such an eco beotien is awful!
To be called Polaire is to lose the north is delighting.
A single question of Beotian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulament have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, merit and inheritance in the log term.
He shows that today's capital concentration joins that of the beginning of the 20 ° before 1914, he shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is right or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without reading the book, the main thing being to argue in a single sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I didn't read it, and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and this is the one that seems to me to be a pure fumistry.
The concept of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Aren't humanity all over the world enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the prize.
But remember she's only 17.
An age in which most people are just starting to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even not in the popular neighbourhoods of Great Britain!
Did someone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but said that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Is Malala itself not part of these "colourful pervers"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You are, yourself, a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't gonna marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father headed a school where girls were in school and he was in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, to receive higher education and to have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at age 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it in a sufficiently eloquent way for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a little difficulty finding his sosy character by Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best series of horror, one of the most abouted!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply overturning.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, outside of Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of scenes and mountaineers that lie in me.
We have an avalanche of original plans in AHS that ridiculises the aseptisation of today's productions.
It's a little out of my mind to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and above all her path and how she uses it) is really UN pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series piss by writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I can't see them doing ten seasons from American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours of time what.
But good everyone does what they want, huh?
It is by what I say "I will not look after" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut more into government spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to sabre in spending have failed.
Determining controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government expenditure in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that voters seem to call from their wishes and all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would use it properly.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines about useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes it very ridiculous to see the labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who wins £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc., and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (just over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car thumbnail, and it's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is levied at source before local taxes and car thumbnail.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend to believe that money falls out of heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of taxes spend.
How can a unemployed person looking for work at door-to-door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not be looking, that means that 80% are looking for and not finding.
As an unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances so much.
In fact, I haven't heard from Pole Emploi in months, that means that agents are more busy in control operations than actually making job announcements back?
I don't see any interest.
Because it's not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we have to get out of Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed do their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport title to the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been misestablished, and on one of the files, amputed by 40%, it was necessary to beat firm.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
The fichage and control are taking over at present, while statutory Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern the employees, they are the ones who pay for the coasts.
Non-employed French policies and policies grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is part of the development of wage-earners.
More than waiting for assassinated tweets in Arabic...
In fact, we must have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348 / 9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudeans had the spirit to prohibit the Hadj in Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the Mecca smallpox during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heart-free to propose to prevent Ebola's patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just common sense, but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put in strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health personnel can come in.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions."
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let us stop them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
May he pass the message of the first individual and of the second (including religious) group and he will have earned the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt that he is able to erect into dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the working planet.
He's still far from that design there.
For only 20 years, information has appeared as the given prime of humanity, while religion, which has been born from the brains, has been leading our actions since Lucy, perhaps.
What is the interest of becoming a Protestant Church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any case put their feet on the Church, only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@ louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will make it possible to touch more people...
@ Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you consider it preexisted in Christianity.
Hillel a century before he already said to him: "Do not do to others what you don't want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!."
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces agapê.
Your "advance justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
This is a return to communism?: -)
Next step: incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be prepared to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not invent.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The lapat-joy of the computer department blocks all the sympas sites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or does the £30 include the 20% discount?
However, the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Besides, I bought it from Steam, so no repayment, that's so bad.
It's time to buy a new video card * makes a big deal *
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that someday they would erase it from your library if they decided to act against people who buy it there while they are out of the planned area.

So, was France of 1940 a "putrid terreau"?
So say, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
You have to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel of Literature you wonder if Proust or Dostoievsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so selfish?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel of Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi, the awful ones.
Since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was bodelic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favourites.
I was delightfully surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving on the return Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's place to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance to start I was able to leave with several decent places.
I hope if I arrive at 95, I'll be as bright as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktails bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of lard on it.
I admire Mr.
Read Buddha and you will understand how much you are making a mistake, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you are a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it bans quêtes for jihâdists at the exit of the mosques.
She reports arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have big open eyes like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big closed eyes.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental countersense: all the representative authorities, organisations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned EI and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoch'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the Jewish French's approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of them a priori and to demand that they publicly protest to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only help to delight French society.
If there is no doubt, so do you.
Who does not say word consent, but consent to what?
Consent to a proximity to EI or to the conviction of EI.
Silence is practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unthinkable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "take revenge" of the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be silly.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they have no seats.
They can do what they want with all their electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to pay a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by SNP and UKIP who will cut their head in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death stop of his Scottish deputies.
No wonder some Members of Parliament Workers are asking their leaders for accounts.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, then they will be in very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important than that.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Targeting 8% pumps to the detriment of 85%, it is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish deputies are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists and it did him well.
However, he is still in a position to be Prime Minister in 2015, since he has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long term, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of her secret!
It's gay as a world.
Strong stimulus.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a mouchard.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's unsorry.
I am ahuri of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread ownership of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn * c, d * * itre,...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably disgusting.
For example, "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce.
@ Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing either readers or authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic children under acid.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not mine.; -)
Well seen: -P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless we win something there.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will return, so it is actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be an error to try to overthrow the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals or simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region. "
The reading of Indian Punchline is to be strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c * nneries swept by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in keeping in mind the previous realistic observations / warnings from Iran to offer from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are those "moderate" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the pervers of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines pushes the world towards abime and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existing "moderate" people pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we "need"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being still alive?
A little late for that, pal...
Aren't the criminals barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Jemaal killed just after the First World War by vengeance by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a poorer place in Central Asia about at the same time, when he went there dreaming of establishing a Turkish empire there.
What a disgusting thing!
An impressive control of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we are looking in vain for contact with the real.
All clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a mother carrying.
Lesbian couples may be simply a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile straight couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for this lady's retirement (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She's not from today.
Many women wore and put in the world children who were not of their husband.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is framed so that the "merchandisation" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics are not also merchandisation of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to get a good in a distant country via Internet and Pay Pal than to bear his responsibilities and to avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs!...
These practices were also not made in the name of the church!...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
However, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I only saw this from far away.
I had to go there all day because I had no right to go there at night!
But if you like it and listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many suspicious comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cools, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the culture of northern England.
There is nothing surprising about Paul Mason grabbing the social and political context, he understands things.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear there if you are in the London region in November: 99psoul will again pass from soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story," but here is a little article well written and well thought.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria / Exchange and down to Wallgate.
By gobbing pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginning of the Northern soul scene is described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which is held in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@ Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (moreover, that was also the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up angry and vocifered: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!. "
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not fuck the guard...
That it deplores the anti-Israelis, it is not the goal sought...
Antisionist: But I have answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report...
And it has always been so since the Policy was globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force relationship has allowed Israel to be created?
Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a strong relationship today!
Do you doubt that?!!!...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are only pseudo-chomskysts written no more.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which means it's a question of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horribly some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdity of the tabloids it actually gives the impression of being a starting populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted according to me.
The general consensus seems to be that he just says to people not to vote and rather to cross arms and to ignore all the political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles / videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich, at no time simply saying to ignore the politics because these parties do not govern in this way, it should be a lot more important to be able to be able to make a vote, rather than to be able to be able to make a vote for five years.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being active politically in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are sluggish people who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is rewarding to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tell the young people not to take the trouble of voting and just hope that everything will be better because it is really deforming his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people discussed what he really says rather than simply label him as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large amount of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote thing has been completely distorted.
The usefulness of slipping a bulletin into a ballot box every five years makes me deeply angry because my vote really does not matter for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members of Parliament who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "billevesées pseudo-chomskystes."
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, even with the headlines rajoutted to the assembly!
As Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but eventually became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It is based on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDV of History where trade historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have become depleted to the benefit of condensed loan-to-think type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a guilty, a scapegoat.
They develop both of the very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats that are the key to their thought.
I rather believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of reporting to each other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarching, neo-lib and / or / or libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek state aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organises itself.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the State: without that guilt she does not stand up.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Or support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old times, that of his god of then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too fast if you took Foucault's texts about the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel by this way...
Gauchet is a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard left-hand social sciences researchers who cannot stand that we go from allegiance to their mantras, is quite risky.
The narcisissm and authoritarianism of these people is unlimited.
One important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels," which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellow" that I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were friendly about me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently against whites.
My father is not happy that his elder daughter is going out with a white man.
I also believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and above all over the last few years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside large cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what has been said to me, Russians have mainly prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the shores of the Ienisseï River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of the Australians about the Chinese and the Aborigenes.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't support the Chinese, when I met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories, all people are worth it, and, in fact, those of London were very nice, that's the only reason I remember that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we meet, all people are worth, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here were talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with this white one.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Blanches would attack them PHYSIQUEMENT.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the union of the judiciary...
@ Marabout: Forgive me, but the judicial community is frankly a mark has the right.
When at the Judicial Union, he only represents 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer and that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It is then still the necessary tool of the law to refocus the assessment on fundamental issues.
The measure of its disrespect in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, forces a distinction between error and bias of judges.
It would be futile to pretend that acts of justice are not distributed between these three groups.
The claim and lack of knowledge are not part of an objective analysis.
And if this is not all analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
It is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it is far from low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The one of corruption * by the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance * which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area in question is that of the spoliation * of heirs committed to the procedure * by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains a year of 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage * provided by the quasi-impunity of the French notariat.
For their understanding of the mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is in line with that statistical improvement * moderated by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heir reluctant to be so spolied, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria then a developed form of lie?
It's probably totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to sneak the disabled.
It can be said that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to fit his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the open air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, the gouts and the colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIQUE.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog crack on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love tricycle all the way, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for the longboard.
Here there are hills that would like them.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see."
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, though.
Many of them have at their disposal reasonable insurance amounts.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know well that they are necessary to us.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, it is not planned to make it.
I am CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
The eight-year-old have lived all their lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
"Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit from their cement to the black market..."
Oh, that's not wood language, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for any person who has a heart and moral sense.
The US has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after he lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm an Western, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
Many are only looking for a one-night shot on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and trusting tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus circumventing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"To rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the verb "to let" in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% consistent with all the safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers the permission to practice a commercial activity there (what they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and have tried to see how to rent it (honestly) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that the boats can be moved, stolen and painted, cast, etc.?
The peniches are so slow that if someone tried to steal her she would always be close to where you left her.
Or hijacked by pirates...
all these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our peniches...
Where are you going to rob it?
No Marine The Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the truth that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to deplete!
High finance, speculate, plays with our businesses so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, with the care structures so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and our money that they hold..
All this in favour of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proof of the opposite, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economy of the Rothschild Bank, a story of better defending the interests of banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who was competent?
How do you call it: turn back his jacket, drop his pants?
Primary and populist response
In fact, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cuirassé in the area.
The sea was damp at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a quiet sea in the middle of the day.
In addition, the saviors knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that's not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search for Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two cuirassed cruises, who had disappeared in the black after having stopped the shooting, and a race-suit began.
The Leipzig lives something on fire, but by getting closer he saw it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the late battle and lived the Monmouth, penched and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlamps on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened the fire, finally sliding the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10: 15.
Inquiet of reports indicating a British cuirassé in the surrounding area, he set heading north. "
So, if that is true, the Germans, to try in the darkness before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had couled, and therefore could not seek survivors.
They also thought there was a larger cuirassé of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they diswaved to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should set a way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cut them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes stand before the UMP to request that it be registered in the law that an elected person who is finally convicted be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing elected people of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEE I PROPOSE AN INSCRIPTION IN THE MAGISTRATS CONS
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to amass those who will take advantage of their inremobility to hinder the actions of real policies, who are actually trying to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose impoverishment is to the extent of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little "subs for justice" signs they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even extreme right-wing trade unions were to target personalities on its side and led against them a legal-media war.
Your statements are completely free of charge.
If, at present, the right-wing is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
We have no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not had any favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the left-hand judicial union is not the only judicial union and is a minority.
That a minister support trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@ MCR The union you quote may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great to the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
There is now a question as to whether the "mission" of some judges is not more salute than instruction.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@ Pivoine: You forget that judges are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and to incarcerate all-one-each.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants never come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most starving devil of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directorates fill the stadiums of the world.
Others then sold a lot of discs or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars who don't take part in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, are able to make others.
In any case, most singers / groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more lucky to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar friars who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three agreements on a poem primary school level will probably become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even out an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied - a distance that turns rather quickly into racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us to these distant people as infinitely superstitious and banged by ritual bigotery, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to our own and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except that you are unwavering in the opposite sense.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is without a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières are not also a little sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
A very interesting article in any case.
It's an ephemere deco to fill the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Wonderful article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would give the orties not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of the disciplines so we can laugh a little bit?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modestie.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to rebuild history, understand societies, and here the example of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists used their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interlection of searches is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
There we are in the middle of (and old) controversy about the chamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "Les chamanes de la préhistoire," particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published at La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this very informative article
The heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we keep three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the caniveau?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, though, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc., at their risks and perils.
Rather than stinking up with those puerile ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then go away.
If these "puerile ass jokes" choke you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have released the safety because at the time another vehicle (for example, a dishwasher) was entering the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew he was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, well, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very british FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the English that then led...
You're getting out of this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have some time to unlock all your C * * * * * ries.
No, just no.
There have been lots of F1 conspiracy, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of a pilot's possibility of victory to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of safety because it's the FIA.
The size of the nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA above all to avoid the uncomfortable questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner shake a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag agitated, signs that the race can normally resume and is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark disconaissance of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag APRES the place of the accident, hence the green flag agitated.
It's the usual procedure.
The post of commisaries just downstream of the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 metres like 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell pilots to take back a normal look.
Sensationalism is selling advertising.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having a sexual life, pub and media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The news is exactly the same.
Making the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to continue scare people so we can continue to control them.
"When the tabloids touch about Ebola, we all catch the fear" It should be "derailent," not "tougher."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailler."
I wonder if all the people who are starving that Ebola could start to spread by air realise that they now believe in evolution?
You make them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antéchrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that joliously and securely ridiculates this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and angoissed (without reaching hysteria) for the government to get us out of the way when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we are to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any known cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still from this world almost 35 years later.
And at first it must have been awful, given the context of the 1980s-90's.
I'm bluffed, living with the certainty to spend it for years....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only do testimonies serve nothing: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@ traffic: testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be why people do not ask questions to psychiatric patients when they have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother's psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the evidence of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base the research on?
On fantasies?
You put on the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience" means the word "adulthood" by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think of themselves as great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@ Jim: There are full of useless buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik made us the "resilience."
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have made us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's not * not * a good idea to bring out the Sentinels of the air...
And why not?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out there are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can make miracles.
But how are they going to hang up with the kids?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the pipi-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is done well.: -)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6: 00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now go to 5: 30, Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't look at this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all Israeli searches under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The Mount of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
May be in Argentina??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its top, or Rocher's dome, sails in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For the Muslims, Mahomet went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac there.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is not propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and unfortunately they are relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and saddened it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish joke: "God be rented!"
To vanquish tourism in Israel, we are often seen by young naiads half-vest, alanguies on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a beautiful propaganda work!
Too bad that Reuters' photographer did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to go to the temple's Mount and who prefer to roar the Jewish faithful on the side, praying to the Wall of lamentations.
@ Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy appeared to be a real start, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever-greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grudging and mocking when someone else is doing the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being fooled with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like, for example, China and India.
This can't all end well.
It was because we were in democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in short-circuitant national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are those who make excellent spills, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, at the XVIII there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the sindicat of married men, celibataires, married women, celibataires, lost dogs and I don't know what yet.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm synthesizing.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of categorial interests, there is already enough experience in the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If not, it's a safe disaster.
And with the charts that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other public servants, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises. "
This is absolutely indispensable with the irruption of the informative power.
And yet you opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review."????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some of them have been seasoned well.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "butt, this is my fucking cake now grab it and bend in front of your master!"
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents out there finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all those outside persons were kept away.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, there is always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing this to myself.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them, and they had to make one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to split, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could find was the base a little dry (even if I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not make sense, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must confess that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time given.
There is also cancer that guts, with the solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything is successful right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and "cancers."
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are limited to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and most UVB pass.
You know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a rescued when you post a comment?
Especially for minor precision that was underheard in the commentary, which himself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I am an accustomed to melanoma, the UV only makes its development ACCELER.
They don't.
For proof: not all bronzated people have any melanoma.
Either, when a toubib tells you that you have to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it's better not to listen because the UV are necessary for all humans.
Excess, however, is like all: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we get it to the mixer?
or put it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if there is sufficient force and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if there is sufficient force
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about the folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production chain and we can't see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The Ebay photographs clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Al the article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrial 'We put forward super u but all the signs and mem the small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650 €(average wage in france)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.

For me, food is one.
Go without a rancune, I'll kiss you.
They are called bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, pretend to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left caviar, of which they are sometimes produced, for example by condemning CO2 releases while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, too, are not surprised to often meet criticism about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
You understand the concept of the left caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short ecolos.
The boboécolo is part of it but only represents the most visible fringe of ecolos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at that giraffe across the street.
She's so bad made that she looks vaguely like a female naked.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
We must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed by the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
This is art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Dessiner is much more than just representing the real.
If you're only looking for this, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings: horseback riding activities, number of republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
L (honesty requires to say that France is decreasing its strength, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, as we see the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad shot for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@ edmond: That's what I said, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at home it is really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have cooked little or prou the military thing dare come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without shattering to laugh...
The same potion will be applied to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defence can feel a little busy!
Well, yes, the economies that everyone agrees on say we have to do them, it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls mock at the murder when it happens at home, the poor cherished.
It would have to be done, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because, in that case, it's a crime, not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How to close the Val de Grace will weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history is repeated at every closure of the post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It's weird, a mayor UMP who wants compensation and does not look forward to savings in public expenditure.
This article is really the weirdest thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the deprime to scroll his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends began their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex in the bus going to work and realizes only where his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally asshole.
Not really, according to me, the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bore his emotions and to shake his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
You realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling at the spill!
It is essential that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible fulgurance and the insurpassable genius that spreads from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, that was so bad.
Especially if they're not women or travestis.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in the democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffes at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take care of things.
With the Commissioner that they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations went away...

All of this is financed by the Member State.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is best to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned in any way.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other steps.
Electricity through the wind or PV renewable is already more GHG on other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittence.
Replacing nuclear with wind or PV would be contrary to CO2 control.
Christial I am not insulting you I am Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and as all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an uncost-effective and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count greenhouse gas water vapour of lower effect than Co2 it is true reminder two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant leaves in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant..."!!
Last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indians who make comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had described India as a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, with the Kolkata Athletico imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison to the billions that India devotes to the cricket of the IPL and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "noisy neighbours..."
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests itself with a cold helium.
So we may not be in a design malfunction, but in implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private society, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is his own insurer..
Maybe they're gonna pay for the satellites in frigates that know..
This is all the more unfortunate as many media rebugged only article titles - and many readers withdrew only those titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
As you agree, the title is not appropriate, it unjustly calls into question the project while it is only a launcher problem.
