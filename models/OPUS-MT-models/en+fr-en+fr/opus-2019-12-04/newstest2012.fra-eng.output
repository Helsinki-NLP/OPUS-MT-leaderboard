Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has refused, in an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the charge of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
Members refused at second reading the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years' imprisonment for having concluded a disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the conviction in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's judgment of political vengeance and has led to a process of suspicions of court partiality also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
We still have to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery we cut our hands.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible non-respectful of faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Quran who will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society made up of opposing tribes.
In Libya it will be such an order that we cannot represent it and that we would certainly not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial to the Libyan people.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted the help with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an Americian General who led NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shooting, served Islam, and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to disembarke on "croisés."
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easily access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to fight for protection of human rights.
As soon as we prevent these sharia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the eyes of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on to Europe on Tuesday.
Each state has published the information relative to GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The offices of statistics in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
The GDP of Germany is expected to grow by 0.5%, the GDP of France by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (this was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that a gradual decline in economic growth is being made.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0, 5% according to planned and recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what the analysts had planned.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
10-year bond performance is 28.45%
The bond yields of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4%, while the situation is worsening in the region.
There are votes in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance.
The cheques qualified for EURO.
They won 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1: 0.
The Czech football has chilled with a good deal of luck also in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification game with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The mountaineers were under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitms of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of winning a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million kroons in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were difficult to set up combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footbalers has not been able to perceive the Czech defence, which has responded in a precise way to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Ispahan nuclear technology centre where uranium is being transformed.
They have thus openly expressed that they will defend their country's cloud programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel is reported to have a possible attack on Iranian nuclear settlements.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wanted the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The food of a child obese: does not take breakfast and grabs for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are above average and 5% are obese.
As the current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models surrounding it is.
For example, on the obese children's tables 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight are found.
19% of obesity had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of the big ones, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week the parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 students from the Czech primary schools.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a chance," supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from sixth to third have registered for this project.
One of the determinants that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the absence of a correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast in case - lunch - taste - dinner, which is a basic principle of good food," one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and carpentry at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that for healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In Chequia, only 23% of the students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes his own breakfast.
And the worst that has been noted is that one tenth of the population does not take breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned regularly sport but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes there are many cakes, meats and sucreries.
"The most alarming is in particular a great preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want crickets at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health Cap
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session" Obesity is not a chance, "there was a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet," says survey results.
The most important was for example with regard to sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked white meat and fish as a main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, says the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry about the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen later.
The presentations of three specialty professionals, the clothing of characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach final reviews and the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk."
This time we have with Director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard lies.
And women like this are the majority.
One has a little neck, the other has a boy's body, without a particular curve, another with overweight.
The stylist must know how to optimize wide arms, prolong a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to embrace the character nicely and also not to dress too visibly types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
If, for example, there is a difference between size and hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making it customized.
And you will not regret it because the garment that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides permanently, wraps and does not hold on to the belt and so on.
For those with a male appearance may be allowed a Tucker style clothing, with sewn tissue pieces, or embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I am also afraid that, given what I have to do at home, there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of mode of personality as well as its appearance.
I will have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, what you may know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Think about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist thus not only dresses physics but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphist, has maintained all of this.
But that,... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the speciality gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session full of information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one clothing in a different way.
Variability is for this paramount example.
As for example this trench-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with snacks and take it as a dress.
Or just go up the sleeves or the collar and have a new look immediately.
"Play with that," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start contacting it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the Ben mode photographer, that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "retailer" at least 15.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the successors has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who's not a great singer, but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In Chequie, the approach to the use of stylistic services remains frank.
And known faces sometimes regard them as useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes second).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than that he actually has.
We then have to navigate on google and make sure that the Boulevard news is about the celebrity in question, whether it has sore or grossi etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and to know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to guess people, not flattering, keeping his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you cannot throw everything and tell him, my God, what a horror."
"You will find some things that you will find beautiful and he you will advise with what to wear," said Mario.
This one has shown us what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It's the one you hang around the size and you have on your own for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depletion or even nursery pins, there are also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not utlisable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not just people who listened but tried something in a practical way they taught us how to look like shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could damage itself, in fortiori to the outside.
And so we snapped and snapped.
We had no right to touch the scissors so that we could not inadvertently hurt each other.
There is therefore a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I report is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend.
I am increasingly beginning to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a pink garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fulfils to a certain extent the ambition of everyone, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subsectioned part The Run produced great expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Needs for Speed race series and to get out some kind of game from playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how to be the rajoutted passages in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely other than what was expected.
These are potentially arcades racing games but the whole is shooting down because of some unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an ununderstandable weakness on the part of developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to resolve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
This results in each race being made on another route and the steps planned in different environments that are quite well distinguished from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are of surprises rather pretty even if the technical level of the graphics is the same type as the previous series.
It's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
In addition, the tests are once in a while accompanied by an atypical elite.
For example in the desert you are found in a sand storm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you must be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There is only a small number of them, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to surpass the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you will run against the watch (classic duel with the chronometer) and then again awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who tries to make you the situation dificile.
The novelty is off-vehicle passages.
It is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack fled in front of someone and you have to help him by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are less moments of this type than you are waiting for (to be concrete there are only three).
In the result it is well as this because this element is not likely to hinder and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embrace the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at this time, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go to another place.
But although we can find better in conccurrence the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
The problems are beginning to emerge after some time.
At the deferference of the driving model, that of collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car is behaving, so it is not completely good.
During tight overruns you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your auto shares in folly voltiges.
Or we'll be in a crumb.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem, but it really bothers you.
The restart is done so that when you broke the figure or you came out in the decor the game brings you back at the time of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have five reboots.
When you used the 5 reboot you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen properly, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the reboot does not help and we need to find the solution by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The great hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that must be passed in some way or it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place "civilian" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either set aside and dismount them or brake them.
It's equal if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
The opponents still have other advantages.
During the whole time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent before you in the same place.
This energizes the most at the end of the game when you roll on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When he passes in front of you he hides you the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter into a collision many times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adedaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it's a pity because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of bothering or something else.
The original idea is car change during the races.
You have to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change your car there, however most of the time that you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic atours on very technical pipes, for example on lacquered roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in special places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects on-line with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult beatings to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you roll in the dark on the lanes (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km / hour (at priori) and behind you comes a subway rame that sends the car directly to the scrap.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us as idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is uncomfortable is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases in a tragic way.
This especially concerns accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer for you.
The sound part is good and the track is to choose.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young public a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything," but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid errors we could say without fear that it was the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the flaws to tap you in your eyes with the force of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the choirs of Charles University

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players get used to their new role," is how Miléna Vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible manner, to the point that many speakers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envier her, she showed how much she took her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, he felt the criticism that he was fade, that he was a leather roundabout, that he could not fill any mission, and I must say that he had cut off everyone's breath because he held his role in perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to be taken from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?," so as an important step towards unicité and greater legibility of Union policy in the face of states, as is China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked dough cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also reported on the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in close time.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago as successors.
The Czech have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Oriental Partnership.
She described the fall of the gulf as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has befallen its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
In addition, it is necessary to approve the new septimal budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped most, least, everything is to be solved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe."
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As must be understood by the citizen, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, different large bananas or although no one has prohibited us from making syrecky. "
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A Europe with several speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czech people have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
In her view, the fault is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, it then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polonese, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French says to me," Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing? "and he is not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future it is new hard rules on budgetary policy that are waiting for Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, except at several speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for enhanced cooperation."
In the first place it was said that cooperation between those countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corner. "
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," she expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis for discussion between all EU members and not just the euro-zone membres.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocable that expressed the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term."
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and however since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be resolved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE '!" became the footprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because she has always remained faithful to her basic values and however has not been afraid to change all the others around her.
This has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "has spilled for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only one among the first American employees to have paid vacation, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed client relations system.
Society was at the beginning great in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is fully in line with the anti-discriminatory strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at IBM's head.
The company has been working at IBM for 30 years and is currently in the position of Chief of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years does what is called jamy, brain- storming online from what have come from many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that gives it a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technical firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue," as it is called in the United States with regard to its slogan- in a hundred years it has grown up until it becomes one of the world's largest firms.
It is of course the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, consultancy services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are the ticket distributor, payment card, financial swap, bar code or diskette.
IBM found itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.

Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed the bet on a own OS / 2 operating system, the Prodige service online or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance, you cannot emotionally stay grabbed on the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft conccurent that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for one fifth by software and hardwares, have a leading place.
However still in 1990 she was with more than the motive of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the major economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Now it appears that IBM is passing the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has progressed from 2008 in a 120% rocket, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this we can expect that this giant flexible masters other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheeses to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it was originally known as Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis for the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers," the pendules that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Board of Supervision of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of society have so far been based.
Watson led the Kusque firm in 1952.
IBM, as his name said, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheeses and meat trusses to the register box.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, turnover increased to $9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was so unreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of leadership his son occupied the director's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA to guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System / 360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The successful strategy for IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet."
Its objective is the smart use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
With regard to the IBM trade field recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps commercial people manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is located in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come back home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova a summer asylum in her house, she had no idea that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted to move from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
With the time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova split up there will be no wife to welcome her at the step of the door of the house.
"It's my sons' biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," let Rychtarova filtering by showing that she has separated from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed his door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we're talking completely normal but we're not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent him.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who and if she has an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take all responsibility on me," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: This also concerns you?
If you ask men to determine women's typical vices, all of them, both of them, are able to "get them out of their sleeve."
Dear ladies, you will know in the following lines women's vices that can pumping the blood from men's veins.
Procurement
Your half makes you remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and by packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women believe that they should restrict their passion for making purchases.
But you will say, which would resist the window dryer of the clothing stores, to look for good clothes for yourself and then try them all in a cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Remember only how many times have you told your spouse he's waiting for the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I need to eat at least 5 kilos - should I start sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed by their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase, and the more poison women become.
Width and cleanliness at first place
It's like an infinite manège.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, make the dust, drill the bathroom - and that twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that it walks with dirty feet on clean ground, to the children they sali the sink, cracked the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you just suffer from this obsession, try to have in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, ruin your relations and even family peace.
Sape work
"Put that used garment in the trash."
"You're planning on putting those old socks in tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this sape work on your partner this way several times a day, you are really going to break it out.
Obviously you don't think wrong you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much sape work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly focused on relations and thus are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us lets us escape a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflate, even despise others and are for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
The hokeyist attacker Jagr took part twice in Philadelphia's victory during Monday NHL's game on Caroline's ice and is again at the head of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game declared to the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great night.
"I told him before the game he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first Flyers shot.
A moment later there was a second attack on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to the Maxime Talbot butor.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part appeared in the Flyers.
Concretely to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the top three," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not remove any other complications that ended two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He taped on the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the corner farthest from the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I made it," described the last goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory at the head of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he went out in the second third party because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candidates did not hold against an experienced defender their two butset advance lost after a 2: 3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick, which most of all bothered the local coach rather than lost pearls because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement has not been enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our area."
For this we had limits, "added one of the P. K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How have travel prices changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 State travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time offered travel especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists were traveling for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962-1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovakian people) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually in Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter of invitation, or the individual travel was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West, but we had to take the tail all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The foreign exchange agreement that was the condition for travel to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, Czechoslovakian currency was not tradable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czech most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czech were buying and this habit lasts so far.
The Czech travel has since been a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czech spent 4 million days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakian people could not travel by plane for a long time to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organisations made Czech people sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trait of a Czech trip was at that time to take with self his own food preserved, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after dozens of years of freedom to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased what has led to another important moment around 1997.
As a result of an increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charters, which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s last century, Czechs had visa-free links with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU that later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
on 17 November 2008 the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully place itself in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czech for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kroons per person for holidays abroad including ancillary expenses.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end with a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost five months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic will not yet be known after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on what voting rules must be made.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to differences between the Association's chambers who cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on September 16 when a new President was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was no question even of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, apparently, statutory representatives or also staff members with full powers.
In this only point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Bureau for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the point of concern is still the same.
The question is how to proceed for the third round not to fall into the pat.
"The discord apple is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, in the third round, the candidates who have received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate will win.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw to win the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is considering the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only it would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely refuse the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits that understands the objections of the morave side and that the best would be not to change the rules and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the rules of procedure established by the statutes benefit Pelta most among all candidates.
"I wish to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"To ensure that there are not yet any sluggish ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will be once again on a wave of happiness and there is more training for cooperation," added Jablonec's officer who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czech and the Moraves, but there are trends to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This may again cause a blockade in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that good reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some reunions are expected to take place directly in Montenegro, but which can say if the entire football management will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight in which to travel to Podgorice, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the reprisal field.
At the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parties in the country's strongest sporting association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen Tomas Paclik's leader of footbalers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it would not be campaigning for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik said to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that at priori would be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he was to win the elections he would only hold the post of President until 2013 year for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
It is said that Paclik is particularly uncomfortable with the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union for Football of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with a reverted reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates' General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik said.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta was able to do so without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said a while ago "if Pelta became President, I sell Plzen's club."
In case Paclik triumph on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had finished with a fiasco, thought the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able, for example, to be a head of representation."
"But as manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik who in September drew great attention when he decided to cancel the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik states that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He is an example of his ability to run private firms and he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated his first division triumph with his support last May.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik who does not jackhe his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobby power with high-level policies would provide for more money from gaming tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If this is the gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I don't see any reason to pass on my Plzen club shares to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later, "said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of Football one of the candidates for the Miroslav Pelta Presidency promised that if it is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to disputes about the rules for elections.
Jablonec's official is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of today's football representation should calm this gueguerre before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not take place had just promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly, and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he added, but he is first and foremost linked with the Jablonec club, has worked many years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved which were not perfect as all found out."
"If there were not all these different interpretations we would have had a President since September," Pelta points out.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in case it doesn't work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he is trying, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized with regard to his training in law and that he was well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not been attacking Tonas Paclik in a long time either, but on the contrary, he has not stopped criticizing Pelta.
"He has been in football for a year and has already had a few successors."
"However, his attacks were not most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some people now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at his opponent's address but remains, he says, faithful to the prohibitions he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest-level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a football drummer.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the suite of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said CTK, the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring any change of people.
"I should be familiar with all employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scriptures planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of discord on how to vote in the third round we will be able to surpass it."
"Football needs credibility and will only get it when there is a new leader in his head," Pelta said optimistically two days before the day likely to be decisive for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his direction AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic in the General Assembly of Thursday, it would not like many people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member will take care of a particular area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so football can face a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not be represented as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is worth it and if I will have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and raise doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he was hesitant.
"Many people still told me that I should not give up because they would give up too."
"This is a trust I can't betray," he said.
The reason, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"For the last two years there has been a great deal of fact and I don't want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them." he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who were playing football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not to support someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would be only a President for Chequia.
"And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other morave, whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem currently is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel support from the Czech Chamber who elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successors," said Rajchl, who plans to save tens of millions of kroons from among his future successors on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with television and the game law.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united was a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would probably continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any significant change among the people in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successors," said Rajchl who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
Ovni-optic pataugeoires, beautiful pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after having turned the city or made a long walk - can let his legs rest tired in gas water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Extendue on her back in the water, she observed the artistially arranged cupoles, and was swimming against the Putten marbles who were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and had failed to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered pool was a pleasure to her, she would note in her book without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been sonded in this way by the architecture historian Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain." The municipal covered swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathtubs in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries, alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervente of bath culture.
Meder, explains that she has not much interest in sport but ell feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swimming bearers must only contemplate blue tiles and take care of the stink of Javel's water while joggers breathe fragrance enfling spicy forests or can listen to the gulls of joyful birds in the park.
"I once wondered why the pools must in fact always be so ugly," said the viennoise.
"I was starting a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubly reinforces the architecture
A diving in a pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on a transparent side, but reflects on the other side, however, the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolor tiles, dippers.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to make a jump in blue.
The collector Meder discovered outstanding copies during her research in Hungary.
Aside from the splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found waters containing nitrate in a natural cavern in karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a spa bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath we have the whole city in its eyes, we can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski runway.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open trays, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
the smell of Javel's water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths come from a sulfur smell, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba comes from a strong oil smell, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its limb sticks you to the skin as soon as you let slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricade land.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
By taking a look at the window of the building-Art Nouveau in red-white-yellow, she observed weed flourishing between tiles.
She observed a opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it can be discovered not only neo-Roman elements that have come out since its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style maure room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert Iris Meder - not just because it is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good performance to melt so different construction styles into such a wonderful unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the spa pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
German bank reviews speculation on raw materials in detail
From Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the stock exchanges on global raw materials, pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity to global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete line with Deutsche-Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of the experts in the meantime share the view that the bettermen have separated themselves from the offers and demand - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism of US competitors differently: He promoted to invade reproaches and said, "no case is worth the challenge of putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the Head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds its Image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on the rise in food prices shows in a particularly drastic way, how much the banks today are detrimental to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be today particularly under obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations," said Bode.
"It does not matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it is about starving people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything in the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One in two would terminate investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which food prices bets are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they were to learn that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would, as a result of the survey, resilient all investments for which money is injected into the speculations on raw materials.
43 percent would not advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% said they would think about the termination of their account to change a bank institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with high, low and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibitions in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
Now it is again open and takes place as an exhibition house.
If we are excited for a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bright and daring looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief towards technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer's pavilion for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture until today.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang up works of art, so not a good environment.
However it has been used so long, until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become more and more depressed.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, she carried out particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name have been exhibited there, there is a coffee and a bookstore, and there is an office to be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For Krischanitz realisation was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht with sensitivity and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Vienna Technical University and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and by his change of use.
In the current transformations, there were major problems: the "building was" a gulf in energy, "said Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass-reinforced insulation was placed and the roof was replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a stamp light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge led to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The exterior doors of origin remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was once.
And all of this under close supervision by the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and which also enjoy at the Office of Protection Monuments," said Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which was from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and wants to "awaken the right consciousness."
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is precisely set up the newly planned "central train station district," with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlinois temporary art centre, and as he says, she already negotiates with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter season-related train accidents and delays, the "Deutsche Bahn" railway company will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild" -Zeitung reported in advance by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the removal of rail and docks should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000.
The objective is to remove the snow and ice docks to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, train leader Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of train accidents also occurred this winter.
Last winter, the railway company had a lot of problems with the transport of users, because it lacked, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing something for years, since it has to check the ICE train axles much more often at the workshop, after a break of axles has taken place on an ICE in the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant catches it up in addition in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator brings a whole range of charges to large banks, which would have led cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and have led banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating court proceedings," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognize any misconduct by comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and in summer he assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The issue of mortgage documents is "Mortgage-backed Securities."
The credit houses are at the base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at present there is a storm wind on US banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought many remedies for reparation or for misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of complaints.
It reproaches 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate finance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for being in kind advantageous in mortgages of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask, that the Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but however without quoting a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not investing in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad pronostics.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IT IBM has the right to call itself "Mr IBM."
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic program, which he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large IBM shareholder with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, who even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has been working on IT lucrative services for some time as the operation of accounting centres.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultation as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he's only investing in the companies he understands business.
But on the contrary Buffett is fighting the rail fry, the manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has almost 80 subsidiaries as well as shares from a wide range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, ex Rück munichois.
This 81-year-old octogenar had resumed in the 1960s "the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had erected it as one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, its lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense to earn money earned him the nickname "Oracle d'Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett's investment IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue," as also named IBM, has a stock market value of over $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which would now return.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000-2006 had an extremist context.
As a result of this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population are reacting with fear and concern.
For many Germano-Turkish people, the spectrum that has been thought to be dead for a long time, has reappeared: since the Mölln burning attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no longer any violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, however, it has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology," "This was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily" Haberturk. "
The newspaper "Sabah", however, points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bourbier.
It was in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media have a slut effect: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not, therefore, deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
"It's starting to stink," This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's Chronic.
He pointed out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was seen in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not already come much earlier to the German authorities to do research in certain suspicious backgrounds of the extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is at least ready for rhetoric or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be built, there will be nothing but self-defence and arms for migrants."
"This will be the best self-defence."
"Internal peace in Germany is highly dependent on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network," writes "Selen."
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have made us feel better in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past errors
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of Turkish State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his or her tax expenses.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how much of the distrust of many Germano-Turkish people has been deep towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to clarify and reassess extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous Bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime rains from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to run now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July that he would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained strength and made some kind comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I am pleased with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
An UBS securities merchant in London had diverted all of the Bank's security systems and had flushed about €1.7 billion.
The head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered to be suffering - and all ask: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administrative presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At one point he took responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which had once again proved that it had long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank."
Indeed, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been raining from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also rushed, it had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank teacher in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"From the current perspective, we are wondering: how could I just have been wrong at this point?"
He made a deep mistake.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was so far considered an intellectual high as well as a great banker.
A few months later we pressenti why he left.
The bank division had flattered with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frayed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was passed in silence, to the point that we have never even learned its name.
However, this was only the first shot.
In April 2008, this worsened.
The bank was to reannounce billions of losses, with the President of the Board of Directors Marcel OGospel, who was still the second most paid board in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the State.
The national bank has bought from the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet for UBS 2007 increased Switzerland's economic performance to more than five times (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and expressed its readiness to publish data from the easy customers, who had frauded the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS published more or less that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This followed the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the loophole of the clients' money.
The bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a little return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would make it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title merchant of €1.7 billion, before the bank saw that something was not round.
And it is published: with risk management in investment bank it still does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk control is too little changed," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not have control over risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken up their function, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its seat at the central station of Zurich, which leads directly from the central station to the lake of Zurich, which it itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's, we find them here between the Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit palace to private elitist banks like Julius Bär.
We're coming to the UBS lobby by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, front of thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe."
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has once or again been discarded from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two large banks.
The UBS would have become much too large, he found - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And even so, they have long been adapted to the Anglo-Saxons' morals."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the subprime jungle like the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the large bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has recorded an ever-increasing increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had positive access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel OGospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and OGospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well understood in models and statistics, and OGospel, the intuitive, who has spared a path to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But OGospel would have fused until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same word of order: to deprive Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the case of foreign currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The company advisors, who have had responsibility for it, have, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the fixed income bank jargon, there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS started an adventure, which almost cost her life.
It is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-premium investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and passed value documents based on US mortgage - but that has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
"Still in progress in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the bank expert.
The greater the euphoria the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved to be more difficult than one thought.
Post at UBS has become ejectable and have so far become benches.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration in property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank has to be ruined vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be transient when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has compelled himself: he must carry out the UBS's business on a long-term basis, "said the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He said publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview at CNBC.
As a result, it was from his point of view too early to invest in obligations from European states and banks.

Intelligent horneilles spread in cities
In many places, freux are considered "bird problem °" but experts say that these very smart animals have not been hunting cities for a long time.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Corsemen have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are increasing due to the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "° bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on horns, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase the freux of cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The protection of nature was based on the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected freux: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and slaughter of typical cover trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneilles are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cover couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements as a result of the slaughter of crows in this region.
Critics found birds caught in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," said Leer's city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or lowering trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr at Bade-Wurtemberg.
"Animals are moving away, large colonies are divided and scattered in other places."
The eviction is only imaginable in exceptional cases, such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer's opinion.
Concevable is a combination of evincing animals to an aversive conditioning and hanging offers, to allow them to reset elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was prospecting "info panels instead of trunks" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better stand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-cheminement-éducation des crotches at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent freux.
This project was in the meantime adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a great number of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freux not only use work instruments to reach a regal but they themselves make their tools as work instruments.
Ethologists from Cambridge University were testing four freux recently, how much the intelligence of birds happens.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to crush a scaffolding with stones to achieve a larvae.
Without much training, they determined that a stone had to have certain sizes and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second trial, astucious corneilles had to solve a more trapu problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larvae.
The birds couldn't reach their butin with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of iron wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they were fishing for the small bucket of the small hose.
Three of the four freux are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a Bosnian and Turkish coup remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets in the Eliminations at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and by coup eliminated Ukraine.
Drived by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal has plunged against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made perfect, after the 0: 0 of the game, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the Eliminatory Return game by Montenegro 1: 0 (0: 0), while the first round (2: 0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in the 0: 0 game between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1: 1 (1: 0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other tires for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a 11-metre penalty played by hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the Eliminations for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre slot in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his tires at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English Manchester City Championship, initiated a headball directed below the cross-section bar, and the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek has drawn a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, Adjudicator Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the centre of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 metres played by controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-Champion of Europe has been successful four times and everything has become clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also completed the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to EM for a fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with legionists Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech goal-keeper has prevented with a reflexe a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world class guard of the Czech already shot, again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond a 0: 0.
While National Coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 third-party EM bench, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, replaced by Ivan Perisic de Dortmund at 62 th Minute, the legionists of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have been celebrating their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a success of 4: 0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first butor.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defence of the goalie Pavel Vancak, Ward was within reach and will shake the ball on the line for 1: 0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, will invest billions in chine in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about $2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, said the Dax Group Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world's business software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," he starts with a long list of characters that shake your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear this page and make it your page mark.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this romantic story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the brumes of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written here an out of the common book that he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." There are "feelings, impressions, experiences and humors."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in war time of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulanciers and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Some of them are prisoners of war, some will lose members, become crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives are flowing here like the cemeteries of a church: while some people are extinguishing, new ones are raised.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He denied the idea that the First World War was only summed up by the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" is a good description of other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one Christmas passes in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsé-tsé flies are an unbeatable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina who stinks the cordite.
When gunshot wounds away, and you're a home mother, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been complemented by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoranda, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved by the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are dealing with deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
By telling the story of a German schoolman, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false bone of wood); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; soles of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 substitutes are registered in the production of sausages and 511 substitutes are also found."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own pulsion towards rescue and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sit in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretend that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your emptied and cloutted shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When you are resigned to sacrifice yourself, you hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man who is strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grabbed the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-wrapped clothing, who performs his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviours as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried to catch a venerian disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and" spread on the genitals in the hope of ending in the hospital, "he writes.
"The most desperate are applied to the eyes, which results in blindness for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped the way in which the war "triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion for religion."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West nothing new," by Erich Maria Note, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he had come out of his book, grabbed in your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first fake step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret with all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence stressing the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who have gone against the department's regulation and have caused a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the movement of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that are to move a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session was held on Monday night on the East River Manhattan side.
The orders given to move to the park have arrived "at the last minute," a habitual said, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few police officers I know who were called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park," said the person on anonymity.
"The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the police department's hierarchy."
The city was able to learn a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park, but had hundreds of demonstrators who informed about the plans.
The Tuesday operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers used in particularly criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages of speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community business officers entered the park with their clear blue windshield, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1: 45 p.m. declared the police, which allowed the occupants time to gather their cases.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson for the head of the police department, said that this action had been taken only by security.
However, according to many journalists, the police have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which is strongly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the thick business scraps of the demonstrators, including baggage, plastic grass and garment-filled paper bags, the Sanitation Department teams followed, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people have been chained to trees, "said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services have been called to cut the cadenas.
No arrests took place in the park before 3: 30 p.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, almost 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "public order disorder and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer who was found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police personnel were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were placed on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
The police were seen to expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the strongest actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5: 00 a.m., south of Pine Street, one demonstrator jumped over the hood of a police car. Others were seen diving the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out flying the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The school aid union sues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to start a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the 37th District Council in an attempt to have the dismissals cancelled.
Six hundred and seventy-twelve school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, one of the city's least paid, lost their jobs on October 7. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to political vengeance for not letting the city have access to a health care fund led by workers' groups, which would have allowed the budget gap to be closed last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this charge.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, stating that the redundancies of school aids were not specified in any way in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the judicial proceedings at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defending party. The complainants will be represented by eight redundant women, all of which are black or of Latin American origin, like most school aids who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in schools in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose most support due to regular underfunding.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx districts.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aids in State school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution states that "It is not a neighbourhood of easy parents that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrolment.
The union also states that school directors could have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "override" to describe the action, even if "override" more generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," and "not only because of overcrowding."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
It would finally appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement at the Capitol on the question of uprising in Lybie.
A successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement will have been necessary.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachussetts), with senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress is contrariated enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut his grass under his foot.
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October last year.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "commends the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators like last June?
The senator and president of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitole, this week the House must vote for an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congress Republicans, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to have their amendments approved, but it is not without having tried.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to be presented to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill in both the House and the Senate - and others are small variations in a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - in particular the new Republicans who wish to have their CV - the chance to be "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democratic - New York) wishes to lift the two-term limit for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democratic - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between same-sex individuals is always proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the defamation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states are opposed.
As hard as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacea but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords at her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, singed "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said that he wanted to first get back to Congress rather than return.
When she appeared in the television newspaper "20 / 20" on the ABC channel, next to Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and singed - and described her recovery as "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said "pretty well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Astronaut Mark Kelly, took place in a special one-hour edition of "20 / 20," broadcast the day before the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The special show has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the 8 January shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, we see him on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on the front.
She can use only one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A lip movement.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is being seen singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?. "
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spend two hours with the doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article on the shooting of March 12 when she stopped him and for the first time asked for information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and strongly treated pending trial.
"There have been many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say," Gabby, you were not beaten, "said Mark Kelly.
You were just slaughtered.
And you're gonna be all right, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock singed a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a suit-tie set up at his feet to acclaim him.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armies, also participated, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan," the high-grade military wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military personnel.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier-General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us into the role of unfortunate spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most pity conversations are held in full confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they have been confronted with insurgents and have travelled to distant areas.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran was hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government of Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who made him go through the interviews asked in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold the stressful job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you look at the subject of service, you face negative impressions," says Colonel Cancian when he talks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference towards wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a military member.
The troops are recognized for the number of periods of hardened service, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army face the growing pressure to resist rapists
This week, a capital audience will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction about rapes.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She went back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"It" was an alarm signal, "says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane put aside his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, threw her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others no, will anxiously wait for the court decision in an historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the widespread use of rape in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number was 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's dealing with the gallied military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries to active personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defence refused to make any comments.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in reaching out to local women.
As a result, 150 women soldiers lost their lives on both wars - two thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in carrying out this fight: three other trials are under way in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Service Centre is preparing a case against the four major military academies to have allegedly encouraged a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of "personality disorders" attributed to victims of rape to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.
His group brought a trial in December at the Valérans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who reported having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases registered in the army were tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first of a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her assailant's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was asked about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her aggression.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I was out, I remember telling my commander" It was not his trial but mine. ""
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was sent back in less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Is the Lyman case and other complainants going forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this criticised doctrine since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind it because it does not have the same benefits and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
"The chances are heavy against them... but it is important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, counsel for the complainants, will bring together her hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged having been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social network sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy... log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by DEMOS's Reflection Group on Digital Populism in Europe.
Facebook has so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision - how mercaticians have done so for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer an investigation. The questions asked were their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters from 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is only one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Reflection groups, medical researchers and policy scientists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, through "I Love," wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research work whose name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage is that it allows you to study people that you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their scratch exploits were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggested that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would be too often referred to as alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," said the Washington Post, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly accesses to the information of its users.
The data team of the site studied statistics on the situation in love and the day of Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - the digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they have not even heard about?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is all else online.
"I don't think many users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As long as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a note block and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not before a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that made 77 deaths in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Templates of Norway," he explains in front of a 500-person courtroom.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I recover it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologist because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind the bars.
All took part in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I was not comfortable, but I personally made some progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
Sold of a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained quiet and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes when he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a large movement of "resistance," the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he has acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may make some of them comfortable.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred that he looks like a monster, but that's not the case," said a victim's parent.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs's lost interview at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford - distinguished by technical engineering and inventor of modern computer.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how creative that spirit had understood the processes and workflow of products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "disease to let them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series retrace the birth of the computer, and he sat down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It is only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly upgraded, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiastic to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, with the aim of providing a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs's perfonism resurrects, where it seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him an elbow to speed it up and move to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and shows his own vision about the future of computer.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs's career, but there is something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then put them in action.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"For all these years, I have always asked," Why do you do things? "and the answers are constantly the same:" oh, just because we have to do them. ""
No one knows why, no one thinks in depth about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details about his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexe as to how the costs were recorded - often start with a "standard cost" assessed with a view to nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a turn to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells about the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and call free on long distance.
The device has been the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs's euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call then connecting from one AT & T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," said Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we were able to invent a small thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without that.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak have developed: he called to the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by being called Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awake.
On his love with technology (and unmerging by Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, at the spare parts hunt to make a firemeter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me." It was the only company I saw at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated. "
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, possessed a little cathodic tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager that I was was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs is talking about inventing new products on a headshot.
At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit cards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days' credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... they were yelling at me by pretending that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Eighty-ten days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are crumbling:
Long before he made Apple live again, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these types of people] end up directing companies and product staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely roasted by people who cannot imagine designing a good product relative to a bad product - the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox's...
Xerox could have held the entire computer industry.
She could have made ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They raided the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you are creating.
Picasso once said that good artists are copying and that great artists are flying.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved themselves the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law while the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets in private to discuss the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for examination.
One of the cases in question was a trial by 26 States challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5: 30 is expected next March, and the result will likely be such as to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing as the court's decision is made.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and will argue on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the general solicitor of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pfizer Inc., which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top republican of the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising of law and other organizations, although the judge cannot be an intervener, a guest of honour, or on the program of such an event."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, has sufficed to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference with respect to the Code contradicts the statements by several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dinner and a gala fund-raising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantle any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for the criticism that they are too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics put pressure on Kagan to get back to hearing the case, saying that she had been too involved in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records a record $18 billion order for line aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way airplanes, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplant 50 of its products.
It is, however, a whole business when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It was the airline Emirates based in Dubai who passed this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, called Dreamliners, a model that flatters large fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
These six aircraft amount to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular are of great value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually damaging to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so damaging to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the oil price increases, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's predominance in the big-carrier aircraft market and helps to curb the Airbus competitor's attempt to empietly with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Show arrives four months after Airbus's announcement to postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which rivalises directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus repulses its debut to increase its momentum following the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of Mexican President manifestly defeated in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race to the position of governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her attempt to access the functions of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have favoured one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race as governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... they took the polls, installed road dams... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have started only a few times from Calderon, who was at the head of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-hand candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently acting as governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidencies for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the State, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the State of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has persisted.
One week before the elections, a NAP mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates renounced the campaign locally by fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to support the euro area
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the general director of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers with the fastest growth in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with "indifferent eyes" and said that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain point, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will prevent them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing is dangerously rounded and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has brought about the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has raised the call for the major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag presumed that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - like buying the obligations of the United States Financial Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - provided a greater negotiating power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans when they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to have aid to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or even less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and that they go on a vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant impacts" across Asia.
BASD's forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011 / 12 now faces "loss risks" as a result of the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop" relief plans "to protect themselves from economic reversal and significant capital leakage.
Pentagon Fees Warning on Potential Defence Reductions
Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would know national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan battlefields, through the assemblies of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digging $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an expenditure agreement.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the department," said Panetta in a letter to Senator John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23 per cent reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the objective."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the financing in time of war of the accounts of contingent operations abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disturbances in basic budgets," Panetta said.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war."
"Staff managing salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupt."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defence.
"The result of a sequestration on the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are strongly opposed to this draconian action," said senators in a joint communiqué on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence we can live with, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings increase pressure for a fiscal compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he has arrived at the highest post of the Pentagon, combining years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a member with a shell, but no kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's a hunting aircraft, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that have not enough trained soldiers capable of performing the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"De facto, she invites to aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could go through the couperet, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal warship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and the Navy.
To put an end to the development and testing of F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent shutters indicates how much deception and lie are omnipresent in daily life.
Republican candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone affirming to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has passed as an idiot by quickly emitting denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the coverage of an extraconjugal liaison.
And then, none of the people who lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The trichery stories at the school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the student test responses in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and trichery are acceptable.
How many deception are we meeting?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I have had you," the detection of trumpet is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on lies have been demystified.
The liars look in your eyes.
They don't shake, rugged, or always shake.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to dismask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years looking at scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are able to read others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extravagants lie more than introvertis, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of your subject.
This is called "establishing reference data."
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally wins his feet permanently so that you don't throw unfair accusations when you see him stirring his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for evidence of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People who are misleading can imitate the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet to the door, look to an exit, change posture significantly, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated suspicion of relief, a change of posture when all difficult questions have passed.
Interviewees often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped out using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The misleading individuals can also use a distanced language: "I have not had any sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a very difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember good... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by arnaqueurs in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be dismantled after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - stirring the anger of trade unions while apaising the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to redirect it to the track.
TransCanada stated Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitole du Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, states that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval from a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, he would have to cross six states.
He is haunted by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators who are opposed to this plan are pressing that a law to force the distance from the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact assessment found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor for Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family states that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva launched in a tear of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited from it in fear.
The singer's tiger "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so much that she underwent "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was on November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his child garden teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for family travel.
While Kevin Monk was going to get the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," yes, "and I went looking for her," she said.
LaBelle has annoyed the pregnant woman.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone," You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door, "Roseanna Monk said.
"I said," I am not interested in what you say or think. "
She became enraged and started using jurors - the word "" and the word "with a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to drain me some water from the bottle.
She said that so far, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to that woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who trained her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get any answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle didn't return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family counsel Sam Davis stated that he took the case free of charge and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a work of charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has freed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, who has generated great expectations about the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange for a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing losses of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of jellies by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Railland Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage, the main affected crops have been vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the State until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the State for the first three quarters of the year has been accelerated, as between January and March 55 thousand 053 sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the active economic population, in the second quarter the rate has become 5.28 per cent and between July and September the average has continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloans unemployed, with an increase over 18 thousand people in the first half of the year.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal way it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and to use them in something," he says.
Migration held
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering them already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, so unemployment increases," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in Greece is worsening by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
In addition to unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state is low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, very below the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June the State's FDI has reached $630 thousand 697, a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 billion pesos and until November there was no profit of debt in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the patronal sector, Mario López Valdés's first year of Government shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Industry of Transformation, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and above all the good work already synchronized of this new government team, hopefully that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and have restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flux is produced by several events, between which the jellies, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level e flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronale Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the State towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate all the potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do.
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better channelled the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked hard and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his alternative of possession of marihuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was circulating in a white-coloured pick-up truck in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's luggage holder and in the place of the co-pilot a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of the Delits.
Liabilities to contributions to works
Social works contemplated in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that even though construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a situation of risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He reported that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is about 50 million pesos, whose State is to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and Municipe have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing, even if since July they have to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record delays, we have started the books and we have made great progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to seek credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already undergone this in the previous sexennial period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year we, in order to have access to these programmes, had to get the resources to cover what the State had not paid," he explained.
Despite the State authorities' commitment to provide these resources, he said that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the actions so that the corresponding percentages could arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given us nothing."
Court validates "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog markings by digitals is one of the more important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has led to constitutional controversy that both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree which presupposes the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been brought together.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree which details the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, has been defeated for not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a statutory award to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversy to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all of the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also resolved to lead to the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider it only if it is to affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the management of the State.
The substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and this is reflected in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Ajourning change, he argued, would defer the benefits of digitalization that implies a decision in the public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, "require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of State economic direction, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the State Executive."
He recalled that many countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have the very specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in one form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the legislative, he assured.
We analyse the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with respect to the election trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Pre-liminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6 thousand 74 minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llangian Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, in the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to enter into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish it within the time limits provided for by the Law of the State Official Journal, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative authority and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "punish or challenge them."
Interviewees on the possibility of "voting by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanänder said that with the approval of the relevant guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to achieve the partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, the partial count of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no ballot record and there is no record of the ballot box in the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election polls may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the respective election and the candidate who obtained second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the party representative and / or coalition who presented the second of the reported candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the common count it follows that the difference between the presumed winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose second-out candidate, in which case the electoral packages that have been subject to the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the total 923 minutes.

Felipe Bacio Cortés has abandoned the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he even had a truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for that he knows that his uncle is dying by doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.

Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots fired in different parts of the body and with the coup de grâce, in an abandoned property of the municipe of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the beige colour and coffee the portal was widely open.
By looking inside, approximately three metres away, they localized the bodies of three people, so they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a distance of one metre there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were spread on the belly.
According to data obtained in situ, the three persons were murdered in another location, because in situ sockets were not found.
In the closing of the property there were legends addressed by an organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet openings in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who formed part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipe of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnapping, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burial.
According to information published, in a first fact on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of his liberty was managed to save.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas."
In another event, which took place on 12 November at 6: 00 p.m., military personnel made a monitoring course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a registration plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a shipper and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are given illegal burial in the municipes of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the verge of the economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and has put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even though it is not clear when the new executive will take up his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the President the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well traced," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to support.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity required by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the instability of the markets placed the performance of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years over 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's success opportunities were greatly stimulated by the support of the Silvio Berlusconi PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will probably be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that Monti's bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups, youth and women's organizations.
He will end his meeting tour Tuesday at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief rehearsal at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians will only give it time to implement the reforms before the elections are advanced.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it must be trained only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is higher than that of the Costaricans
Of the 22 footbalers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica's, compared with the 22 called by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3: 05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one of FIFA's monthly ranking, record a large register of class A interselectionals, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached on Friday last in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footbalers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the First League of England, maintain an intense year of activities in national league and Cup championships and disputes in European cuts such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated elimination of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footbalers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the larger record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalie Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) has equated the record of the former goalie Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a brain driver from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA next to the other centenaries of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front centre of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the Bryan Ruiz butor, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still not starting.
The historical butor of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also be a dream that has become reality to happen in this country.
It is that the bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, exclusively with Viva of Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
This day will be on the National Stade, starting at 7: 30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an extract of the conversation, the full transcript of which is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I only spent the holidays in Costa Rica; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
It is therefore an emotion to wear our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live with intensity in previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time has had to pass to this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the largest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows we have offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has set us up for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to doing this.
We love this country, we like to surf and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and his waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through the gents who love surf.
When you see the tour, you are offering huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and diverse directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that for?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each one loves different songs, that's why it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each night.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us to stay concentrated and surprise us because it reminds us of the reasons why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue to make music together emotions us a lot.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement comes out of a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group comes out of a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very strange that a group like yours will keep together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups normally last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, second, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical bakers that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you were able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we did not publish a record before Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration about the fact that she lasted so little and the most important is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
For what do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's singing it and I think he's doing it with the first words he can imagine.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I have just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have arisen at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At first, his music had more obscured content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change for?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them, and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music, and these songs, probably, represent that for me.
I also think we can also be happy and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for his loss of muscle force in the peas, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of New Plastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of force in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the surrender of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, probably, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been made four times of language cancer, has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastrite, a pancreas cyst, kidney calculations, high blood pressure and traffic problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official cortège, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will launch this Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "favourable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French agent Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by his ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has been presiding over the G20 since November, a group of stronger emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to dispatch the implementation of tax exchange agreements to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "gri list," integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004, with a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the bad Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of young people in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at stores all over the world, was designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say how stereoscopy must work without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support," because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less clever users.
Once surmounted, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "do not suck to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional incursion of Super Mario also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, which was no longer happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a blink of eye to the saga followers and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber must run through mined platforms of perils to release to Princess Peach.
Even if I find new things in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable."
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US $70 million.
The trial thus ended so that Guatemala would respond to the request of the northern country that requested Portillo to judge it.
At the press conference, Colom stated that its decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given rise to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former representative for the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diversion of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was President, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition to this is the long centenary of working positions currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are not trained, without work, with addiction problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, has shown the unitary character of Trinijove's work.
Along with the President of the Regional Government Catalan (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Advisor Ricard Goma.
In the large room of Fabra i Coats also attended the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general charity director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated themselves from 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building that they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-parties that despair neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to avoid the situation being repeated.
"From this day on there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving any kind of residue, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despised the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that from the time of the building's occupation his case has fallen a 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had had to respond to the complaints of neighbors for noise, while, according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the discotheque clients, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irrity neighbours of the area.
The disco manager explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it's been nine months since he "forgives her" rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common life and civism that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there had been flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be implacable against antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police moved to number 35, rue Mont-ral, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people were acceding to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide with the opportunity of the convocation beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 gates opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-1980s, in the wake of the already-extinguished Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed promotion posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the only Catalan capital that does not turn on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is in favour of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors in Collserola.
A door gives the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and with regard to reflection on the city is a theme of conversation by all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials speak about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And that is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three architects from Barcelona, university teachers, who have presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of the green house pats, has not been completed.
"It is necessary to get out of the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect gave the verdict for which the title" Gates of Collserola "contains a" lexic trap ": one must not think of them" like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils."
Perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and who had in the Forum area "his swan song."
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overcoming.
"We need to think of new urban and planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause genuine disasters."
On the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles region of Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat which "must not be lost," thanking for the opportunity that the city hall offers its company to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
In addition, he heard that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the only lead that architects can enter into the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success," he said) that we must have created: "We architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona insists that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the bases of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-cutting competitions - he said - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can choke in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In her opinion, yes, the city hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmailing
After having spent 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of the Casino Red gives him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Royal Casino attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás required him to pay an economic share so that the Mayor of Monterrey would allow the illegal operation of the gaming house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANist and on 2 September he was arrested and held in pretrial arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Ministry Officer 3 of Patrimonian Delits, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old State Capital District.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's Office had resulted in corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta criminal centre presumably for having blackmailed with one and a half million pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the closed trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the deposit of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gaming house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's Office officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who partners of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197 / 2011, legal forgiveness was granted to Jonás Larrazábal and, later, no claim could be made for the trial against him; no compensation and no punishment would be sought either.
After the hearing of the founded of the legal power of the playhouse, at 3: 50 p.m. Larrazabal Bretón was ordered immediate freedom.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to San Nicolás municipe de los Garza prison to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his file would be closed.
He will also provide him with the immediate order of liberty that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost his life
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (TBS) informed that the results of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lost their lives indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have had contact with the trees 25 metres away where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In one research it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structured.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating in cruise speed and it happened on an ascending soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal operation cruising at the time of the impact," he said.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft moved towards the boundary area between DF and the state of Mexico there were low-height nebulosity layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that "due to nebulosity conditions the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Localization of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight trajectory
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remnants dispersion model assumes that the helicopter struck against the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
Traces of fire or explosion have not been detected:
In the disaster site there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that has since been seven unleashed at 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in a larger area than the surrounding location around the accident, no dispersal parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetic protocol of obesity of children and adolescents', which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a communiqué, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 20th Century National Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Investigation and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnical Institute (IPN).
In the investigation it is called upon to participate in the right-wing population, to present themselves to the participating sports units of IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is made to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtemc Sportive Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity took place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sportive Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowledge of the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on November 14 on World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that samedis will be applied to all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, size circumference), blood pressure, glucose level determination, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (people associated with child obesity are being identified).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming taking of weight in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there had been an increase of 77 per cent in obesity for boys and 47 per cent for girls; with regard to overweight there was also a dramatic increase, 'said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have 65 per cent of Indo-American heredity, 30 per cent European and 5 per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are translated into the inability to brush the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which allows them to be detected if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila itself says that the presence of dark-colour folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of metabolic and even pre-diabetic changes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, to which each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to achieve to prevent diseases is explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarianism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of TV and use means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, that is, the greatest consumption of sweet drinks, carbon hydrates (tamals - meat pale with maize flour wrapped in maize leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
The asphalt of UNAM would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called Malthenes, which together give the pavement its viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behave as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes broken, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones baigned in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he said, is baigned an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through by generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would propagate better, hopefully the chemical ingenuity.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one is putting a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also baited in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion to the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it have an adequate thickness and the material made of it must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, as these affect the performance of the asphalt layer considerably.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to get out, which ramollizes all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes cassis.
In the formation trial of a cassis, he said, the first that is ruined is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Searcher System explained that vehicle load is another important factor for cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to invest and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of miss Colombia.
Valle received his title number 14 as a princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accréditates it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanedo (1993), Gjul. (1993), Gjul. (1993), Gjul. (1993).
Today the great question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been in vain elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the reins Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro that took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the juror to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she has not convinced with her answer to the question "? What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is Valle's candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culture, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is" The little prince, "it is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Arrow of Blood."
This answer did not like first because of the term "culturalize" and secondly to not explain in what way each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony stated that she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what is going on.
And for everyone, please read, "The little prince" is a great book. "
Between the hypotheses that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insisted that being the favorite, the ovationee and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft suit, and Queen Mother), "it woke up the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And it was noted in his first presentation in a swimsuit at Hilton beach and his two parades the day before the coronation.
Even if both parades had seemed certain of itself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program (as at home), of the RCN Canal stated that the fact that Melina had been designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the awards during the competition does not receive the queen's crown."
Besides, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the Beauty National Competition.
That is why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one must look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his flaws of his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The reine preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina had not the best body, that there was better, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too well known, left him points on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical interventions she had suffered.
"The surgeons are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of this aspect. "
For this award, which the Beauty National Contest has first given, after the parade in a swimsuit has arisen a cruel prediction that was made last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made in Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the reins that despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali has passed to history like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano '.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past November 4 a typist from Cali's ITC has passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano," confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the CTI local offices, this week it was the "availability 'turn of Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó's municipes, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place in which the bodies were to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having taken appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, that is, paumes and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who was leading the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the corpse, he did not recognize him by his physical aspect, because he was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much skinny.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Weltonian wolf, ink, a breeder and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not cheat on him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the leader who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
Looking for the footprint
For a typist of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Aside from identifying corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of persons captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher argued that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights," he remembers.
The fingerprints may also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently, we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
It was determined by the intercourse of the investigation that a parent may be suspect of the crime and indeed a imprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it does not guarantee that he is the assassin, it places him on the scene of crime.
A CTI typist explained that "fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted."
When they appear, a dryer or a strip is used to take them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of the declinents, or to the Civil National Register.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the expert from the ITC.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not become a strong footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignés" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a neighbouring park.
The integrants of the Occupe Wall Street movement defied the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to reenter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of protesters were in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allowed the "indignés" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the 'indignés' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg arrived to the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignés' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, by ensuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are centenaries of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some internally displaced demonstrators were wearing and distributing copies of this judicial order at that time and they even delivered it to the agents who were monitoring the place, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit protesters from reaccessing the park with tents or other properties they used previously'.
Mayor Bloomberg reported to the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, to which he alerted, however, that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation made at dawn in place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place in which people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt others," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation this morning at dawn has been disgusting and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
"Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think of organizing "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be out in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," helper in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crèche a doll that represents Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appeared come Joseph.
Along with Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American 'whore' Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earthquake
GDP increases 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to definitely turn the page: GDP increased 1.5% from the previous quarter and 6% at annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since the period January to March 2010.
Recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the decrease of 0.9% in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow zero.
Japan has woke up mainly as a result of changes in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the nippone currency - became one of the "hobby values" elected by investors who flee the debt crisis in the eurozone and the forecast unrest of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made the yen's contribution responsible for their low performance between July and September.
While markets continue to siege in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not fall guard.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Minister of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflationary points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being constrained.
As it decreased four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in aout.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, n falling eight decimals up to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservative will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainties resettled in the parks, Greece continues to interfere in the labyrinth leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday reported that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment will be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the scheduled date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no's message unfolds doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything more."
The Conservative Leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the organizations that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently requires, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the whole of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesperson Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greek still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "leading" place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading place in the role of micro-finance."
Queen Sofía recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is "an instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V-th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the assurance that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and "very specifically, in the one that aims to reduce half the volume of people living with income under one dollar per day, to which the" poverty line "is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with" responsibility, "said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will extend until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "faced many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be stimulated.
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they live now.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, said Queen Sofía as "an act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," the work she had known since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know his lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous development," explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday to Valladolid the term "head of the family" from the "banker of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofía completed her intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Epidemiological Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a tic imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be an error to invigorate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez has considered that microcredits assume "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people" to which all close the door "; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that" opens his contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity. "
CDU proposes to elect European President by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme, but was set in the fall, especially to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too laxist to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The several-minute standing ovation to which Angela Merkel was entitled, after their interventions, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European Finance Minister, did not leave any room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen European Union control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe."
This is in any case one of the motion adopted by the congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile to it.
But the jealous is laid.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weighted the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
In order to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that are quick to criticize the German arrogant.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does fraud mean to sick stops?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government are launching the offensive on sick stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is based on a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
First, for fiscal savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before a job stop is taken over.
In clear terms, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, thus at least 15% of his or her monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but would bring back EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, which is more symbolic in scope: to impose on officials a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of an interruption of work (they do not have a period of deficiency so far, compared with three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the issue of fraud, targeting this time the abuse of work stops.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," said Xavier Bertrand to the RTL micro, Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stops.
This has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, which have most often been successful.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were for sick stops, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken any day off.
Another study, this time of Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere to work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence rate (for health or non-health reasons) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick stops is very little in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it is only small in size.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls on sick stops of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 cases for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long," or 37,050 cases.
In the case of judgements over 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "inappropriate or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick stop.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, to that of black work.
According to Member of Parliament UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax shortages per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud against them.
Papadems: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadems said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to do this.
"To continue efforts to rebuild the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public address at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadems has planned that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unleash the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures planned, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign under external pressure.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in the denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an important report by the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to be made with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Drugs or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, the rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that are contrary to the federal government's position, which has already said that it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on uncompetent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, yesterday, on teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, there are more cases of such overcrowding specifically in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It is recalled that 85% of Canadians have already expressed their support for euthanasia because they believe that it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have been involved in assisted suicide, respondents estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, says the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in respect of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada experts' report.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be tired of life and who was over 18 years of age could ask for help in suicide," said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the individual's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he said, "there are tags and constraints."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifest."
Margaret Somerville, who is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad supporters protested yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Bashar al-Assad Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League had suspended Syria, the European Union had strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bachar was in the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview at the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have led to a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country towards which Turkey adopts an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone," said Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians died "in the exchange of fire and heavy-duty machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem felt that the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis."
He has also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his work, which he believes is "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not fall," he added, ensuring that "the hourly conspiracy against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes is locked in the "paranoia."
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in question and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held yesterday that the Arab League's decision was "incorrect," while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while retaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has claimed a little time for the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices," in order to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after having met the President of the designated Council.
The President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti's presentation of a limited list, probably a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are specific time frames" to prepare a government and its program, "he said," certain that markets will be patient and understand. "
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but concern resumed above, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team with mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies."
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he estimated.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti made a commitment, once he took office, to work in an emergency and in order that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, inter alia, new rigour measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters."
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy," according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in State bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop an usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the centre to establish a "nano-diamonds" company in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, prior to his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as one Member State has informed the Agency, worked during most of his career on this technology within his country of origin's military nuclear programme."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly, according to the FBI statistics made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are motivated by differences in race and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to address these abuses," he said, "it might be an improvement in police reports on" hate crimes. "
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more smoothly, live, the activity of other "Twittos," the Internet users who are followed by the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, told AFP Twitter's spokesperson, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invading, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"Activity feature will help me better track some of my Twitter stream," sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a budget "gold rule" in the constitution
The ruling social-democratic / Christian-democratic coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign note (triple A).
The social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below country debts such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was lowered by only one cran, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros in additional interest each year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian-Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows up on a request from the Brussels Summit of the euro area member countries of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model," with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% each year of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not exceed 0.35% each year of GDP, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt to 2020 / 21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Nippone authorities would reintervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we last did if we see excessive volatility in the yen's exchange rate," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back to historical levels, which prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yens massively for dollars in order to lower the value of the nippone currency that had just established a new record of strength since 1945 against the green ticket.
But the yen has been routinely reassembled since then, driven by investors' purchases that consider it a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the nippone currency is detrimental to the exports of the archipelago because it redeems the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan has been fighting to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), "said Noda, who fears that this recherishment of the yen will kill in the egg the fragile recovery.
The third world economic power rebuilt with growth in the third quarter -1.5% from the previous quarter - for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households plumbed by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister held that the cherty of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of his monetary policy board, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate steps," suggesting that no additional monetary flexibility was to wait Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issue institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates rise, the Scholarships flanked
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Scholarships are getting a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10h, CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yielded 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on debt yields from euro area states in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears of market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has an eye on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10: 00, the European currency is worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell back after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds at 10 years of age is 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of the markets, as parliamentary elections in the country take place on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new high history.
Pending euro area growth figures
In the third quarter, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4%, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, brought by household consumption.
However, Insee has downward revised the second quarter, with a 0.1% decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is really the fourth one who is most concerned about economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must outweigh the dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an electoral appointment to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear is holding there.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be overcome in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate deregulation, a missing subject of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
It is not the case of Belgium, which makes its own need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, or of Switzerland, which just wants to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contrasts speech.
Berlin's choice will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a CO2 leap caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Wind European Champion, of which 30% of its electricity is derived, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittence of the wind; therefore, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a pledge for maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the surveys show that.
It is recalled that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative of non-relocalisable jobs.
If France had decided to get out of nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the EUR 6 billion per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a chagrin.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate 60 years while its manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor is there any deabolic source.
Areva's development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a Security Authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power stations as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited with the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgettable human misconduct caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a power station, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a beautiful gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them the free way to take on leadership in the incontournable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of angles - the hugging of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed "human rights country" status.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming at the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers."
But it is only rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a rather broad consensus between left and right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with almost 2 million immigrant workers," and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot host all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by Polish plumbing hordes was shared to both left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity to be granted to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is a banality, indicating that co-development will help to solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electrically paying; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restoring immigration annoys growth and undermines employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants are at risk of replacing national workers, especially low-skilled workers, with downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, most of which are engaged in occupations in areas where there is a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job supply.
A positive effect on wages
As a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase between 0.6% and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization considers that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue less expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to public budgets on average over his or her entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to search for the missing growth points "with the teeth."
The teeth in question, by being used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced during the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be enough, for democracy to be definitively triumph of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way that is.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little," that this was easy to think.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not the sufficient condition for it and can even be made "instrument of oppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are living is an economic crisis, but it is as much and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodia of the true false Greek referendum will have had in this regard a double-revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the troubling feeling of its impossibility, its disagreement.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers no longer shoot in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to demand a succession of national referendums, organized by necessity and in dispersed order.
A white seing with the absolute European monarch or a foot jump attached in the vacuum of the nationalist repli: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want couperets but a common exercise of full right, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that folds with the diktats of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give people's sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to the disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by the socialists and by Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Either.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To do Europe, let's make Europeans.
"Contact-free" chip cards generalize
The World Smart Card Show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), at more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most wealthy segment is that of contact-free technology that allows to pay for public transport or to pay for its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contact-free chip cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for almost 10% of the overall smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region and is earning ground for contact-free payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are smaller: 400.000 Visa-free cards have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the buckles double.
This year Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed themselves to routinely broadcast to their customers bank cards equipped for no contact," said Gérard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally have a real growth next year."
"We are working on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 around the world," says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society, too, said yesterday to prepare for the marketing of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Alger has now "acquired certainty."
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the rapt of two French in Niger last January would have revealed gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by close friends of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past appeals is directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France International (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but more formal evidence must probably be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," a Nigerian researcher, Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months these "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of more complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long seen the group as a community of unbridled illuminates.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haoussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and requires strict respect for the Sharia while its activists commit to the struggle against the unclean central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
The sect will therefore radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
At last Christmas, she claims an attack that causes 80 deaths to Jos, then another to Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram went to the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia, through Nigeria, is now of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, as al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplism and disknowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying foreign policy statements and shortcuts, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsubstantiated - are rotated.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the "Grand Old Party," threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency," a bearer theme in an America exasperated by the migration of whole pans from its industry to Asia.
So much worse if it must involve the triggering of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's ex-ambassador to China and only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled in the face of an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stalls in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
To the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he pissed out. "
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his obligations to this partner.
Contractor Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing misunderstanding of the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy burden in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President replica that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine about anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking him a weak label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been mistaken by military interventions that lead to enlistment.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits more just.
The North Stream, new Russian gas hub in Europe
The North Stream pipeline, which directly links Western Europe to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with glow.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government participated last Tuesday on the edges of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of North Stream, this new pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolitically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte have turned together the steering valve for the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube linking the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklembourg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the time and time completion of this huge site has a great deal of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the heart of the debate, Warsaw had no hesitation to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security in its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a breach between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are highly gas-consuming, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the large smiles displayed by Gazprom leaders, present in numbers at Lubmin at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical exploit.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-gained steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred had to be abducted or destroyed by precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for North Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project leaders renounced it while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds for a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of one metre in diameter, and is pushed by gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, he gives precise information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of the gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each), were joined.
These five companies have established a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this company, for 20 years renewable, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas actually carried," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment was 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that happens before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas at every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
He has a perfume of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, broken white leaves, as old by time.
Yet the Moleskine book as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished note book.
Maria Sebregondi, then company consultant, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an old production technique, the mole skin (mole skin) which means a varnish cotton used to cover banquettes for example.
This type of book was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has given the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million elapsed coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a buyer's portrait-robot, because the note book seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In Moleskine's image, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early years, had almost 100 employees today and had two offices since 2008: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the growth of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists show their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and of this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand has a wide range of media.
A success that made a lot of trouble: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was repurchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disgusting?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, "the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities."
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities there are still many obstacles before they have access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bac and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for persons with disabilities, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all these criteria make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and are "the node of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
This is for objective brakes.
It remains the unsaid, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability," with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchair, psychiatric or intellectual disabilities."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of workers with disabilities, as set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," says Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20-49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100-199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before confronting the Bleus Tuesday night (8: 45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game gives them.
We will not go until we write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the estrade of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his attacker's motive gesture against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only commendations to make about it.
"I am very happy with Eden, with his progress and with his being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and selection services, "it is a whole," he justified himself. "
"In Lille, I am there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Ménagé contre la Roumanie vendredi soir pour ce match contre la France, Hazard vient à Saint-Denis pour enfin "briller."
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure."
The Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been in support," he says.
Fortunately, this helps to further strengthen the "particular" character of this meeting.
As far as the face is concerned, "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"We met earlier."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, referred to "pride."
"pride" to fight "a gala game."
"pride" also to see - as "neighbor" - that France "has become a very high-level team" just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a thunder work," he enthusiasts.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well shared with the Bleus direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be aware of it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal is beginning with great optimism its dam back to Bosnia (10: 00 p.m.), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
When we went, both teams had failed realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in the mantle since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to go through.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than an hour, of course, but it has been unable to mark this so precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not scored a goal outside"
But at home, in their bright Luz Stade in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be so boiling there, even if the party is obviously "very tight," dixit a Bento optimist but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chances of being at the Euro 2012," however relativised Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The null reported on Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
A null can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not scored a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention to put a maximum of pressure on the Bosnians from entry in order not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided we are realistic this time.
