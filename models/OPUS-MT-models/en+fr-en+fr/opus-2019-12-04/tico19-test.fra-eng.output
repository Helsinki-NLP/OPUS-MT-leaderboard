Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with COVID-19 in need of care, in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control referred to the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In about 14% of cases, VIOC-19 is more severe in need of hospitalization, while the remaining 6% are developing a serious form of disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to VIOC-19 is about 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) and in the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of the Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
After China, CISG-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the CISG-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that CISG-19 is a pandemic.
In the 5 March Eurosurveillance 2020 edition, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Cumulative number and cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08: 00.
These data were used to assess developments in the EU / EEA-19 and in the United Kingdom, and to compare with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence at 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8: 00 a.m. at 15 March 2020 with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Developments in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The trend in the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed that of Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This has been mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of CISG-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8: 00, 15 other EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU / EEA and in the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of CISG-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purposes of COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors from affected regions in Italy indicated that about 10 per cent of patients with VIOC-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and / or in intensive care are currently available at EU / EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU / EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk & gt; 90% of overcapacity for intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid CEPCM risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since cases were so far grouped in some regions of the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU / EEA and in the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as well as an increase in the number of patients with VIOC-19 in need of care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a containment approach to an mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also reflects public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without this, it is likely that health systems in other EU / EEA countries will have to face a peak of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like his counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable, and affects older people than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research subject.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has always marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the whole of the gold week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV), which resulted in an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before extending to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, VIOC-19 is "the number one public enemy," potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this growing new subject.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and will address certain issues still pending but yet urgent.
Coronavirus is traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common rhumes 4.
However, during this century we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading quickly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third episode of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig. 1.1, then-unknown pneumonia homes were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that inter-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed in quarantine with an interruption of all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2) .2).
To the extent that the situation is changing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of any age, but more predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31 / 100,000) than women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the Hubei province and outskirts.
The average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive movements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genres: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, coronavirus known to infect Man belonging to the alpha and beta genres.
The Spike (S) glycoprotein of the envelope is linked to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been established to be a new type of beetacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electronic microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b as well as a secretated protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known domains or functional motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 to a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the middle host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to Man via veggies and celebrids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronavirus from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect Man remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., expressed the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve a homologue recombination within the S. protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-mushed mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, based on 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a difference of importance; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may well have similar properties.
It would appear that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally without immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) .4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through the molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLR), NOD type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I type receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation and synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytose of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T CD4 + and CD8 + cells, play an important role in defence.
T CD4 + cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies of the virus, and T CD8 + cells directly eliminate infected cells.
The help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by induce their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which may result in serious lesions to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a household appearance, is more likely to affect the elderly with comorbidity and pregnant women.
It is commonly recognized that people exposed to large numbers of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
It is estimated that the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days for a range of 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demography of 8.866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of the quarantine after a period of incubation as precise as possible, in order to prevent people infected but asymptomatic from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to or infected with the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, scratch, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, thoracic pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have had dyspnoea and / or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiography abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings were reported by two recent studies on a family and a home that emerged following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than those with COVID-19, which is consistent with higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
With respect to SARS, it was established that the main symptoms were fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnoea (40% -42%), diarrhoea (20% -25%) and throat disease (13% -25%), and that ventilatory assistance was needed for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As at 14 February, the mortality of the IVIC-19 was 2 per cent, for 66,576 cases confirmed globally.
Comparatively, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographics study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a rally or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carrying the virus without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that re-reinstated patients may be carrying the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the time of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white cells & lt; 4 × 109 / L and a number of lymphocytes & lt; 1 × 109 / L, as well as high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia have been identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had higher levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytic sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimer rate, a fibrin degradation product in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
There are thoracic radiography abnormalities in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by unequal bilateral shadows or depolated glass opacity at the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRs).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gaseous exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the most worrying thoracic examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membranes formation, interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and the presence of mucous syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical events began to be used for diagnosis (which then was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for SARS diagnosis.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical events, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol / L and 200 × 10-18 mol / L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive bandwidth in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support for patients with VIOC-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2) .2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, re-established patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even reinstated patient plasma has been proposed for treatment purposes.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly on lungs in the first instance and probably to a lesser extent also other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, malfunction and respiratory impairment are the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
For example, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxidogentherapy, high-flow oxidogentherapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporelle membrane oxidation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary deflection technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that an excessive reaction of the immune system results in cytokinic shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, particularly in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they would result in serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids was recommended for patients with severe forms of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous rehab administration, a nucleosidic analogue, has proved effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
The cure is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, the rehab also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin were further developed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver lesions and other side effects may occur following combination treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients restored and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have healed a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Reinstated patients often have relatively high antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had healed COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of immune response and potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat serious patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
As a result, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes coding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components into a formula that varies according to the diagnosis, based on the theories of the MTC.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or not at all, as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their best associations.
At present, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, CTM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of disease.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have proved to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of CVID-19 healing were observed in the Chinese provinces that used CTM for 87% of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only 30% of patients with CVID-19, had the lowest rate of healing (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study that compared treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and combined treatment involving MO and MTC.
It was found that the time for return to normal body temperature, the time for symptoms to disappear and the time for hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); also, mortality was lower for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through controlled testing at a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally deeply concerned about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, solitude and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may result in increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidity was reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional condition and even suicidal trends.
Mandatory contact search and quarantine, as part of the public health services response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma of their family and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, persons in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal tanks and human beings to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and / or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly people and in models subject to lethal provocation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection are still to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS was extinguished 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic MERS cases and homes continue to be reported in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various immunization strategies for MERS were developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some were evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the long time (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic coronavirus variations.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are gradually reinstated without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to experience underlying comorbidity and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: patients with VIOC-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may result in hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are highly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, treatment response and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the CPVD-19 prognosis was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also be used to establish prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue lesions.
As a result, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of thoracic radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
As high-dose corticosteroids were widely used for serious SARS cases, many survivors had avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of the infection, like coronavirus at the origin of common rhumes.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously ill patients with very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the fall phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., consider that VIOC-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., have established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and have concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the samples of the medium nasal cornet and the regained patient throat, 2 weeks after their release from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
The Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiosity to finally extinguish or that it evolves into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in saddles, unveiling a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
This means taking precautionary measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even any person who is likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respirator masks N95 (1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of fully penetrating; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
As the particles are able to cross five surgical masks stacked on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor proved to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body by the eye due to inflammation.
As a result, health care professionals must also wear transparent viewers or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre with the patients.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in a high state of alert after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was uncontagious, had limited interhuman communicability, and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a significant release, particularly at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
The Chinese disease control agencies must learn from it and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports of doctors or official organizations; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than attempt to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the social response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it extended to all of China as well as to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an already seen impression.
However, there are significant differences between VIOC-19 and SARS, which should be considered in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also greater among older persons.
SARS has higher mortality than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, re-established patients may be positive to the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress of research on CISG-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronavirus from bats, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example bats, to Man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupt transmission effectively, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly in respiratory cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also lie to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to obtain answers to all these questions as well as to many others.
However, no matter what expenditure this must cause, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for both viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first SARS case dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
In addition to super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases with a incubation period between 4 and 7 days, with the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, flawed liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in the event of SARS suspiçion.
diffused alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been made in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunodepressed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjonctivite, fever and bronchiolite is common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Usually, when these HCoV acquire the ability to communicate effectively and to keep themselves on a continuous basis in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical events of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by an acute evolutionary pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal known viruses in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more communicable than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoV showed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCoV.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoV (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoV that cause moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
From this perspective, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more infected people are, the more likely the virus is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it fits well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired VOCs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the four HCoV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without host animal reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoV's evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediary and amplifier hosts.
An animal is used as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a close ascendant sharing an homology high at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus has often been well adapted and is non-pathogenic for its host.
In the same way, a reservoir host houses HCoV on an ongoing and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as an intermediate amplifier host cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive to SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The angiotensin conversion enzyme human 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromadaries are HIV-positive to specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal means, which is also the main way of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than that between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could be derived from bat coV, while parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another Bat CoV, called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, detected in Ghana, while celebrids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the bat close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpagas.
Then, HCoV-related alpha-CoV-229E-related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaga alpha-CoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaga alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the bat serves as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpagas and dromadaires could serve as an intermediate host transmitting viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission from bats to dromadaries and dromadaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known by its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromadaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have moved from intermediate host to stable natural tank hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through peeling or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifiers to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans are contracting the virus through the peeling and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared with other single-strand RNA viruses, estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~ 10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the adaptation phase of VOC to new hosts.
However, VOC mutation rates are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the transfer rate is often high when the VOCs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromadaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Thirdly, VOCs are randomly and frequently changing models when replicating the RNA through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal coV, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S protein unit S1 means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been affected.
An electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S. protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoirs hosts, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: back to the starting box
The diversity of bats' coV offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this sense, bat VOCs are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Among the associated proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, given that SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This scinds ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressentied as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced recombination episodes between different lines, which occurred in dromadaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure in their host reservoir.
asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coV strains may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a chance that three new HCoV have appeared over the past two decades.
VOCs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoir such as bats and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of CoV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 flammasome is deficient in bats.
In following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 flammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV came back under the fires of the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromadaire for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coV circulate in nature.
In particular, the Bat VOCs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between man and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been available on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-man transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted by failing to wash hands before touching eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous mucosa).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap hand washing.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is almost 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of almost 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hand level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Overly common hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
The deparasitage twice a year, associated with daily soap hand washing and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleaner since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants is a means of targeting antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). A rigorous analysis of the Oregon University Public Health School indicated that common soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm and savoury water is more effective than cold and savoury water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of clean water does not contribute to reducing microbial load on hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a humectant such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and / or skin hydrants.
The dry effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and / or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin drought than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic materials on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of disinfectants for alcohol-free hands is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Cendre or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the earth or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of curbing it.
Like soap, the ash is also a disinfectant because in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Write your hands with warm or cold running water.
Routine water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Mix a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frotter creates friction, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and frotter longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundant with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Wet and wet hands recontaminate more easily. The most often forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and undernails.
Artificial nails and sliced nail varnish can accommodate microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dermal droughts promote the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash hands when tap water and / or soap are not available. For example, drain water from a stunned and pierced bidon or gourd and / or use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crush using a rope, and a pedal that allows a small amount of water to be placed on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is debating.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
After hand washing and drying with hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the pulp of the fingers and by 254% on the eyelids.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectants is an alternative solution during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical wash of the hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to wet and froze each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if applicable).
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood / biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of the washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Hand-washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to foment behavioural developments. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand-washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetish odours called miasmes.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" have been placed next to sparks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice of something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification," such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash hands before and after each meal.

because it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are most likely due to the pressure exerted during selection, particularly by the host immune system.
One example is the loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaga alpha-CoV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure in their host reservoir.
asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that the bats had adapted well to the VOCs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural tuous cells in bats is removed by positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural tuous cells NKG2 / CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the molecules of the major class I. histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coV strains may also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not a chance that three new HCoV have appeared over the past two decades.
VOCs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their host reservoir such as bats and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes severe infections in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung lesions are.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was cut off from the replication of CoV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 flammasome is deficient in bats.
In following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 flammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat coV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While weed and other animals on the market have been discovered as virus carriers identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been designed by man, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoV came back under the fires of the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of VOCs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the bat and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is derived from contact between humans and weed in the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of weed in them could have effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolins and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromadaire for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coV circulate in nature.
In particular, the Bat VOCs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There are opportunities for these zoonotic VOCs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more communicable and / or fatal VOCs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between man and animals.
In view of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been available on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many positive characteristics for virus diffusion, the probability for humans of being in contact with bats and other wildlife may be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-man transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
We do not yet know all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see in what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we should determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolving pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of VIOC-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the Diagnostic and Treatment of New Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic at the global level.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, with our knowledge and knowledge gradually progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of VIOC-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to VIOC-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has received much attention since her publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /) had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which had been substantially modified.
As we received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must involve one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical events to form a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical events in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where there have been reported cases of COVID-19 (with a positive test of nucleic acids) in the last 14 weeks, or in a reduced area of contact (in the previous 2 weeks).
Clinical events: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with VIOC-19 characteristics; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the whole viral genome with strong homogeneity to known new coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for IgM and IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive to or increased title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third edition (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with respect to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
As a result, Zhou et al. 's graphic representation should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to comment.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to VIOC-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country has a record of HIV-related mortality in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 healed persons, who remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was due to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still allowed.
On 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the confinement of the city until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Zoonotic origin of human coronavirus
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoV come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate tank hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host-coV interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of coV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genus of Bêta-CoV contains the majority of HCoV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoV (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracing of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the host (s), intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications for the prevention of future contagions.
Animal VOCs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoV have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with higher respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate climate countries.
Magasins in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, the Australian shop chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Buyers apparently raised reserves because of fear of VIOC-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock break in the hour following delivery," and described the request as "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, described it as "unexpected."
Sales grew "sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made available stocks earlier for a planned promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult to do so.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and less promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honour the promotion of Wednesday.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores resupply stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous item, leading to stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will probably reduce panic," said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were in stock break.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent paper, pointed out that they are working 24 / 7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au. article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder during auctions in Melbourne, while less auction sales were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page encart to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were first reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization qualifies COVID-19 as a pandemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the dangerosity of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to push governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are overcoming, testing, treating, isolating, localizing and mobilizing their populations as part of the response, "said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's Director General.
"We are very concerned not only about alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He stated, in comments published by CNN in February, that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed from its appearance to its continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the decision of WHO in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The Director of the United States National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said in relation to the epidemic: "To make the situation short, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, having resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, leading to approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The lethal rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and stiffness.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it may oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and support therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering mouth to coughing, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have reacted by putting in place restrictions on travel, quarantaines, curfew, workplace risk controls and institutional closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed down nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Fake information about the virus has been circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported an outbreak of cases of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so it is believed that the virus would be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus of pangolins, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person who had experienced symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear connection to the subsequent home of the fresh product market.
On the cases of the first home reported in December 2019, two thirds of them proved to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, with a 55-year-old in Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be declining in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before they could reach effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of persons who have been tested at VIOC-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only blessed symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated at 86 per cent, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79 per cent of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VIOC-19 are healing.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to CISG-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the IUOC-19 pandemic generally refer to those who were tested positive to IUU according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VIOC-19 may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in pension homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the figures for overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the deaths of VIOC.
A spokesperson for the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of underevaluation in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine epidemic. The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been registered in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the world case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-death ratio decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms that appeared between January 1 and 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms that appeared after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the rate of lethality (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who suck to a disease, and the rate of infection (infection rate), which represents the percentage of contaminated (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who suck to a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall rate of infection for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on the lethal rate estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Without control, infectious epidemics generally stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen. "
The Chief Medical Advisor of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries are able to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to curb the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for one or two years."
According to an Imperial College study by Neil Ferguson, physical distanciation and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus - because it is very easily transmitted - will disappear completely" and that it "could become a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes rather non-specific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosity), loss of odorate, stiffness, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has respiratory difficulties.
The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as persistent respiratory difficulty, pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and blue face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent evolution of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, then researchers have made recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio vary from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and the onset of symptoms) oscillates between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost odorate was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spread remains to be determined.
The disease is assumed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air over longer periods of time, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during expiry, particularly by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Potillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people located next door or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and thus cause aerial spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for disease up to three days before symptoms suggest transmission is possible before significant symptoms are developed.
Only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly what ease the disease is spreading, one person in general contamines two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the British authorities recommend washing their hands after having touched animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the home of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in coronavirus related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the Betacoronavirus genus, the Sarbecovirus subgenus (line B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another sample of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and human viruses.
The comparison of the genome as a whole has so far revealed a maximum of 92% of the common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase (rRT-PCR) chain reaction of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is much more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner is not used to detect or as a first-purpose test to diagnose COVID-19."
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test may be carried out on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a few hours or days.
In general, this test is carried out on a rhinopharynx sampling, but it is also possible to use a throat sampling. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on the radiographs and tomodensitometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral depoli glass opacity and lack of pleural development.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is of limited precision to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners with PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurons networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imaging both on radiographs and scanners.
The prevention strategies for disease transmission include overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who have already been contaminated have been recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distanciation measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have prohibited or disadvised all non-essential displacement to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spread into communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health professionals who care for someone who could be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. The search for contact is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone localization data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communiqué calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of volunteerism, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at COVID-19. Fake ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinse your nose and gargarize with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against VIOC-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crèche, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or a handkerchief when they touch or sneeze, and to throw all handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected postillons by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Porter a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene." The use of mask has also been advocated for those who care for a person who is potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended that mask be worn to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example, if they care for a patient with VIOC-19, even if it recognizes that mask wear can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or bonded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to manufacture facial masks at home and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public exits without mask or other means to cover its nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the port of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect himself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that any person entering a supermarket should wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million mask per day since mid-March, imposed the mask on long distance train and bus passengers on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distanciation (also known as physical distanciation) includes infection control measures to slow down the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
The methods include quarantaines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
Social distance methods can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, salutating without contact and keeping physical distance with others.
Many Governments are now ordering or recommending social distanciation in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum level of gatherings recommended by United States government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious disease and complications, thus being invited by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health care agencies began to replace the term "social distanciation" with "physical distanciation," to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by either maintaining a virtual distance or by maintaining social links.
The use of the term "social distanciation" suggested that full social isolation should be used rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom we live, who does not have the virus or who does not present the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people who were diagnosed with VIOC-19 and those who thought they were infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a patient with VIOC-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Epidemiology control strategies are endigument or suppression, and mitigation.
The endigument is in place during the early stages of the epidemic and is aimed at monitoring and isolating infected people, as well as introducing other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are being made towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Conditioning and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures to inflate the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an epidemic of infectious disease is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called brightening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload of health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, mask wear and individual quarantine; public social distanciation measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public effort to encourage and participate in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning; more drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China when the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantine of whole cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and sanctioned the grabbing of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (overturning the development of the epidemic) face important challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2 / 3 and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Removal may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), as if not, transmission quickly bounces when measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VIOC-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatment tests.
The taking of medicines without a prescription against cold or drink consumption as well as rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on gravity, oxidogentherapy, intravenous perfusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with CISG-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for the redeployment of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to VIOC-19 tests, by cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, by separating and isolating patients who are positive at VIOC-19, and by strengthening intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital in Hubei province, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway link.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by posting the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died and over 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted movement and set up border controls.
National reactions included containment measures such as quarantine (also called home-based orders, on-site shelter or containment) and curfew. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to containment in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world had a form of confinement, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later - about one third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would date back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of cases of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, and she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "spreading rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine of human history," a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles has been prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was subsequently built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Day leave.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been dealing with one form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the world phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country within the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.

A CNN report indicated that the combination between the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distanciation or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its clear lack of reactivity and vitality in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, disadvising all non-essential social travel and contact, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment rooms.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and sports rooms should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries, within a limit of £2,500 per month, to avoid unemployment due to the crisis.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that even though it was "certainly not a recommendation from WHO," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it was most concentrated" and he spoke of a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of an inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO has stated that the epidemic was an emergency of public health in the PUSA since the sixth phase of the PPI.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, particularly for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "There is no reason why measures unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support strategic preparation in low-income countries, invoking the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the systems necessary to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to emerge."
Tedros then stated that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On 11 February, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "strength of the entire United Nations system into the response."
A United Nations crisis management team was therefore activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO was activated in China to dispatch international experts and WHO to China to support national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," indicating that it is well that it is too early to talk about each country, "however, in preparation."
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team on site to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global coronavirus threat assessment had increased from "high" to "very high," its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you have to stand ready, "adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid" the worst. "
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "extremely concerned at both alarming levels of spread and severity and at alarming levels of inaction." WHO has faced significant criticism about its management of the pandemic, which is considered inadequate, particularly because of the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition that incited the Director General of WHO Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for each individual's rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief assistance and that this responsibility was the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the UNMOVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and displacement restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge of coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of the firm Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial directors of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were removed from their duties following their management of the quarantine in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of policy makers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic had begun in Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The American administration of Donald Trump described coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," stating that in China "censorship has overfed a virus that has become a global pandemic," which was then taxed with racism by some opponents and intended to "divert attention from its administration's inability to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast has obtained a telegram from the US government outlining the lines of a communication strategy apparently from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in all possible ways, including at press conferences and television appearances. "Press bodies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push to gain influence at the global level.
EU Foreign Policy Leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and" generosity policy. ""
Borrell also stated that "China strongly insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid to the latter two countries a priori.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own countries.
Other masks-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity. "
On 22 March, following a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high political source" which indicated that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "little or no use for Italy."
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft to the United States for medical aid.
The spokesperson for Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] is based on the principle that when American manufacturers of equipment and medical equipment have gained speed, they will be able to make them the same if necessary."
The extent of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 infected members of parliament, as well as 15 other old or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, stating that his country had difficulty in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic had raised calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health financing.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for the indictment of Moon for the mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or on the contrary praising its reaction. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree until further notice, to suspend the parliament and the elections and to punish anyone who would be accused of having spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply breaks, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases, and disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency issued warnings about drug and medical equipment shortages due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also been confronted with panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of basic necessity products, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, and shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide and WHO is warning that this will endanger health professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigous people to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been planned in Europe and North America.
As a result of its large agricultural production, Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government unlocked pork reserves to ensure sufficient subsistence for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the world economy have been felt in China: according to a media report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, it has been found that the viral epidemic is a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit planned that the markets would remain unstable until a clearer image emerges on potential exits.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
The estimate of an expert from Washington University of Saint-Louis reported an impact of over $300 billion on the global logistics chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have "blurred" after a sharp decrease in oil prices due to the decline in demand in China.

Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe has bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several ferry stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the prohibited City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted at the global level, with discounts in shop opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, merchants saw a decrease of 50-60%.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in malls in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America as compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, much of the some 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves blocked in domestic provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for assistance from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Insertion in India has left tens of millions of migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute's survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900 000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies had their employees shifted to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and to different degrees, museums, libraries, entertainment rooms and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or carried over.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which take place the last week of the Lent Christian penance period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes rather than attend Sunday messes; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online, live or television while others offer to practice their worship as "drive-in."
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels, and the St. Peter's Square, which has taken away all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest break in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH 2019-20 season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to register online, and many online game sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new enrollments. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many great theatres, such as those in Broadway, also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to produce, disseminate and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet meems on the theme of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humour and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a rise in prejudices, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports dated February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of the inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese people, whether online or off-line, and to people in areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, the inhabitants of the first European country to suffer a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed petitions to prohibit Chinese entry into their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan made a run on Twitter.
The Chinese and other Asian people living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
American President Donald Trump faced criticism for having described coronavirus as "Chinese virus," a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuates between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the West Bengal unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took his revenge on them."
The comments were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which qualifies them as "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people were abducted by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated."
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free-access epidemic.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and antibody produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA only.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those with symptoms too light to be reported or asymptomatic people.
An exact rate of disease mortality and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethal rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including nasopharyngeal skeleton or expectoration sample.
Results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal squirrels is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat while it continues its multiplication in the lungs.
In those infected in the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by suction catheter, or a crush (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with a reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerisation reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive an emergency-use authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Authority for a PCRR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real time to the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-ConV) laboratories through the Reagent International Health Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained unconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottlenecks in the Atlanta CDC tests. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were federal and local laboratories authorized to start screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authority. The United States commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of national-level COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed national COVID-19 tests on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test for VIOC-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics was authorized by the FDA for a test that could be carried out in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing an aircraft to conduct approximately 4.128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses the insulated amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that "pulmonary radiographs have low diagnostic value in early stages, while TDM [tomodensitometry] results can be conclusive even before symptoms arise."
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are multi-lobar bilateral depoli glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and postterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation are developing as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR with TDM at Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the TDM be not used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance. Tests may be conducted in central laboratories (TLC) or by patient's knight test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated broadband systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of conducting these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analyse.On March 26, 2020, FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and which, therefore, are now able to distribute their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an authorization to use urgence.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan in which suspicious cases can stay at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, send it back and later receive the test result. British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use. In the drive-test of COVID-19 for suspicious cases, a health professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres allowed South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive checks in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study found that by calendar week 12 / 2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12 / 2020 included, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a sample analysis method for 64 patients at a time, by grouping the samples and by conducting the screening only if the combined sample is positive.In Wuhan, an improvised laboratory for emergency detection of 2,000 squares called "Huo-Yan" in February 2020, "in the course of which the first two months of February of the year of the year, the year of the year of the year, was opened.
With its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, BGI's founder, the modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without a liquid handling robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue the screening. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now the country testing most of its per capita population for Coronavirus, and is in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of drive-testing capacity and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centres for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and screening recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, in large part in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programmes as a best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19.The high demand for testing due to the wide spread of the virus has led to the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of hatchery and chemical reagents have exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, CDC-developed test kits were "flaws." The government then removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing. Spain bought test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will withdraw the kits that gave false results, and will replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased from China 1.2 million test kits that have proved to be failing.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who obtained a positive result and the tracing of people who had been in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death related to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests among the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of people with positive results had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive tracking of contacts, incoming travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has grown much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened at the date scheduled for the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking of contacts, incoming travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more likely to detect people with only light symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and national laboratories have only limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to conduct confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as% of tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only people admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in% of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they present symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at some "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted by failing to wash hands before touching eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous mucosa).
It is important to wash hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's butt or changing his diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after having prepared food or manipulated raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands in the ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
having changed the diapers of a baby or cleaned a child who went to the toilet;
after having wet or coughing / sneezing;
after having touched an animal, feed or waste of animal origin;
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Wash hands before giving drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a study conducted in 2013, the improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as soap hand washing.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhoea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by providing drinking water to low-income regions.
Snow-washing allows for 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which is almost 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the death of almost 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce by almost half diarrhoea deaths and by a quarter deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally associated with other health measures under the water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hand level, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Overly common hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defecation), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after having prepared food or manipulated raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be cleaned properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after having treated a cut or injury, after having sneezed, coughed or wet, after having touched animal waste or manipulated animals, and after having touched garbage.
In many countries, the soap hand cleaning rate is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 from 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average washed their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%). There are now several methods to change the behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at the key times of the day. It is possible, in particular, in developing countries, to propose to the children in the middle of the day to use of a group.
For example, the Ministry of Education of Philipinne has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote child health and education.
The deparasitage twice a year, associated with daily soap hand washing and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms on the skin, soap or detergents should be added to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleaner since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
Adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still states that "liquid soap automatic distributors are preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants is a means of targeting antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). A rigorous analysis of the Oregon University Public Health School indicated that common soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm and savoury water is more effective than cold and savoury water to eliminate natural oils with dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of clean water does not contribute to reducing microbial load on hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early twenty-first century, non-aqueous alcohol-based hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or to a humectant such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the dry effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (3.5% reduction, log equivalent to a 35 decimal reduction) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 log reduction) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to properly wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and interstices between fingers and nails should be fronted for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless you have water and soap at hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and / or skin hydrants.
The dry effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and / or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients have caused significantly less irritation and skin drought than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatites made them more attractive than hand washing with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate organic materials on their hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The efficacy of disinfectants for alcohol-free hands is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have had a long-term and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is mitigated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many have no means of buying soap, and rather use ash or land.
Cendre or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the earth or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of curbing it.
Like soap, the ash is also a disinfectant because in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Write your hands with warm or cold running water.
Routine water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not seem to make any difference).
Mix a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frotter creates friction, which helps to remove the germs of the skin, and frotter longer removes more germs.
Rinse abundant with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant water basin can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Wet and wet hands recontaminate more easily. The most often forgotten areas are thumb, wrist, spaces between fingers and undernails.
Artificial nails and sliced nail varnish can accommodate microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dermal droughts promote the emergence of skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many economic alternatives to wash hands when tap water and / or soap are not available. For example, drain water from a stunned and pierced bidon or gourd and / or use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "tippy-taps" and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crush using a rope, and a pedal that allows a small amount of water to be placed on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is debating.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilet.
In 2008, a study funded by the wipe-all paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After hand washing and drying with hot air dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the pulp of the fingers and by 254% on the eyelids.
Air-jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the fingers pulp and up to 77% on the eyes.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other users of the toilet and the toilet environment based on each drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which blows air out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the aircraft and possibly contaminate other users of the toilet as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows for the dissemination of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
The paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectants is an alternative solution during displacement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical wash of the hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to wet and froze each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if applicable).
This allows you to avoid recontaminating your hands in contact with the surfaces.
The objective of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient level of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce blood-related catheters by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization can also be found on the website for feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Trade-available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" on hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood / biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("drug" or "antimicrobial" soap) provides the hand-washing agent with an action of germ destruction.
It is desirable to remove these germs before making a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very widespread. To "froze" hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a chlorhexidine-based washing product or iodine, sterile towels to dry their hands after washing them, a sterile brush to froze and another sterile instrument to clean under nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub hands for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once your hands are washed, your hands should be dried with a sterile linen and a surgical casack should be buried.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained in the first 20% of the washing, and that there were only very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
By comparing hand washing with an ordinary soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the first has reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A (H1N1) virus and hard Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders about this.
Further research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered an inexpensive and essential tool to preserve health and even feed properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal habits of hand hygiene.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to tenacious habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap-washing and raising awareness can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of this practice and lead to long-term change in behaviour in the population.
In order for this approach to take place, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective; with regard to the promotion of hand washing in schools, the example of the UNICEF Three-Star Approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules, is given.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand hygiene that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Hand-washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to foment behavioural developments. Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand-washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e., DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fetish odours called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The emergence of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" have been placed next to sparks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice of something.
It comes from a biblical verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she committed and that she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering acts contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification," such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the rituals of hand washing put forward in many religions, including Bahuhism and Hindu, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands for certain purposes, in particular after-use.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk controls at work
The risk controls of COVID-19 at the workplace refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to VOCD-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower risk of exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, breathing labels, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density working environments and some large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health workers and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, to be at very high risk if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or manipulation of samples of persons with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and task-appropriate personal protective equipment.
VOCD-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, must take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with respect to the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from areas severely affected by VIOC-19 may be discontinued. A plan for the preparation and response of infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic diseases.
They also outline the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the applied responses.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms an overall framework used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to be based on workers' behaviour; they can be the most cost-effective solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly adapted as required (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically carried, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or scrapped to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering the mouth and nose to coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchips and trash, preparing for telework or at time of work as required, the deterrence of workers to use the tools and equipment of others, and the maintenance of routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have no longer had fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other symptoms-acting drugs. They also recommend that they apply flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without suspected or known COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to an ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person recently made an international trip to a region with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, in particular in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for the customer service. The administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk of personal safety include the encouragement of the patient to remain in the home by means of virtual communications, the establishment of a safety-related safety-care system and the provision of a safety-care system for workers, including the provision of a safety-free-of-duty-of-duty-of-duty-duty workers, and-duty-duty-to-duty-duty-to-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-to-to-duty-duty-duty-to-duty ,-duty-duty-duty-to-duty ,-duty-duty-to-duty-duty-to-duty-duty-duty-to-duty-duty ,-duty-duty-duty-duty-to-duty-to-duty-duty ,-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-to-to-duty-duty-duty-to-duty-to-duty ,-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-@-@ duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-to-to-to-duty-duty-duty-duty-duty-@-@ duty-duty-duty-duty-@-@-@-@-@-@ duty-duty-duty-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from the other by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of handkerchiefs when he or she couches or eternates.
The cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Gants and other disposable items must be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise and other passenger vessels, risk controls include deferral of the trip in the event of a disease as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must take place in the single person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimum to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outlets, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir or canteen meals, by increasing space between offices, by phasing out time of arrival and exit, by reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distanciation strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement personnel who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulanciers, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service ceinturon before re-use using a wipe or a household detergent spray and follow the standard procedures for containment and scrapping of used EPI as well as for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become very high-risk workers if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or take or manipulate patient samples with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they are autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when conducting aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
Samples should be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating incoming patients into separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPI, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons working within 6 feet of patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those conducting aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 or higher NIOSH-approved respiratory filtration masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends that a surgical mask be worn only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial screen, a blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedures, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to persons directly involved in its care, the use of EPI necessary for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of EPI, and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our overall human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and community-building at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The comrade and benevolence we have observed between all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to have you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be a response tailored to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the organization's viability during this period.
We wanted first of all to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at present, and if you need to take care of your relatives, to race or to consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick stop or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team revise time schedules and jobs to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you are diagnosed as positive at VIVID-19, please notify Bryan of the T & amp; C Ops Department for T & amp; C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
Hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues in the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours carried out under normal conditions.
It's worth it if you're sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating their stress from the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Confidence & amp; Security and Fund-raising teams (among others) are doing an essential job that may need backup.
We will start a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as much to catch up with the lost time" when the pandemic has passed.
We will not ask you to do overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will try to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about PPA (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new reality and day-to-day working time targets, we plan to adjust the timeline for delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, care for them and their relatives while adapting to those who need or wish to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of time limits significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will inform delegates and teams about the next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office situation, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco might have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, in excess of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital quality to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork room, which shared with us and all the staff members based in Washington DC its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a local in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Define the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage online collaboration and exchange.
Provide a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for snacks.
Join # remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is exploring webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimédia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our applications for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week we will issue additional directives on Wikimania and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general sense of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of upheaval and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
With respect to the follow-up, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to VIOC-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This is all about us and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information at the same location.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff members living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison where appropriate.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be considered as an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of acknowledging that at present our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help they need, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our planned work will be there to wait for us in the right time.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps in the months to come.
We need each of you to do this, so you have to preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself in the right time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and don't touch your face!

B'L'enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE) activity by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a N-end peptidase M2 domain and a C-end renal amino acid-bearing collectrine domain.
ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein of type I, whose enzyme active field is exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is clived from the transmembranary domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood flow and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly from cells of type II pulmonary alveoles, enterocytes of the hail intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 RNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and cerebral trunk.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate for the ACE.
The ACE clives angiotensin hormone I into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ACE2 clives angiotensin carboxyl amino acid (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and vasodilatant angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also click several other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinine, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphin A, and ghreline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranar protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in cells of certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the VOCD-19 virus).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV spicule S1 protein and SARS-CoV2 to ACE2 enzyme domains at cell surface results in both endocytose and translocation of both virus and enzyme into endosomes within cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended that standard treatment be continued using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitor who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those who were victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less likely than for the overall risk of pneumonia. "
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is pressentious as an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hematinamic and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the action time is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect duration (duration).
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (SRA) or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. rhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, that is, the identification of people ("contacts") who may be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructure has been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, in particular those based on tracing the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application to China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it was provided in open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!," a Bluetooth application to track exposure to potentially infected people and to communicate quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technologies and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geotracking application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, referred to several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positive systems and the lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trusted organisms to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat has been removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set out eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrated;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any data sharing with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protections against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google / Apple aims to address the problem of continuing surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, the network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server-based systems need access to personal localization data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system has been used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracing information from various sources, including data tracing mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the Government has also made localization information accessible to the public, which was authorized as a result of the profound changes to the privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in this country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been provided on April 6, 2020.
The tracing of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data from 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT / DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all correspondence is made on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally based at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure material technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the BlueTrace Protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a privacy-based cryptography.
They also published the basic technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracing applications
direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates of the operating system and by later removing it in the same way once the threat has been removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also referred to as reorientation, reprofiling, reallocation or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the reconversion of an approved drug for a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against CISG-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of plasma from convalescent people. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligands binding sites.
The analysis of these liaison sites provides a realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, dependent RNA polymerase, hélicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al., studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain self-immune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State tests for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians reported using this medicine "when there are no other options."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to give birth.
A study of lopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra), an association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed."
These drugs have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by linking to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to change these drugs to find a compound that would be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specially developed for HIV / AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir / ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
The remevir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that the remevir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that rehab may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on people with moderate pathology and the other on those with more serious forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on vitamin C intravenous for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for the alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a Phase II trial is under way with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.

Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Tests are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab # COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many attempts to develop are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
The VIOC-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was reported throughout the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects early in 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets spent in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenoviral vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other advertised, but with little public information available (presumed to be in the course of planning or design).
A Phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and carried out in several centres while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (still in research "preclinical").
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pince vaccine that would genetically change viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to coronavirus through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory research, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that American President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine," which led to the German government's protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a RNA vaccine.
The candidate for BNT162 RNA vaccine is currently in the preclinical test phase with the beginning of clinical trials due in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that she would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of her final vaccine candidate could start in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition pour les innovations en matière de préparation aux épidémies (CEPI) announced an investment of US $4.9 million in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing animals for six different vaccine candidates.
The researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after China sent the sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against VIOC-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that may be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that "the microneedle-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered a significant response of the specific antibody [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a candidate for DNA-based vaccine in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities shared resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they are preventing.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health care professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there are no SARS curative or protective vaccines that have demonstrated both human safety and efficacy.
Research papers published in 2005 and 2006 indicated that the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three other were in progress; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have released a conspiracy theory that the virus at the origin of COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social network publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and stiffness.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but it may oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some are moving towards viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
As these droplets are produced upon expiry, they generally fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than present an infectious risk over long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days following the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and in subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, some authorities disagree with their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, smoothness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties in breathing, persistent pain or chest pressure, confusion, difficulties in walking and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow or throat pain can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially had only thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for VIOC-19 is usually five to six days, but may be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean disease prevention and control centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both expectoration and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loud frees more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors placed in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause aerial spread.
Although there are concerns about saddle spread, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is most contagious when people experience symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms arise, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if we do not yet know exactly what ease the disease is spreading, one person in general contamines two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and eliminates it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia related to the home of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronavirus related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses to host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2), which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplar) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in patients with intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with unfavourable prognosis. The autopsies of deceased people of COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial respiratory cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretive T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngus sampling; however, a nasal or expectoration sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken at two weeks' intervals and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a coronavirus strain and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of chain polymerization (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were being developed but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed a precision of only 60-70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first patient-closest test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobar bilateral depoli glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical, and post-secondary distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar combment) and consolidation may occur with progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresia, pericardite, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of mellitus cells
severe pneumonia: diffus alveolar damage (DAD) with diffus alveolar exsudians.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRM) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia during healing: organization of exsudians in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: spread intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding bonded places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a handkerchief when coughing or eternity and that the inside of the elbow be used in the absence of a handkerchief.
A correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with a fabric in public places to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distanciation strategies are designed to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no medicines known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flashing the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having wet, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for commercial hands are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is not "an antiseptic active substance for the hands."
Glycerol is added as humectant.
People are treated with support care that may include water treatment, oxidogentherapy and support from other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being virus-bearing bear a simple facial mask.
The extracorporelle oxidation by membrane (ECMO) was used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized persons for VIOC-19.
Reanimators and pneumologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for VIOC-19.
With respect to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen at the front line.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially under care conditions when conducting procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who care for people with VIOC-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an air-friendly Isolation Chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPP blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the focus is on respiratory mask (to facial mask).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (AMU).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or as a last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are in the east.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with VIOC-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. There is evidence that intubation can be avoided using a high-speed nasal canule or a positive double-level respiratory pressure.
It is not known whether one or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles relative to a high-speed nasal canule. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak of the number of cases of COVID-19 that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with VIOC-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxidation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of pulmonary injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to start in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
The redeeming seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several drugs under testing are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization to the plasma of convalescent persons as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
He has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate his safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using monitoring data and therefore to detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. The analysis of mass data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and those with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data for people suspected of having coronavirus.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure respect for quarantine and to protect persons who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera said that he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to move."
The German government led a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increased social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection to COVID-19 based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, however, there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can quickly move towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and heart, kidney and liver lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of those in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Commission of Chinese Health (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples have diffused alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exsudes in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Commission of Chinese Health, heart damage due to high troponin levels or heart arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing diseases, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercount of moderate cases may lead to an overassessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are at 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die from non-smokers. Concerns were also expressed about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has seen a 20-30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some healed people of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to an intensive post-healing syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether an earlier infection had an effective long-term immunity in people healed by the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but cases of CVID-19 healed persons followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spread of infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost only led by a transmission of man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO affected the CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths of clinical or epidemiological COVID-19 cases without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The death / case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the world death / case ratio is 6.9% (153,822 / 2,240,191) as at 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited over time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione of Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overridden.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as related to CISG-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest in kinetics, with the difference between men and women only disappearing at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The specific reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and development in men of comorbidity such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from VIOC-19 were men.
In April 2020, the US government did not collect data associated with the genus of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health care personnel, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations for a nomenclature to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "VIOC-19 virus" and "VIOC-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly called "coronavirus."
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as hatches and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency ventilator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup retrodesigned and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, complotist theories, false information and disinformation emerged about origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, is to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on spicle S protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
Seven trials assessed previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on reproach in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine and drug applicants for COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remeneeing, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of the reproach in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate rehab.
Phase III clinical trials are under way in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double this dose is highly dangerous and may be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of VOCD-19 physicians. The 7th edition of the Chinese directives also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against VOCD-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after showing low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serine 2 transmembranar protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock can be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock control properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is in the process of unrandomized phase 2 testing at the national level in Italy after having shown positive results in people with severe forms of disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the cause of the death of some affected people.
The 6-interleukin receptor antagonist was approved by FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of refractory cytokine relargage syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, treatment with CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems of people who have healed COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with little conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example by using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted and died from VIOC-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
