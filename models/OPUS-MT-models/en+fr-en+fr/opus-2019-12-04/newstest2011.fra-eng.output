CSSD does not know Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new members of CSSD at the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely, whether they know the silver that was born in the last years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that led in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague started in the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that new elected people do not fully understand known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Pragoise politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to the culture at the test of the" sponsor "vocabulary.
And as for the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among those you propose to me that I use"
If not, I don't use the money.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congrés of ODS, the editorial has chosen 6 examples, in particular those related to Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the largest golf hole in Prague," go to the patisserie, "" beef nerve, "" betrayal of the capital "and" entailing. "
Three of the elected members agreed for the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek totally refused the test.
"I am not taking care of these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we will understand ourselves in our programs," he reacted.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend that this is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything as Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm gonna have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two social-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the pastry."
"It is, I think, about going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of Janousek's companies.
In the same way, Brezina reminds us that he draws his knowledge rather from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates there is no silver lexicon in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it seems that we really don't have something like that."
"The names are said to be used sometimes," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Socio-Democratic Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," said Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for party members or the least friendly Little old, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones that social-democrats admit to be employed within the party.
It appears that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has registered another nickname for this pragese president.
"Doctor of Matrac Law," it appears that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title as a doctor of law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who are declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has this destiny very rarely."
"Young women are not considered healthy because they are involved in work and give birth to children," said a sister who cares for the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure."
He edited a brochure that should help limit the hunt to witches.
The case has a "hic."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," said Die Standard on the disadvantages of written education.
The charge of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had asperged to her.
The BBC server sent this information.
The criminals say it was the bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual onctions has shattered at the contact of the woman.
The oil flushed, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard cited a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human spirits eaters have always been a danger," he said.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia no later than last year even saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambia President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from close Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal custody of the President, men and women randomly chosen in the villages of Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
On the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The poles are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out by the door of the customer centre of RPG Byty from the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He wore under his arm a case with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2 + 1 second category 4100 kroner apartment.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," shows the finger on his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I still signed," he explained to motive angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of the BytyOKD.cz apartments which described the noodles conditions of rent as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a package leaflet will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by fronting the eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory for deregulation.
After New Year, this is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
RPG's waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 9 am.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and a paper with a number coming out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to light up on the large screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to find out about rent, but new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have been receiving mail with new lease contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
the special shop for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It has been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client shows up as a journalist.
The deragulation and former Bakal minor apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and from the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of social democrats reported that in a rather sustained way before the elections, and it now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put... n board in the wc, relieve in introduction the man mentioned.
However, according to employees, it is above all retirees who come to ensure that they will receive a rebate on the new rent price if they now sign as RPG promised in a special offer.
The other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15 will receive half of the rent amount.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40-50 came for rent," says the employee at the shop.
And yet RPG ports individual rents interviews on its website as well as in the window where necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent it is an independent court that will make the decision.
'This is not a threat, but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way of legally acting, "RPG says on its website.
"Here no one will go to court," thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the client centre is right.
"I have 13,000 kroons of retirement and I have 5,000 kroons left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she says.
Rent regulation in the Czech Republic ends with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for simple maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the repaired armchairs in the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments. "
"And it will always be at least 7.50 Czech kroons per m ² per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a very low amount of 19.66 Czech kroons per m ²," RPG adds.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
Kindergarten is also a part of the office that has included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also be home to a mini-kindergarten with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, can visit the children of Arch. design employees.
The Arch. Design. architectonic project company whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini-corporate kindergarten school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it was important for women architects and project leaders to return to work quickly.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects have the opportunity to combine work with care for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.themselves who imagined this kindergarten school and with the support of management they were able to obtain an staffing from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund through the operational human resources programme and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (up to 2.8 million Czech kroons), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-kindergarten on its own funds.
The project was prepared for one year, and it was Economy rating that helped make the application for staffing.
Care for children is provided by qualified staff, all day long a nurse and kindergarten teacher care for children. Children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they have more than three years for the most part.
As it is a "mini-kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although individual care and education are involved, the mini-kindergarten programme is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not just play it, but quality education is also provided - from the beginning to the preparation for school schools, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of delay to go to a school away from the parents' place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design.has thus registered as one of the companies that offer a prime of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces HR marketing.
The bone house fascins again after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interior.
The toe looks like the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a spine of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish gulls.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of Bone House.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, façade recalling scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliance of the colors is strengthened.
The enroulement and torsion of the shapes also appear in the interior with the same measure.
The wood is a wave copy of the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, eilleton and lamelles.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig merchant street of Gracia at number 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multiple house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for a representation apartment of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaics for the façade were born.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work on Casa Battlo's plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol has been involved in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises overnamed the hot house just after its finishing because of its organic forms "the Bone House."
Others, in view of the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the bypass house."
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems weird.
During the creation of Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of then and did not let themselves be impeded by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the municipal council were not pleased that the pillars of the construction were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase by which you can access an independent roof terrace.
All straight angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space liaison.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the fairs doors and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with wells of lights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark that on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage Fund may be visited by each.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative company and extended the field of visits to common spaces and attic including tooded terraces.
The entry ticket in the monument is really cheap and cost 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and cardholders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a sealant: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so mattress and seam give a real base for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the sealant are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not permanently asleep are not appropriate because they "warm" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they hold moisture. Mould can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a rammollistic layer will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"This is how all the hokeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a rammollising layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore missues" information "of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in repaired furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy so you can enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing is pressing you and you won't go back in the night like after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squadrons.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each one bed with two seats should be 90 cm or in all 180 cm.
For single-seat beds, single beds, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association des Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorateurs that has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own sealant and mattress, so be careful, however, during the buckle to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise, you will only have to climb the seam at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, with the springs mattresses at least 15 cm, so count for the shape and aeration layer at least three centimeters.
"At the touch or sitting on the mattress you must not feel the springs," Helena Prokopova says.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of sommier.
The sommier bed, when the mattress and the sommier are united as siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; we must not wash it, which is commonly done in today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and closed) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse to demand it over a 25-year life for a mattress or a life guarantee.
But everything to his but.
And for this, a board of experience from the vendors: for a mattress of 120 / 140cm, renounce, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with slippers for the whole, that is, after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise handling for the big models (and for one person) becomes when we remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a sealant?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with aeration holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress shall not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamellets with 14 / 18 lamelles, latex mattresses or so-called sandwichs (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal, but it will always be better for you to have a mattresses with more lamelets, 28 and above, where the lamelas are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
For mattresses with multiple positions, it is not necessary to take a spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the lamelles, one can also install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special connection of the slats that allows pressure to be made even to incline the slice so that the shoulder of the dormer "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as broad as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for "men" have started using a rammollistic zone at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they offer them again a softer surface at the hip level.
For the most difficult client there are winged or platelets sommiers with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure dissects in more points and diets the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and air-inflated) on good mattresses and sommier, the "most" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinaves by exmple prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle of the seaweed or the rammolly area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something common with the first made of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattress.
Bad-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soy.
"The Bio qualificative for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop forest or lavender fragrances.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" man, coatings "heat" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favourites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a broken cell structure so more breathing than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidity of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 kroons and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached first place.
Save for mattress and sealant is not simple.
From time to time, it is possible to have two mattresses from manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
Like, for example, Magniflex, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic mosses with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were suffering from the start-up of huge load factors.
The Tempur shrink to heat and hardens, on the contrary, to cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the hot human body and distributes it an optimal pressure.
For this it is ideal against sleep evil and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
The devices to follow people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their child brings more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can be used as well to track the movement of people and help for some cases like by exmple the one of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be of the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell all that it is not spying but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there will be another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracing devices in the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in a person's bag that is not aware of, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are clients who really buy the product for safety reasons," says Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what purpose is used "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
The children's psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child doesn't want to wear something like this on him, he'll get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control. "
"Mobile phones, which can cut like these tracing devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a prepared rapt, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Now it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracing equipment develops, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
It still confesses that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracing services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device may be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the aircraft is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately reports the position of the person who slide and is in an elongated position without moving, "says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prosoftware.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those carried in a pendentif of the size of an matches box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can still lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential assailant will not be able to recognize the tracing device."
"Or he will be aware of it after some time, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendent, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-avigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cordeaux that it could make the Czech Republic round with it, but it can only take two years.
The army bought 445 km of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cordeaux is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating cordeaux from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million kroons.
The General Staff has given the reason for the huge amount of detonating cordeaux to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES has contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cordeaux.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough not more than 2 m of detonating cordeaux, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has provided - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that the shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy so much detonating cordeaux from us."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the army is a good client that we are trying as merchants to contenter," said STV Group Business Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is arguing that hundreds of km of detonating cordeaux will be used by the army for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reported only four years of life of detonating cordeaux and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," said one two who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The last life period, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free of charge and still cost money.
The department's other argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cordeaux of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police still order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and in addition to being able to obtain more flexible and more reliable types of detonating cordeaux.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact time when the two hundred thousand-and-a-half-man Chechoslovak army was preparing to move, heading over the Rhine.
What is waiting for in a few years is this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating cordeaux that it now buys "cheap."
To date, I have benefited from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the winner of the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to the successor is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
Of his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 half-demolished apartments.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building that he turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his business has allowed him to open up in Libérec 4 bed and breakfast, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds from all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another of the same quality has happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels have manifested themselves," the number 1 of the entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," added Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he has so far used his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met thanks to the competition I began to maintain business relations regularly.
In his view, the reputation related to the successor had an impact on employees as well.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in them, above all, the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been ruthlessly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind itself.
The one who came to get the prize from Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he turned a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroons.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged my employees, too, and has increased our self-confidence in fighting competition," said the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's surroundings for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they started specializing in plant oil presses.
He became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe after 18 years.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers really started to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realise that they were working with a company that got the greatest successors in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not go to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start to limit their bubbles of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Business figures have fallen by 40 percent, and we must limit our production and even lay off," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained benefits even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We built a training and research centre with dotations, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
It all leaves us to think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of affires dates back and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes unsafe regulations.
The year's Absurdity Survey is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The most glorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring in the offices documents that public servants can get on-line.
More than one third of the 4000 votes voted in favour of this.
For example, the social affairs authorities requested a paper extract from the trade register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is still for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year's 3000 votes were cast, it was at least 4000 this year who brought their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most various legal obligations that only freer the company, and, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to be completed for tax returns at the first places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneur activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74 th place in terms of conditions for the company, an additional 8 places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first put in place in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Any person may report every year administrative and bureaucratic absurdity from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition is closed.
To account for there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the greatest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last survey last year, it was about 100, or more exactly 105 regulations and decreases that lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that motorway and fast track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or even entrepreneurs with 20 employees, repeal two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the competition site.
The proclamation of the competition, which continues to begin at the beginning of November at Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a event in which political and public personalities regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts dontons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove at least three dozens of paragraphs each year that today only complicate the company, "said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd declines is not a swords in the water.
In 2007, what was not good for people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amalgamation of the Individual Business Act.
The second most plebated obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything's okay until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decrease for the physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards companies that are socially responsible.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sporting projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already been in existence for five years, is the category called the Firme Responsible for 2010.
The onjective of this competition is support for a reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor their business's environmental impacts and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the rebel of the year competition.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, registered companies that have no successors with only one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the Czech Republic is not an example of the Pragoise Prosoftware Society and Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In order to deal with employees with health problems, one can still mention Podebrad's old paper factory, which employs more than 70 per cent of them, and which, for this reason, has obtained the title of the responsible firm for the Central Bohemia region and which has placed third in the region in support of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average, without, proportionately, a decrease in wages.
The jury also devolved the title because it buys the Czech manufacturers as a matter of priority, supports a ditoyan activity in the near surroundings, and is concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, Executive Director of the company.
the responsible company IT Enlogit of the Usti Region is also thinking about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the final place is also for its activities a company of washing and cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, higher qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the company of construction of bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year Firm competition, who had responded to the attached questionnaires of the registration document and referred it to the organizer before August 15.
Incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in Lice had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the" main "competition the Firme of the Year of Vodaphone."
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firme of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police carried out arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrests in recent days.
Detectives have been handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate dealer Lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate a public call for tenders for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million kroons.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for an insider offence in the context of a public tender and concour." said for the newspaper Pravo the head of the Plzen Antonan Zelena prosecutor, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more explanation because the investigation is under way.
The police released this 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that the police actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and under no circumstances was an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as a real name "Call to propose rights for land transfer under the Land Act" and is put in place when several eligible candidates are present.
"These persons offer, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their resitution rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a classification of the purchasers is in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson for the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information about the persons who had registered for the appeal and, as he is himself, also, a person who has benefited because having bought a large number of rights for refunds, he had offered to field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he probably came up by the fact of retreating.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts above standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of former Chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
Justement Lubos G. had for example obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the artery of accessory to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the city hall for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The city hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could endanger construction by blocking land.
Households will pay a monthly supplement of about 100 kroons for housing.
As of January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rent will also increase.
As of January, therefore, families will have to draw up from their carpoons up to a hundred kroons per month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 per cent, gas by almost 2 per cent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 kroons more than it is currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices due to the significant development in the production of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count about 100 more kroons.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating is different from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 kroons more per month, Libérec's families will pay over 1000 kroons per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay a 6.8 percent supplement.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the country as a whole.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 apartments, has decided an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents that people pay in almost 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children are soothing with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashion and acts gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are soothing, who are not yet 15 years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who meet cases similar to admissions in hospital children's departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashion because it takes time to be saoûl."
'The trend is really strong alcohols, "says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of daddy into the wardrobe, it is sometimes wisky, but it is the fernet and vodka that prevails."
"Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so not feel it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today is fashion alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, seeing drunken children between thirteen and fourteen years of age in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the broad surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She put her career down at 12 when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand blood alcohol in addition to a mixture with extasy," described the doctor this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibitions Park at a party."
"The interesting thing is that it didn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter was absent 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their uncommon tolerance in the face of the fact that their rejects are addicted to the drink which is the main cause of the development of child alcohol.
According to specialists, however, there is no mention of child dependency in its strict sense.
"Under the vocable alcoholic is a chronic alcohol addiction of several years with all the phenomena resulting from it but not found in children."
"In those who use rehearsal acool, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family back-ground," said Department Chief Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the Pediatrics Clinic in Motol.
Only cases with intoxication grain that require hospitalization are integrated into stastistics.
Children who are drunk after emergency care brought home by parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: the witches day, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I have lived on witches' day an admission of 7 children drunk at once," Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the child who returned home and suffers the day after the "hangover."
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"For this they are better lotis since they spend an excellent evening then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised about where they are," says Pélikan, knowing that from time to time it ruins the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care-bed hospitalization can take up to tens of thousands of kroons.
"From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting these children how much their drunkery has cost and that they could spend all summer on seasonal work to repay one night," Pelikan added.
However, in his view, health insurance companies in their regression gestures, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday to Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer siege.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the bispace versions of L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in a state of flight.
Lestrois remaining devices are single-seat versions of L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is not yet known.
'The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for the exchange have been taken on long-standing aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence. "
"The L-159 T1 biplaces were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army will not remain without bispace since the ministry signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody in May 2009 with a value of Kroner 200 million for the transformation of four unused L-159 monoplaces into two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it is committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one that takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore the case of the person who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroons was endorsed last year by the Mirek Topomanek government.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management was arguing that the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 devices from Aéro Vodochody and only uses 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European-wide call for tenders and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the annular are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before 60," said co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health outbreaks, said Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the annular.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those with the longer index than the annular, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years of age the risk decrease reached 87 per cent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it was precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech genetician and former president of the Academy of Science, said to CTK that he is aware of this study but that he does not, it seems to him, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated."
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czechoslovakia and most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, the deblayers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93th kilometre towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague is under the same spell.
The Central Automobile Club (UAMK) dispatcher said so to the information
At 91st kilometre a truck was accidentated, at 93rd two heavy-duty vehicles hit each other, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should go out just after Brno at 190th km or go through Brno and then enter 182nd km in Kyvalka.
A several-kilometre car line has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also busted.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
The tramways are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place de la Paix (Namesti Miru).
At eight in the morning, the Prague crisis staff must still meet.
The railways and the airport are also facing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast connections.
Lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11: 00 in the night until 5: 00 in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already roulable but by redoubling vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road of Brno it begins to have by places snow gusts and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communications lanes in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been one of the most affected places.
To date are closed the axes: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow sneakers and strawberries.
We can't estimate at the moment when they can roll.
On the road to Hodonin the caution is of rigour in the region of the white Carpaths.
On roads that are, in view of nature protection, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Chequia, he fell between two to 10 centimetres of snow; he fell most in North Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
Snow-off was gradually disappearing in Chequia.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The American army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghnistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise gun.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm special ammunition developed for this rifle, containing a highly broken explosive, actually works as small grenades.
Munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
Nor is he protected from above and when he falls on a murderous rain of steel flashes, it can put him out of battle as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtains a specific target point, according to which he corrects his site target and hits the relaxation.
"Let's say you targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and tires at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 metres," said Audette.
400 unlocalized jobs
The Fujitsu group relocated its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their work place to Astro Park, which is currently located at the office building of Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers said Wednesday, next year in July, the work place of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad Quartier in Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the Astro Park open-area offices are better suited to the working conditions of the employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a key location for us with remarkable infrastructure."
He states that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company inside the region has led to the joy of the winners yesterday and the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is "an extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation."
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg's mayor, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality very soon of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the neighboring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hall. The city was criticized, not only because of the impressive development of the surfaces that once served part of a parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. One year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group based in Tokyo considers itself the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square metres have been leased in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnic Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet service provider has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may conceal political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, apparently stays in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever more force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its host to date in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to news published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said the cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the e-business, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the highest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this action earlier in view of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegal, monstruous and unscrupulous, putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the world," said an independent senator's communiqué.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information from the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecution against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have been made against the site.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, "said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of the Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the perpetrators of the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, counsel to the Chief of Government Mr. stephen Harper said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described himself as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange required the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," said Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The US government is now fully shifting the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for fighting leakage.
Mr Travers is responsible for setting up "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after Wikileaks disclosures of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to check how the whole administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they were never threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Department of State spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confiscators are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and has attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
Glacier, that is, in German the ice confiscator a little demodelled, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the chilled window using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To know that, we don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna province.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The Snow Manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 to ensure that ice creams from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and has attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered over several days. Also, practical sessions are held in the private ice shop.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is close to the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer in the future a quality European product to the country of industrial ice.
Anke from Berlin is a business management advisor and she wants, after a few years, to draw something singular from this challenging job for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master of glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
Is determinant not only good flavor, but also soothing flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender that heats all 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out a white pasteurized base cream, base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against the fact that he was misled by the spirit of time.
Those who speak only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients," may have used stabilisers in spite of this: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
It is of course possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client will not believe anything but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
It's getting more exciting with flavors.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery radius of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
Either in fruit sorbets recipes with fresh sugar and fruit.
Either in ice cream made from the white base mass which by adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and is, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The hazelnut ice does not necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it is made up in large part of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly takes the taste of an ice," Luciano says.
The production of ice is a calculation exercise: if a large amount of sugar is used, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the base recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano has an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the different fruit types (the vineyards use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It is not just the machine for automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture available to make it onctuous and brought back to negative temperatures is beated simultaneously.
In spite of all automation, light outages are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo has a purée of fruit from his head to his feet and thus splashes his study comrades when the control of the colossal bowl mixer escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a theory of conspiracy, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech on Wednesday in Munich.
Some information indicates that the President of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The requirements developed are textually consistent, by subparagraphs, with the position taken by the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in substance, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa leader recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without condition or without transitional period. In doing so, she changed her camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU control authority and the industrial lobby, which has awakened the suspicions of both the German Federal Environment Agency and European deputies.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body considers itself a neutral forum for experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feed testing in animals and that the environmental impact of these plants has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize cause in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we then find them?" asked Mr. Then on an accusing tone.
This is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region and in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are barely yet researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "industry controls safety research."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell has obtained a total of about 400 kilo.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manic.
He was snow.
History is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousands of people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the stop of construction work.
Break in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shellfish limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "A modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting it to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with this fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old French army ammunition deposit in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard station.
He says he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything at all to oppose demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project later took one of the 80-kilo-weight stone parallelopidema with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in the whole while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still in the forest, and the rest have been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of herbal platforms.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," Rongen said.
"had not been this political component."
He enters his car all the way, turns around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He has done legal studies that he has abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before he was later interested in computer and finally became a carrier.
And a stone amateur.
He's storing 40,000 tons.
He's having fun all over Germany.
He says he is the largest merchant of old stones.
He's shaking up.
Carved sand stones with art are laid on the snow.
"They were once part of Marienbrücke's bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the way that goes through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: red sand stone, previously, part of Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Nice cross."
The parallelepipède was once part of the Neckarstadion rostrum of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt crossing from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the Saint Blasian Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were hand-carved and moved with simple palans and charrettes drawn by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in play."
He has not become rich, even less richness.
But this carrier today employs 14 people. In addition, stone tops, a sculptor, a forgeron, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," the waste recycler says.
Prochainement, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent struggle to conquer the high potential
The counter has a strong influence.
16 students compass to buy small salmon loaves, tomato sauce and white mangers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the future car with VW designers, and, by the way, know Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to disnicher best brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive in the labour market and they are courtesy by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about their students' performance, we try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and to fidelity them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automotive group amends the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, candy and cards with Volkswagen's logo.
She speaks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talent; she shows them the way to access the group's enclosure.
Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who take account as a collaborator."
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," Selle said.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more harsh.
In the goods of the sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by sorting on a kyriel of candidates.
But they must vanquish their reliability and above all brush the highly skilled labour force.
It is above all Graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will further expand.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events for talent recruitment, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who has to participate shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For Mr. Dykta's talent hunter, the account seems to be there.
"To date, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to address their applications to our company soon." he says.
Apart from the direct softening in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises operate in a very classic way by participating in professional fairs where they are engaged in brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
At present, 35 positions are competitive on the company's site.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Fribourg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional internships or to write his or her project to complete his or her studies at home."
An expensive advertising campaign is being announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," Stübe said.
A long time ago, money was no longer the main role in job search.
The other key factors are flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour board for German employers.
To that end, he asked employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the employee's framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff, Ms Stübe, hoped that this placement would help to raise the image of society among job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly on external assessments with respect to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German DEBA Academy (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When we treat our employees well and they identify with the company, they make their employer's own advertising to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, over the coming years.
The Washington government has imposed a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively cancels its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform that has led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident that cost eleven employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the United States's dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces several billion claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its conclusions in December.
In October, the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the freezing of the drilling that had been declared after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after many charges of corruption, is currently being thoroughly reformed.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
The stakeholders in this sector are now publicly cautioning against the fact that the supply rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The Government's goal is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" based on the result of a current survey in the sector by the BDO audit firm, prior to the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been carried forward to further stage, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oiled; it gives a similar smell to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," launches the ecologist activist to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man in the muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat tray that surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the flashlight of water to the color of the rainbow.
It is not possible to see that the basement is grinding with brown nappes of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom said that, once, she was collecting shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have been completely late.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil wrecked out of a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the neighbouring small town of Bodo now have to pick up for six hours to reach fishwater: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the ravages jumps in the eyes when you travel through the mangrove marshes through streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat fends a brown cradle water. Anyone who plunges his hand there takes it off any oil cover.
The roots of small mangrove emerge from the soil as licorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly leave their palms hanging.
We are looking in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually see in wetlands: As long as the outboard engine stops, a fantomatic silence comes down on this paradise of the past that looks like a service station by the odour it extinguishes.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," says Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health danger."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for dozens of years: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was executed later. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous to its employees.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrel of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipeline in the whole Delta region, three times large like Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters stand in the water of steel treteaux as strange sculptures: It is very affectionously referred to as "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are roasted by corrosion to the landmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time into a piece, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that which happened in the sea during the accident of the super-oil "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who must bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider explosions of drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "much higher than alleures."
Some shapes emerge mangroves in a place that, seen by far, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with cambouis to the neck.
A scintille fire under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
We have crude oil heated in the barrel for several hours, says team leader Michael.
As a first step, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the kerosene drops are falling and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four collaborators produce every day four 300-litre Diesel drums: "This brings us 34 000 Naira," about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than that ridiculously low of just 40 cents Euro per litre of Diesel: because they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the pipeline network in perce across the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks that also include politicians and high-ranking military members, charge the lion's share in tankers and bradge it into the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate about whether to assign the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal theft and refineries."
But, in the meantime, the relations of the Ogoni, especially with Shell, have deteriorated so much that it is only about the withdrawal of the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, like the Chinese, will be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It is high time you diswarried," says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, especially from the north of the country, intend to enjoy raw material like all Nigerians.
"At all points of view, this damn thing has dropped our country down very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
By examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that may lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had visibly had more luck to date: In the course of its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of certain A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in connection with the oil line, is indicated in a position taken published by the ATSB administration this Thursday.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of reactors."
The Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 A380 series aircraft are involved.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land urgently in Singapore on 4 November, is among them.
The Australian airline has now brought legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas's director, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the carrying surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the Quantas airline had locked up all its A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily locked up three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-storey plane is the largest line plane in the world.
The fall of snow throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered with white: In one night the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos prevails on all roads, trains and planes are locked.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes Germany grelotter: By ice temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimetres per place.
Traffic is highly restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not end the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts have swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal rush to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clusters on motorways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the Meteomedia bad-weather warning plant announced the level of violent warning was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and closures.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his trip.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 train passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds have swept the roads.
Snow Falls have led to numerous flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport said that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides permanent service.
It is true that passengers trapped at the airport are no longer many, despite that just 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was locked there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a barrel on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will turn in case of light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for purchasers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's seat: The twin towers in the Business Quarter have been modernised; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their old place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the cost of refurbishment and is looking for a purchaser for its two buildings, as written by the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," citing a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy or sell the buildings ourselves, and to rehire them later."
For example, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its headquarters shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million euros from equity holders and had then rehabilitated them.
Transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, resulted in some EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, in the meantime renamed "Green Tours," at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people cried to the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for buried minors who have been declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to rebuild the bodies because the security situation of the sinistrate well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinistrate well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no emergency team was able to descend to the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors no longer had any chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be reassembled.
Today, parents and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a shining sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The personal photos and effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also included.
The flags were placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had feared the hope that the minors would go back to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the graves said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of South New Zealand Island.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told journalists that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," a veteran's epic.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his lobby and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of brutal assassination. When he is in a bad mood, he tears the intestines out of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the banner does not say any word about its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the detour of one or two sentences a few shouting agony cries.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we festoy in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Vikings universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film is targeted at several target groups, it is a pity for them to exclude each other.
The filmmaker Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher," his trilogy relating to the stuffed and style drug trafficker, like a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to art and trial cinema.
Most of the sympathizers of art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and in the intestines.
The lovers of action films die of boredom, when the banner embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only under DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that earned some attention, but also because the image of a palpitant film, from time to time, hid behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a fierce dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a luggish sound band, but above all with an unbearable hatred that spreads from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the banner, preserves a certain innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the banner hero whose motives are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, may be to send the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, roasted.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at agacing, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrassment work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications about a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, even less to submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the euphrate; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelopipeze, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric power.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would allow the production of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the plant was destroyed, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the pictures showing the building located nearby or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even with time the mystery is spreading more and more.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoranda that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an al-Kibar reactor, but had no clues showing that country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor," even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible."
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
Interrogated on how he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer by asserting that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians have certainly abducted with precipitation the rubble of the "unused military building" and made a methodical clearance of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from a Member State from commercial providers showing the time that followed the attack directly. It seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus submits that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis by calling it unbearable.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the el-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains obstinate in silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on it."
For example, the investigation of this case has been lengthy since June 2008 without reaching a result and "becoming increasingly a serious issue of credibility for the Agency," as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, it is finally a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, the existence of the other three facilities must be clarified, which must have "a functional relationship" with the presumed reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities this is, or what function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the IAEA, respectively, under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, also known as the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly next to a military base; that is exactly why Syria refuses access to the IAEA inspectors from the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians are concerned that the inspection group is in fact spies that would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by American secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone paralleloduc to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production."
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with unenriched uranium.
However, there are plausible assumptions for the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether gravates, which could hide high-value traces, have been stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land are gone, no one will have any information on the place of storage of gravates.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrate, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jan's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken terrassment work at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped to dispel suspicions.
In the diplomatic community, he said that the IAEA had spent several months preparing a plan for the inspections to be carried out, which was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets, and only the time invested showed what great interest the inspectors had in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also denied this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the United States ambassador who has been referring to what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflechir: "Would it serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in time of war
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian fellowship during the Yugoslavia War.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the shooting sequences planned in Sarajevo were displaced last minute in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film was shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests still continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and she required to meet with the actress. Jolie is herself an ambassador of good will from UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed that these women meet in Hungary, but they have declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic says.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite long about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the status of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, has granted, after some hesitation, a filming authorization in Sarajevo, but it is not known why it did not then come in spite of that authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war began. He meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
What is still a great difference with the version "a victim of rape is bogging out of his fellowship."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure that is exerted on her, as Jolie expresses herself, is "unfair and based on scourge information."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can provide him with peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, it's all right with the Irish again.
No evidence of consternation.
This is why the local team overdominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream of joy on the bottom of a strong music, they trepidate feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in South Irish vibre because players launch and succeed in dropping table tennis bullets at a distance of three meters in the other team beer jackets.
This weird show is called "beer pong." The winner has 500 Euros plus an airline ticket allowing him to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world's beer pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle game to drink and the reserved informatician, these two behaviours really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to turn away from the tedious question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling, however," he said.
"The home country is so far away and I have no job there."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has won her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Because of the dark outlook in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social assistant, resides in Sydney, and his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
The experts of the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief is now taking place.
The economic crisis, however, is particularly affected by well-trained Irish young people who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Loss of employment and social loss seemed absurd in years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes widely the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the drift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, goes away and our country so a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws powder in the eyes and offers no future perspectives for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cramponn from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She states that her greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon is organizing the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair that offers full support on the theme "working abroad."
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a slut, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost no longer."
He burns up with an embarrassed laugh when he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-treated front gardens, expensive large brand cars are stationed on access lanes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, 100 percent funded by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything fall down because of the credit?
O'Donovan is thinking for a while, restoring hot tea and saying: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"No one must suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working for a while abroad is not what can happen worse, perhaps that's what makes us first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last big economic crisis.
"He was back after he spent seven years there and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
In his palmarès, He already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be so easy for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not much emotion," he said by drinking a long gorgée of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems to be worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private business.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
As the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements come from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries along the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced democrats, thus lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy works in practice; this is the same as last year, but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but in sharp increase compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
While this has been a good one during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin American people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again decreased to 32 per cent this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey started that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victims of a criminal act over the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year).
But the United States is considered the country most influential by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A sneaky vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinned country and plunged in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot, ballots dispersed in gutières, saccaged polling stations and intimidations were presented.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wanting in the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed favorites, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protestations, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, have necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second turn to the second round.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who still live in tents, we were afraid that participation would be.
In the occurence, many Haitans wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet to the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernández, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, visibly in mourning, that she would or would not abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs remain confusing.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation plunged into the disarking following Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one member of Parliament hit one of his peers and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," said the president.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more room for manoeuvre to spend on will.
The economy is over-heating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which made forgery of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now model these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded growth as a result of strong devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs Fernández shows signs of a desire to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a forcible previous debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturity in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which is similar to a prelude of INDEC's sanitation.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to win support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very much advocated.
When the Argentines come back from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have reopened.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
A half-hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a sort of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million electors came on November 27, or 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings over the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the greatest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma was successful in the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mairies, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which looked towards Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including flags and flags of mass assembly with girls who danced in minimum dress.
A compelling mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Link Chan, Honorary President of KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A crowd man shot the young Mr. Link, just through his face, hurting him and killing a pass.
Strongly, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had an impact on the election by leading suspicion over the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid forging its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also abstained from attracting anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation of whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to leurre Taiwan, back to the bercail.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration, but let us start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following charges of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocative in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has been created under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trusted alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to break the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite dizzy economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his office and his local antennas would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the "best new artist" category
To do so at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and hand-picked singer by President Obama for his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale appointment in the "best new artist" category.
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his handy pop and funk hand, and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line with Spalding in relation to Norah Jones's full success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters have rightly honoured "Historicity" by Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "instrumental album," a virée on a revigorating chick of a record that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of clavierist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a rauque-like New Orleans favourite and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme," was honoured in the contemporary jazz category, which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the large class together; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurier Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards appointment: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic appointments for the 53th Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of world-wide musicians and composers' landscapes.
At the head of the appointments, Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominees with links to South California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony 4, "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in lice for a reward.
Classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year showcases five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies 3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Castrati art" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir du Théâtre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former Mikhail Khodorkovski oil magnet, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solist instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he was writing the 15-minute work specifically for the performer at the Avi Avital mandoline, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North African gamms and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was appointed to the orchestra category for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harlot Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only nominates of vocalists-solists: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of conventional mixtures, the soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for her recording "Racines: ma vie, ma chanson"
The Temecula Mosque project won the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics have taken place in the project, claiming that it is promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the Commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre was in compliance with local laws and that it would be esthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice wins it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, at about also distributed speaking time, according to the Press Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," a speaker wrote.
"This is another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also led to protests in other parts of the country, including at the Ground Zero, the site of the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families co-exists without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24 943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean style architecture would be made up of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a truly" foreign "life form," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday's Science journal.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
This has not been the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to activate biochemistry and that the" standard "set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Institute of Planetary and Spacial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
It wasn't a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is quite different enough to not work exactly like phosphorus; it enters inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
The arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she said; for example, the researchers hypothesized that the first life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first, "said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four flights from the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County anounced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside of a Bellflower 6 motel, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, said to Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the Sheriff department of Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood and the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a pet shelter in Downey County.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and both dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were gone until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championship "AKC / Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they planned to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events planned in the days before the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," said Peek at the Times Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and keep their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton epagneul - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corger, with the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could look fresh.
Peek and Rickard reported that the van was stolen at 6: 00 on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to any person who could lead them to the corgis, with an installed microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to rush again, the restructuring of MGM no longer awaits only the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, officially rented Thursday the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors that about $5 billion of the debt would be erased; opening the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the United States bankruptcy code, no further legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover under the guardianship of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an Allied Studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a credit facility of $500 million, planned to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a reorganization expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and to satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders, among whom none of them was ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more whose creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and discussions, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper are receiving $millions in premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have collected $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million "success premium."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-launch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012 onwards.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 ropes to jump classic pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while cost the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the button cell toys are increasing, as are rechargeable cell toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are peluche toys of the size of an Indian pig who sing a note when you press them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows to compost a song.
If you buy many, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start supporting, you can't stop anymore.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a ride into a car session with a self-correction and a valve classification.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60 for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70 for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major review of the Leapster range, with a more recent and bright screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes system to offer games and e-books and is equipped with a SD card entry that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before time flies, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) that includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
These may be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the last microrobots with a battery button.
The fake bestiole quickly moves on 12 vibrant silicone pasta in random directions.
It's fun to do a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.

To bring a softer side to law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin was looking at a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, by emitting orders with a military authority by low voice.
He wanted Chengguan women members - responsible for law and order in China, craints and despair for their arbitrary repression and their thinking for violence - to give a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand right!"
"Be perplexing!"
Show them, he said, "What do beautiful girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed the adolescence in white gloves, dressed with identical olive-coloured jackets and pants, were praying to the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four well-treated hats perfectly perched to the top of hair attached by a blue and white radiated knot.
"Personally, I think they look medium," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack trolley by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the roommate wrapped his business and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police with 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, pebble and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulties attracting a look at this underground urban brigade from China
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media are showing the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beaten an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste discharge.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stoned and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pastec roommate was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street sellers.
"Chengguan marked the government," regretted last year China Daily, a national publication, after a controversial enemy on tactics.
The paper called for "real full cleaning."
The sceptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were they just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district announcement required women candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traits of the face in the right order."
They shall be above average size, either 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"It is their image that is important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; these are size, weight, face traits, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not support this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the demand for the order of the face traits.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or disfigured must not apply.
"We can't let a person drink or a bossu come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols at Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the development of her appearance to be gender-based, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a disabused look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose a limited mandate, "they said," because they feed greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities. "
Every morning, the team faces a dozen moving merchants who move quickly by foot or by bike, trying to sell as much as possible small loaves or tofu bowls before taking the leak.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We have already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu when a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle-charrette bike.
The agents describe their functions as monotons rather than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Big routine."
One reason is that women's agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks of houses in Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by their regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, in the sinister face, spanked a road by elbow to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, co-ordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
The prosecutors will not inculperate Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised the criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to obtain lobbying for the husband of the woman, anounced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision put an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible republican candidate for the 2012 presidential until the scandal around his case made the big national titles last year and harmed his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" by the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charge against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from comments on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to whom there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign was conspiring to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a profit-making lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appeared to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the lobbying door.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to rape and substantial violation of the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be dissatisfied with political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by his section of public integrity, including the decisions taken last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misprosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking arms, "said Melanie Sloan, General Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr. Ensign, stated in an interview that he had received a phone call from a Department of Justice prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up on the following day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a communiqué, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify his legal arguments to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"I am not comfortable entering into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was everything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company hosted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "was marteling" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter at issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as a leader in the fourth Republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire pointera's call to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed evidence with the court that sketches appeal arguments, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circus atmosphere," such a widespread and instantaneous saturation with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by public passions.
The application could lead appellate judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is detrimental to human rights in a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was animated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The appeal courts have for decades recognized that the media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers stated that the appeal courts before us to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication in the courtroom, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media in large-scale trials," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue states that some appellate judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the courtrooms could allow for more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who are likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors reported being horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly evicted one of the jurors, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate in one weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the position of Governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly attracting the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily compass of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not look like anything that had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that the instantaneous news was more burdensome than the more slowly released press releases was a luddist view that would weaken the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that appeal courts often were attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes's lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial, and they indicated that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the divide closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a leading sign of a true bipartite forward-looking cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any breakthroughs on the major issues that must be addressed during the session of the "oxy duck."
But obviously there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Committee's public meeting on the President's deficit on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of trial and mutual testing to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
For this reason, the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain at miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now at the side of the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"This is inevitable after the elections.
The elections provoke partisan passions and, then, they become blurred.
That's good. "
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "bypass duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a party or the whole party, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is about possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "Boiled Ducks," with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely or even inevitable.
"Once things are to be done, psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or an shadow-boxing in relation to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the teas voters who have contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to meet their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission that include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the issue of deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group; this suggests that there are, at least today, few reasons or will for compromise.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Congress Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, since republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the public response.
Whoever will be found to be lost will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civility presented this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
Disclosed American documents describe Moscow as a havre of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and brings to the Kremlin some of the bribes and the protective money it collects, said the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes his share while money goes up the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on his website on Wednesday by Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exhausted.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but since then there have been few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unusual to imagine that it would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between Moscow's government and crime has led some people to name it as "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government works more like a kleptocracy than a government, "according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" krysha "(term used in the criminal world / mafia that means literally" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as through all the bureaucracy of the Moscow government.
"Analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report states that the FSB is brewing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, he said, "Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly see their business close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has referred to the fight against corruption several times, but he has acknowledged little progress.
The embassy note provides reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem."
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Independent, the costs of corruption would amount to more than $300 billion per year throughout Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the American embassy note, which was only realized yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will remuer with certainty the dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Loujkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the Moscow failures, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interested by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger to the statements that United States diplomats had disclosed by calling Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Red Khmer veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with shallow concrete walls of poor quality, the director of the Anlong Veng secondary school referred to the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmers rouges, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Your Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Red Khmers in northwest Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to government, long-standing loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to deal publicly with the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly headed by the United Nations, issued its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmers rouges, condemning to 35 years' imprisonment the former head of the sadly known torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch."
In view of this development, anxiety has increased among Anlong Veng's Khmer Rouge veterans; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fear among the former Red Khmers, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the Khmer Rouge reign in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overmenage.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown Pol-United States government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary headed the guerrilla at their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had held up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer-Rouge veterans have plunged into the black misery, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have maintained their positions as local leader in exchange for having deposited weapons, they are unqualified farmers in low grade and record.
"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibated by the agrarian utopic ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmers Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok nourishes everyone."
But now life is difficult because we must support our own needs. "
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to start the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the principal perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm down the fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations have turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district leader in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge reign in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, during a torride evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a ground road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun threw long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said she'd refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defended the Khmers rouges in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court were to prosecute several suspects; although experts and historians are challenging this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to recognize broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Khmers rouges, "A history of democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmers rouges.
As in most Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmers rouges, despite the links between the city and the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old, student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he came back with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They don't trust each other because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmers Rouge keep a powerful atrait here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and plated with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, a mobile phone vendor on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated at that place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many people go to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last rest place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decisionmaking is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov here on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to renounce highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials have stated in Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-quality uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter by about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation nuclear security summit, organized at Obama's initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton described the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama made a commitment in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukashenko said that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"This is our product... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell it to anyone."
"We will use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
He was loaded on a special train that travelled over 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia for storage and disposal, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace the research facilities in Belarus with low-enriched uranium; not suitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization has been implemented to build confidence," led to the agreement signed by Clinton, "said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights by Loukashenko.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government has not raised any objection to CIA flights
The government has not raised any objection to CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram by the United States Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "can 'demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign aircraft that were crossing Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, held a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega has emphasized that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid "taking them out of hand," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Externe of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lower possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the decommissioning of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States has still shown concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for the unclassified information from CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal with the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US ambassador and Internes Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented to him that "even if Spanish judges are folly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a flammed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored United States actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she said.
The parricide who went to confess complained about being a mother in a network of "accustomed"
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was small, she contacted a cousin and at least one friend; both of them from Noia, the village of Coruña of which she was born.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC built with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Welsh girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his own, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected was Alberto, a fasting man of Lousame, a neighboring municipe.
With him, she cohabited for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the kid stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her one week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idylle has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she is in Minorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and vexed for the fact that I have come to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed to him a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what means being with the child all day and not having the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a motive message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him when I go home," she claims.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to come to a job so that I can't lose it."
She explains that if everything was fine, she'd have taken her elder with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she tapes it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on 1 of that month, and he was allegedly murdered on 10, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on another."
"On one side he is with me and this place likes him a little, but on another he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There will be (the child) a few summer hours and so I save some money from the babysitter."
17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what e-mail videos, you see, when he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is good, she goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He's making me money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror to the galicia (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, a vigil, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had passed so she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday from the Minorca Judicial Detainees' Centre.
The ex-officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "nor did she intend to hurt the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor called for a psychiatric trial.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees normally double that it receives in the Catalans.
For example, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes to the 2008 General, while the 2006 Autonomics received 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the fidelisation of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 members in Congress, while CiU would also win four (there are now 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 members (there are 25 members).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - there are three now - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May of 2011 for municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the Barcelona General Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and people agree that PSC could lose the city hall of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority of the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking account of the Republican debate, it would not be fantastic that this training would lose its representation in Barcelona City Hall - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current Socialist Mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a 500-vote difference from PSC, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important municipes such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were three.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian detainees by officers of the Barcelona Police Police Information Board formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last one being the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was" debility "Al Qaida's forgery aircraft at the international level and" therefore its operating capacity. "
Investigators calculate that the cell, within two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, this is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days similar beatings to that recorded on the night of Tuesday last in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand another was held, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who had been leading the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front."
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that until now no detail has been found that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even if the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia it was sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the "commando" integrants who killed 106 people.
The police have had a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as President of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign, which is consistent with giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereign adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address to half his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People has arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to get loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the oppositions will exercise should not vote in the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made as a Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investiture "we should eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches," and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have common bets to curb the political machinery of a very exaggerated self-government and the elimination of tax on succession and donation.
Details of the Mas investiture negotiation will be done by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the dead were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for in the meantime he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "The desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility force us to take on the processual situation of civilian officials."
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot have been at any time the cause of what happened."
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a clue of imprudence from any other person than the accused."
The person already baptized as "the Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 assassinations and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him to die by injecting him a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pastilles.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October interval.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor does the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Tribunal of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in how to kill after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "markets must not underestimate our response capacity."
The peripheral differentials have closed to force and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to be mistaken, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a cautious signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it is recovering, but motivated by short and very speculative fences.
The institutional investor will be late in losing fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retrace for the fourth time tomorrow in two years and those remaining.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly auction will be maintained with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not complete the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to remove the liquidity measures, that God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they said they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought a lot, provoking a further collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year betrayal auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sense after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures of the Allied hole and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures are 10.000 million in the short term and 15.000 potential and have a period until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are insurable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a midst of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of his speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the heels of investors such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered the 4.5%, the double of the rest of the European Stock Exchange.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year obligation that will be enjoyed by the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dissipate doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million liquidity available, triple from March, to very expensive types and they cut access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, to appear."
Courage, we can get out of it!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's advice requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will argue, because he considers it "null of law," the judicial board of El Enebro on next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority and take on the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of business services for the companies does not seem to be willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting on January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Trade and Corporations Register.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 in Madrid, once again opened the barrel box within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate remedy of the applicants his five sons to try, through a processual argument, by clearly fraud the Law and by abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically zero on January 18," according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for the Assembly to be challenged once it takes place, considering that it is "null and void."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate summoned an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless seeks the usufruit out of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for a challenge for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selecte universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, in the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as the champion's pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, neither the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far from high motoristic competition.
Nominated PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants from all over the world, energy stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that using this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in short hours, almost in real time," the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explained that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team today work 180 high-skilled young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and plan all kinds of changes on the bolides.
The leader of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's bikes except the engine, which is Renault's exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can move from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit every season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bikes in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens over there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty are 580 people, including two pilots, Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula 1, probably, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the huge technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R & D progress in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring 15% of value added.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to set up 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even if she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM Personal Systems has assured that the philosophy for storing stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims "to improve the service offered to customers and MEP in purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that resolves the possible problems of HP computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service is connected with a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's delegated administrator, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
In spite of this, it provides for a collapse of interest margins, which will be tried to offset in part with increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell is waiting to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task to perform.
Sabadell has found a way to go over the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will start a new management plan in 2011, which will hold three years' ability.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to win a market rating by capturing one million new particular customers - 700.000 if one deducts those who can get out of the bank-, its great task to do, because so far this bank had spoiled more the MEP and the companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 particular customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year's Optima management plan, establishes four years ago, even if initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more fiscal year.
Customers who let the cash savings escape will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year."
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create workplaces," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking case, he said.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving at credit price to offset the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We didn't shake the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of the differential - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November -.
He also confessed that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he assured.
He states that capital needs "are increasing so much" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
He said that the FROB could replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the time-fence of markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it was not possible to issue, but instead of what happened in June, short-term funding could be obtained through rest, thus mitigating the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the banks
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger of Spanish cash banks began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completed completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much in this operation too," said the leader.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits set in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he stressed.
"The passage from 45 cases with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is an uneven trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a rather unhappy series of opinions about the slow pace of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seroity and sense," because "what the Bank of Spain does is to recall that the time limit must be met before the end of the year."
The ECSC Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world, and he has attributed to those who doubt it a "lack of knowledge."
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well off the stress tests that ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a strong government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for the MEP, regulation of private investment agencies or suppression of the €426 of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of the State Lotteries.
On another, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, unites himself with the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction to the difficult redefinition process of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistances, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible outlets of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments by one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, therefore now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought was to be done (plans for tax rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow in the Central European country was when Merkel had difficulty prolonging the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and its publication were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union treaties to make it possible to rescued a country and at the same time to force private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although a little sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process which makes these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if now we have to take action with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a cost party.
Germany tells us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just a question of extending the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are being asked for is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive us ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give us greater tranquillity.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the thesis that must be put in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone that is too burdened from unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us of it.
Sport and law fraud
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The deportation in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League made a lot of ink sink on the anti-sporting character of such behaviour and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow carton.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be a leader of his group, both players will perform the regulatory sanction during the next game of the dam game against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned with two games the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in this case is due to the fact that this has had as a protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn displays nobility and honour and who on past occasions has sentenced to a fine to his players for similar acts) and to orchestrated drama, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode further to his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation in contravention of the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because they are actions respectful of the rules of sport, but seem to eludate its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the advert players, one aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these items that we allude to with the correct game is to avoid that the team of infra-player players benefits in an unfair way from the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not fit with what is normally characterized as trichery o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not made in hiding to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalization of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and willing to accept the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that infractors obtain from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that we do not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get an advantage in the same game either, because of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from this, with this action the players perform a sanction game and pass to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than to the first cycle.
So that, engraving the steps, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not operate to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted themselves to it.
They made a strategic decision without distorting the penalty or fleeing it.
Even if the border between genius and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: because there have been two self-evictions and because of the way in which the director is transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the touron and lottery, when December comes also back the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete to complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (like the night of the Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) has concentrated the demands in the week of December 13, with as a result up to now an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Any situation, they all demand battle awards, confirms Gremi's president of Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative now does not dare to predict how the parties will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will be fine "for those who give quality at good price and with good service," he added, and recalls that customers tend to fall a step down with the crisis, so that the tranche around the EUR 25 has become majority in demand.
In a survey at various institutions in the centre there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group states that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjoncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the speciarity of the calendar assumed more early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the parties in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champenoise method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the patronate Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Divertissement Association), his vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "animated," even if customers "negotiate to the maximum."
This is true, hope for festivities has not fallen, indifferent from who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks' filtrations confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the United States Embassy of Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details of the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "declines" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The specificity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is being considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferant and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is every time reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear armour production.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" the person responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the head of Wikileaks
Obama will appoint a high-level anti-terrorist officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates back to November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents, but with the charges of sexual abuse that the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
The 20-year-old international police force in Lyon, France, ordered the order to be applied for by Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 countries of Interpol have received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the arrest order of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free way for arrest - which the national police body must realise - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be found.
The movement blamed Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange has sought and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief Security Officer of Staline.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounces.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he was not.
On Monday he gave an interview from an indefinite place to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who they look at the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should be of interest to us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself has charged a high-level anti-terrorist leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leakage of documents.
The trial by President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the opinions that Conservative politicians and commentators have proclament these days.
Peter King, the congressist who will preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber in January, asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and prosecute any person who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further away went Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper's advisor, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into a goal and use a plane without a crew or something similar."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"He who is in the Government that filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and all that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in ERC with clins of eyes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the internal rebellion within ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches that he had with other extinguished currents.
This is why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new critics with clins of eyes that allow him to blinder up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by lifting hands.
If the carodists want to carry a certain vote of penalization to the President, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the President a little more than making his position available to the militance, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maxime organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignation, they will try to accept with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for vote on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The ERC leader has confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considering the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militance, that is, include new figures that come from Carod's adept sector.
The second can be the great news character.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as a operating mechanism.
For example, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows for the completion of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse concluded in 2008 instructed management to revise the assembly model in a specific convention of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the forefront, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders we mention these of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
In the last few months of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases are mentioned the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipe de Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the graceful shot to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the baggage port of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of municipe Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning Thursday, the four, the owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the autopist near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipe Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he was out of his house to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by an impacted head shot each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipe de Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the coup de grâce in the front we found a man's body on a lonely road to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet with a 25-calibre firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies carried out a comprehensive search for the rest of the body, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, hands attached behind and eyes bordered.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in the neck.
Half of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas department of Hacienda in the municipe Atizapán of Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered with the victims at the same time.
One day later, a box of cardboard that contained a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipe of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a close colony one found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of Ixtapaluca municipe and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executors had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshot in the neck, one found a woman's body without life in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, we detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found at the edge of a car in Zinacantepec municipe with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with the enruban head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, who said, "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with attached hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipes of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon tape and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Close to him, the agents found a break-up with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made huge efforts to reduce the coal trace and had detailed that it maintained its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 to 45 per cent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, representing China at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made huge efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country had invert $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutional building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed in terms of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local governments to achieve energy savings targets, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of filament lamps by economical lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the Government's scientific advisor on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than we think.
For example, he said, China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are three tons per person while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase a 20% energy efficiency over the past five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion from Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN has detailed that the former Panist Leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is of law.
PAN National Leader César Nava Vázquez has assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos has been legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is of law.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, if any, by making a claim to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary" we are savouring it and making us stronger, "he said.
He said that the Council may be able to elite the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the Council."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He planned that the party's recovery in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next dispute, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hopes about them, and I am sure that Gabino will be up to expectations."
When asked about the criticism of PRI against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that Zedillo y Salinas' governments have been better than Fox y Calderón 's; that they are starting to defend them; that they are out of' wardrobe '," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditory, because in the country there is no bâillon, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call tus senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call tus senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitter Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyber link with a broader document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush era tax reductions and government funding are continuing.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agend can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that he would request a "closing vote of the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have remained in that country for the last five years and have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But the supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the party organizations of the project protagonist an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act supporters require the vote of several Republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courtesy republicans there are senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing senator George Lemieux of Florida, who has completed the mandate known as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they are not going to support it in another opportunity.
Another republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
While the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Plaisirs was a walk in which participants spread the narration
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Language Plaisirs, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound... "puts us in embarrassment," gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative wire.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my fort, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyst that the mystery reveals: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The supirate protagonist relieved and concluded: "On the wound I have only been able to know that it is that is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very interrelated.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a stunning narration he called Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With the keys of magic realism, he spoke of a famous sluggish who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a dammaid had lost, a narrative that then came to America, the great news that had his own chronicles from the beginning and cited to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narrations of the conqueror capitals.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) mocked fake witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an aitre way one would never have conted America's history with an imagination that even lacked dull."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, one no longer knows what part of the narration belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is indeed called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy that we are what we are talking about."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le doit on the wound.
Cubaine-Puerto Rico has put its own on the great plague of social violence that its country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces the disputes of trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "this must on the wound of the committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind each affirmation there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we need to nuance: and nuancer means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very convenient by thinking in caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find among themselves a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had high and low in his career, but he has been able to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the thousand and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentin finally consoled with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The santist strategist arrived at its first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held Morelia's dreams with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in the 2003 Closure he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenaire Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, because his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty series he obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump at the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he does not want to have the same spell, he tries to break off from the malefice to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the wheelchair commented when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the arbitrator does not whistle the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides to his players: "We never seek to arrive to the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold the title in our hands, he has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we will no longer arrive in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a subchampion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to Visa Claimant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the United States Embassy and Consulate will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to Visa Claimant Service Centres (CSA, according to its acronyms in English) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for aspirants, including:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for application visas (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for trader and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not be required to present themselves at an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because of the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in it less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service rate of $26.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Administration of Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1: 00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it cited the press, NASA assured that it would present which would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life, "which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that we thought were inhabited and put on the table the possibility of becoming smart beings like humans if its living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an ambiant that we thought was too venimous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenics.
In any form, the creature uses arsenique as a way of living and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenique in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
At the conference will participate in geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Congress's Organic Law, it is possible to arrive at the 'bipartism', we are denouncing.
The 60th had just settled in Congress when an opposing block appeared led by the Members of Parliament of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60-e Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonn' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are initiating the 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, beside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way it is the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to NAP and PRI representatives to change the scheme on the basis of political will and if they have not, they will again be served by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"So far (the opposing coalition) has happened, that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they now talk to other colleagues to make them more, has abundant the Convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that the Congress has now become a 'butin' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the Member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside to 5 who are likely to be 9 Members, now to the five we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have done, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the Supplier"
Mazatlán City Hall pays another cheque to the questionned owner of the electric equipment company.
Another 200-mile pesos cheque for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electric equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipe transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was issued last 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of supplier account."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, cheque compartments will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, on October 19, on October 29 and on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the State Official Journal, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ESA, to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a review of the cheques that the City Hall issued to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennate of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, with cheques over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be cared for
The tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and plan a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be cared for and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid close shops.
"Politicians do not know that it means closing a business one day and they do not know the fortune that we lose, elsewhere they do not do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Town Hall.
"The municipe will have to assume his responsibility and avoid it going through again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just do the fix," he said.
"We wish to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must it be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there, and the Town Hall must change its strategy to well maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, like for example Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it only depends on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need, and this type of fact points to something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, because they are not used properly and are projecting a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be online together with the municipe and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that they can add to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP calls for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members should assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations to which they are confronted.
The business sector in Mazatlán calls for a legislature of work worthy and free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60-th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrants of the Government Congress are clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members should assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations to which they are confronted.
"We hope that deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascarade of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Government is making.
"We will ensure that they are doing a dignified and especially engaged work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Association of Tres Islas Hotels, has considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is uncomfortable as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and is directly competing with the agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help to give sureté to the state and update the Alcool Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mage
Puppies, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wish of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Mages Kings will be difficult to perform their illusions, because their home is neither more nor less than 12 people and a knife.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so wish.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live daily because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'feathers' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, three years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long been aspiring to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests large clothes for one year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him" we will see, my son ', because he was very expensive, "remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For larger children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, chausse size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, chausse size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, chausse size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoe, so a pair of the size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke Court within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Quebec Security Estrie, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Régie, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' Bill, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of vessels loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties reported on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand up with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for the possession of up to one year of any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was at the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected from hand-to-hand criticism that his party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' Bill because it deals with refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively telling Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, those criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a paillasson."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to elections in the event of its rejection.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every Member who opposes would then explain to his or her constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil argued that this idea was not a date of yesterday: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as of January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no more necessary for the pequist public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a bunny out of a hat" and "a flattered solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he says. "
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest does not want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is by Jean Charest's resignation," says Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he said.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's cartons.
Quebec would also request that Ottawa amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the Prosecutor for Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking at some of the amendments related to this case.
In the Spring 2001 operation, which struck rider groups, even if the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to high precipitation in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated on a preventive basis.
In the evening, another slide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road has gone down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, high rainfall occurred in several regions, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitation must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is concern that several rivers will overflow.
Inondation warning was issued on Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Safety for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flooding watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, high precipitation has led to the overflow of certain lakes, in Saint Julian, in Saint Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on an alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
The Centre de prévision des crues du Québec, for its part, issued on Wednesday high flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Partially blameless Dupont
Radio animator Stéphane Dupont has undergone a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some words contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not suitable for programming during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two individuals who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programming broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Joint Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
The facilitators must present strong information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a coward gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes involved in" Dupont le midi "have addressed a sensitive subject in an equitable and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore held in his place.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had made no gift to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on that."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," the animator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has collaborated "beyond his obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during high-listening hours within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealers of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve in the professional. "
"In my case, I am looking for fighting everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security agent and as a clerk for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained. "
"At present, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The fighters who finished among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament in fifth place, when I arrived third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot beatings, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the supertournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the kung-fu.
"This competition is the most successful and prestigious in China," Gaillard explained. "
"This is a little equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analysed. "
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown one champion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor firms has received the most important, the stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without a call for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Gérance was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gérance consortium was falling off the profit-making contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that may eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"This is the new way to make collusion and to cut down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing this in a secret way, now do it in an open way," said Pequist MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in the press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he was difficult to see how public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replica in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she plagued, arguing that the PQ had been "unhonest" and "lacked rigour."
She said "it would be the slightest thing" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortia formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of work.
The construction site is under way and is expected to take place until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As was revealed last week, The Devoir, the formula of consortia in the engineering consulting sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid overview of the Quebec Business Register allows for more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings Dessau back to one and the same legal person.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "James Bay territory has been responding to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically since the 1970s."
The great boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made the project's stewardship contract deaf from the fact that it was granted on an openly basis.
"If you go on bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has rounded 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting his participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $499,773,344, including the $295,131,564 Energy Stewardship contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has forgotten that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance it," before clarifying that it is more about its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - "Green" label does not inspire confidence
Green, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in fair brands and ecological certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he bites in a media universe where messages in favour of more responsible consumption spray, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even qualifies as a brake to his commitment, says the responsible consumption barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumer Observatory at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications affixed to the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the politicians' speech on this issue seriously.
However, responsible consumption information seems to be paramount in order to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
The lack of information and the doubtful nature of it would calm the arders of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers are also discouraging the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from local traders and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But its social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers reported using public transit or advocated cowling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first cliché.
A State loan for eXcentris redemption
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the repurchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallèle, agrees to work together, but with only one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallèle, who hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him its full cinephilic vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but under its own conditions.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from government offices.
A first action plan and a demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan have been sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to answer them.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the State's gift should really be discarded.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state in support of eXcentris's repurchase, arguing that the Department of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinema rooms.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of cans, for ten years brought the author's cinema to his premises in the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalty its customers.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push to the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by projecting Xavier Beauvois's very beautiful film Men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Devoir and we don't know what he and his group think about the downward proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States considers to be the complex of inferiority of Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time they betray the sense of superiority of Canadians to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that each Canadian elector does not have Canada-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to have its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread in public place yesterday, offer more croustillant details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of a federal election campaign, relates to how much the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gave a few explanations to this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may be a condition for Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily life rather than to bring this election to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elephant proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The Ambassador understands all the less this "daunting silence" since both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logibly," he said, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the federal budget confidence vote in early February, by which Canada will have its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan," says Breese.
No mention was made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast to CBC sent back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which there are unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA muscular interrogation abductions.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the spirits are flowing from the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs that still monopolize 50-70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent light bulbs or, better, by light light light light bulbs (LED or "LED" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to detract from this balance sheet again 5 Gt in order to stabilize the 2-degree-centigrade rise in climate by 2020 in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by two more times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new light bulbs at DEL, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rheostats as well as emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have shown reservations to fluocompact bulbs since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up instructions.
However, the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States only, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion per year in electricity purchases and $8 million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 billion thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost it $2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is waiting in nervousness for the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "without delay" publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the expiry of the time limits.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the head of the United Nations. "
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure of some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the deadline for Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday vote.
Around 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls increased on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS finally proclaimed the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the missed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of President Ivorian, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing President's supporters from going to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were taken by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, found the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, on Sunday, was supposed to overtake the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on 31 October with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% with the overseas departments), show the fixed data of provisional seasonal variations (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed to 9.3% of the labour force in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for employment.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% by including DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed under the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+ 0.2 points over three months and over one year), which is 482 000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with DOM.
Only 25-49 years of age had unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, + 0.1 points over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy about its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini under examination and in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste processing companies and brother of the president PS of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and screened at the Luynes Arrest House near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, recel, active corruption, influence trafficking and ammunition detention, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, to AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS strong man in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has, through his lawyers, had to pass a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and screwed up.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything else than to run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of them, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Chief Executive Officer of Aubagne, was examined on Wednesday for misappropriation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation of the facts he is accused of."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been put on trial and released on the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial control, said Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "trade in influence and passive corruption."
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined for "subtraction and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission," the other for "complicity of diversion of public funds."
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "recel of abuse of social property."
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently listened in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from the big banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
From a close source of the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," held the opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the careful look of United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some underneath this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not been the counterpart of the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a crue light the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases."
Elysée's policy advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals who are forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "always march" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
For, after attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not resolve anything," the Iranians are "masters in dilatory manoeuvres."
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactics: taking hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, when she refutes at the French Embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros in security).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States calls for extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine systems for the acquisition of nuclear equipment, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted a merchant?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There have been strong exchanges between the French Presidency and the Seal Guard" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision" judicial, "he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser consists of a phone number, catches up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not move its efforts, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles report the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the 'blitz' media of French officials."
On what is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is wondering.
"Despite their commendable statements, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to reverse in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immerated."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sown seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it from good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow the confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received it at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans spent midnight
The South Korean government will enact a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental officer responsible for the bill.
The online games will be available again at 6: 00 in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents are asking for them, added the person responsible.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report a variety of facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: Fifa designates host countries
In full turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday designates the host countries of the World Cup 2018 and 2022, a prominent political choice where the struggle for influence and lobbying are likely to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the 2018 edition of the fifa queen competition will take place in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implantation in the United States or Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities among the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is a measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
The backstage tractations are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the Fifa evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at voting time.
The Sunday Times, which had led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, a football cradle that only once hosted the World in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer on Monday by disseminating a documentary that spreads three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to do with the Fifa and put in embarrassment the English leaders, who have been in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organisation of the OJ-2012.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to redeem England's blason to the EC?
There is nothing less secure because the duo Spain-Portugal has no lack of assets with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could doubt their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, becoming a weight outsider despite the shortcomings in its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a barely voiced allusion to the charges of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appeared as the logical favorites.
First World Economic Power, headquarters of the major sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a long lead over Japan and South Korea, which have built separately a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the World-2026 to China, ardemment desired by the Fifa, which would in fact make the Asian chances untrue for 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the great game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the hourly lag) by European countries, the nerve of war for Fifa.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant at the Elysée calls another.
So the current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is not good with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to pretend that the doubt still exists.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term of office was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011."
He referred to UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night at the Elysée, so the prospect of "two warrants" has soared a bit of fibrility.
Was that the official announcement of his application?
We were far away.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of five years to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he evokes the presidential, in the tone of humour, in such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you're still seven and a half years old with me," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His speech before yesterday does not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS application race, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's lice entry that makes Nicolas Sarkozy unveiling himself.
On the contrary, because his application in 2012 is obvious that many of the PS demand an earlier than expected battle order.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the application of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's surroundings.
"If he believes that defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," confided Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," says Alain Juppé, who is clearly resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year had to be an opportunity to clarify the way out of crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt issuing institute may not be able to afford to be as peremptory as it may aggravate a more than tense situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the more high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in resolving the state debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program for the purchase of sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my thought to my European partners (...)."
The day before in Brussels, at his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more disappointed about his intentions, simply stating that the programme for the purchase of state securities in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to market operators' indiscretions, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued procurement (see page 29).
The economists also do not expect any significant change in course.
While loans over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still has unlimited cash allocations under generous conditions for periods of one week to three months.
The economists are now expecting that this scheme will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's making an important change to her program."
"Otherwise it would take the risk of causing new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, Economist of Commerzbank.
"A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds to animate an atone market," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issue institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all prices replace the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent an overlapping of the yields paid by the most fragile states," a major bond manager yesterday testified.
For if interest rates fly away, the states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The backup of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the back round
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday, with the reversal of the bond rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "unencryptable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied.
Tuesday in any case, the German long rate gap had reached the record of 210 base points and the price of CDS had fled to 263 points, leading to a certain breakdown in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax returns that goes with, leading to the risk that the State will no longer be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate table of 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% planned by the Government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget group that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At present, Italy is being supported by international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good," we have been saying for a long time, "says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator of Italy's International Monetary Fund in charge of the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those requested from other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period of unfavourable decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-rise devices
Christine Lagarde made it again yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have shown it again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although relative, yesterday's discount on European State bond rates has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about a start in normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could degrade the debt rating of Portugal, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas's economists.
All the more so because "political time is much slower than market time."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the most directly involved finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform extreme-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first EFSF securities issues are planned next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment by the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to closer-impact austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both of them wish to avoid seeking international assistance before setting up their own budgetary corrections and to decide on structural reforms that are essential for the long-term rebuilding of confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardizing sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with, to date, €60 billion.
A board that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and are likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, have added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, and it snow weak on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are significant enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, "says Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been prohibited from heavy-duty vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend only to take his vehicle if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was prohibited for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Branch (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France had been full, the billions were raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of its double loop funding in the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Financial Amending Act, reviewed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special capital tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax are EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that bring back?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is stated that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project takes place," can be read in the explanatory memorandum.
At the GSP, this shocking system is not found.
"From the time we create revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover three-year studies and then type in the next 4 billion," it is explained. "
"This will be included in the budget and drawn as it is."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, may cause a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers vengers and spies in due diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it shows itself an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only before the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sincerely caricatural profile was long for sketch-subject cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records must only be made up of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who want occult only believe that they already know, and that reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Idem for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or in limited spirit) the chief of secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor in Liberation), who only holds as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of states can call or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centres.
Any investigative film viewer knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place American diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world brings a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal does not therefore put the victims as much in crisis as the "bourreaux."
But let us come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, we could imagine all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we show, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a venger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be unveiled); it is true, too, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secret, because it is relevant to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to remove all power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on line any reserved information - it would be to publish it on a poster on the corner of the street.
But it is equally clear that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the time being, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move in a discreet way in diligences with uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in closed keyboard drawers: at the bottom, the attempt to espionage the Watergate has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crab, that is, back-to-back.
A century after the wireless telephony revolutionized communications, the Internet re-established a wireline telephony (telephone).
The (analog) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communication policy and techniques return to horseback cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies who request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bids its pledges for funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the fast start or early funding promises made by developed countries.
And the big French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (€420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the great game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and valued at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had reached EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of official development assistance.
Concretely, France's total support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 €lended is equivalent to 1 €given.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are cost-effective (often projects related to mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lender country (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France only has such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by making 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% of grants (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass-by tower!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and on the other, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it can make it believe that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely dupe...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relative short-term issue in relation to all climate discussions.
But it could be another grain of sand in the huge machine that UNFCCC is.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of compliance with its commitments and equity with other EU countries.
But above all, France could move forward on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be overlooked.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingest in one day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (ex- Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," bought food generally consumed in four meals and one ink in one day by a dozen-year-old child in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liter of water per day - and friandises, have been reviewed by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical taken are not exceeded, we see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and / or PE is of concern," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogens and three proven carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as an incas by the study, presents traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide that is still prohibited in France.
Same for Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, haché steak, canned tuna, and even bread wand and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the "wealthiest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal to the microwave was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" is probably underestimated, "according to the study.
The Europe Ecologie-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Security Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
