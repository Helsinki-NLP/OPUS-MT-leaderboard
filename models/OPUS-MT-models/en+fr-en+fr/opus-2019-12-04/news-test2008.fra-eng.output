Inflation in Europe has slowed down on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the European Community Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, "said Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the leading interest rate by saying that the decline in interest, with the growth of raw materials prices and the decline in unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be discouraged" in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later stage.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent has been a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Cereal term market ratings have increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 per cent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the master rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December. Thus, since 2002, it has currently had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never previously seen such low socialist support, that is, 13 per cent.
For faithful voters, the difference would represent more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of support for a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party) due to the greater determination of the opposition voters.
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two per cent throughout the population.
Of the faithful voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, it is 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complements the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is planning to worsen and only a tenth is planning to improve the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, that is, a majority never seen in Gallup's previous surveys, found that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather wrong than well.
13 percent of the respondents have confidence or much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be treated without change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
To the question about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly go to vote and the 20 per cent additional said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to hold next Sunday," only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would not be doubtful.
74 per cent of people would say no to the fees for higher education, 79 per cent would say no to the cost of consultation and 84 per cent would say no to the cost of staying in the hospital.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital travel costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost 20 percent
The hypermarkets in Budaörs' commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Panier also increased by 16 per cent on average, a value increase well above a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "which had already fled" in the major food stores last December, no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily Panier in the sonded hypermarkets has exceeded at least 91 forints, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of turkey net, nuts and poppy increased sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but at Auchan, one kilo of bread was found only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the registered bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it was only 257 forints of the recorded bottle included.
It only prevents this year, in terms of Panier daily, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Panier by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate had already been noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not visibly determine what margin applied to products so long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader poorly calculates the rotation of a product, it may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to trade intensity.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily Panier prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was higher than last year's 1 630 forints and the prices of the least expensive increased by 1 284 forints as well.
By reconciling the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items have increased by more than 30 per cent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some of the basic needs, the Statistical Institute has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, for flour and egg.)
According to Panier's daily Panier, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 per cent from the base.
The evidence suggests that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to have the sharp price increase also accepted by multinational companies.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-standing food by pallets.
Wednesday morning important tails were formed in the three hypermarkets because the number of customers has increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly due to the incorrect use of antibiotics, were registered in hospitals.
The health conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago a MRSA infection was diagnosed at the János Hospital's traumatology service.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on an hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to return because of a MRSA infection and since then, the doctors have not been able to do a significant operation because of the bacterium in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multiresistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multiresistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people are wearing Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angines, amygdalites, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant antibiotic bacteria that will rapidly proliferate under bad hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on elderly patients, small weight or with weakened organism.
According to the director of János Hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of hospital daily.
Above all, infection with the epidemic should not be confused, MRSA is not found only where it is not sought, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the caring staff put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is particularly evident in hospitals and in elderly residences, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases only occur if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief doctor of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes are also in place.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological levies are even more rare in ambulatory care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, significant gaps are detected in hospitals also in this field.
MRSA proliferates by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemic, patients should be removed from each other by a minimum of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less manifestable or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is exorbitant expenditure for social security funds, which is why it is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multiresistant pathogens (such as MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official finding concerning the fatal accident caused by the 22nd district commissioner was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the 22nd district commissioner, resigned from his post since, who crashed a pedestrian by provoking his death last Tuesday, would have led to drunkenness or dizziness, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not used alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police station crashed a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, on Kossuth Lajos Street of the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian passage.
(In fact, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian passage is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident has greatly affected him.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office for Investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest with a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit contract of EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The agreement on the €150 million credit also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties have signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, and the state budget will use this envelope first as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
In the negotiations, the draft of line 4 of the subway was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would rediscuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary had finalised the details of the financing of the subway with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB shall grant its appropriations in accordance with the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans, which has not been mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will become expensive quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
At present, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most envisioned target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses by the cheap sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Sables d'or," the "Sun Coast," the old Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to Re / Max Bulgaria's analysts, sooner or later, the central region of the country, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office surfaces promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf havens and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors already buy in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. At the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski stations, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
The people who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dashed houses, at a price of between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term surplus value.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly increasing as a result of a growing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, over the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication from Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this time, strong discussions are being held on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss accurate figures, but was ready to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent from the 1990 level until 2020.
Another important subject of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, apart from emission reduction, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on the aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a Board of Directors of 16 members probably under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to continue its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement," and was ready to reduce them to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and / or developing countries were also ready to make commitments that were appropriate to their responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made 8 per cent less commitment.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from the level of the period 1985-1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which has been highlighted in the new report of IPCC, the international scientific body, which has obtained the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize, to deal with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units communicate on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of making themselves popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has been passionate about YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan are loading video sequences on operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londrès or the compatriots load them over the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered itself as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were placed on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to publicize the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way does not cost much to the usual television-based recruitment advertisements, which have been communicated to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably bears a political message as it justifies in a special form the suitability of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is bothered because, apart from carefully designed and composted videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrites, officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos were already on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has been working for the loading of these videos only recently.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently by using the American's Army's shootout game downloadable for free. In this game, the player can get directly into the place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and beignets in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beignets and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchanting public servants with a tomb and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Fête, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertain power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Department who will be invited to it.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Department is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the year-end atmosphere.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will festoyer.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320 000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigour, there will be actors and also a tomb.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million forints, the rest was spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The Gaîté Theatre building has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
The suit is not mandatory.
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a prom on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing party on live music.
Reply to the question of [origo]: the evening was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite his employees officially to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to take a coffee and eat beignets, has communicated the press service, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his employees to take a drink at the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since János Veres arrived, PM employees have been celebrating Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned party atmosphere, official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's briefing but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas Day will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the communication of the Ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not party at all for Christmas, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The mega-strike forces come together
The League trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission on Friday to coordinate the indefinite strike of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This will certainly result in significant traffic closures as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and BKV's employees (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The League Syndicates will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike commission will also be set up and will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indeterminate period if they fail to reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Cards Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on what action to take.
On Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Cards Act will only take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, large traps are planned in the traffic: the railways will stop work for an indeterminate period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strike, and their list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report making the strike for an indeterminate period, others reported a temporary stop to work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Cheminots (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, or, as the Christmas parties approach, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the League's Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Union will strike four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union called for a strike for 2 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 8 p.m, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike all over the country in alternance, the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will conduct a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims made by the League requires the government to withdraw its proposal for health reform and to put a new approach to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be put in place from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the system to pass on the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Cheminots (VDSZSZ), attached to the Union of the League, of the proposal by the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk country
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary), in several aspects, increases the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning," the company notes that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the worsening ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary."
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to cause this situation to be the main reason.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians."
The problem is worsened, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country."
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, giving the name of "national self-defence association."
"The common feature of these assemblies is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (disasters, national defence, law enforcement), armed if necessary, by referring to the inaptitude of the police, the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They reported that everything was going on according to the method which, based on the ransom of the political society and the parties, seeks to taste different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on civil character and association status is therefore only used to avoid legal traps in the registration of these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries cite the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and the ultranationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influence the political stability of the region, "they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is, for example, similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many problems of Roma who have erupted in a Sofia district (Kraszna Poljana) have led to the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
In taking advantage of these events, UNB decided to form a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence."
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, "says Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had given rise to extensive debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own custody as a resistance points to the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in the same way by organising their own self-defence, can be read in Political Capital's risk warning.
At the request of the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on risk change, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the party days and, around the parties, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Fêtes are not uniform in both the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national and state parties and the days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious parties or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the awakens can rest quietly.
On the other hand, in one year we have eleven red-marked parties in all.
March 15 is a national party, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as is October 23, which is also the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the labour party and November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and our dead friends.
In addition, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state parties, national or religious, rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize business days in cases where only one working day remains before or after the red-marked party.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For long years, the Minister of Labour has been acting in a particular regulation on days of replacement for days prior to or following the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that turn uninterrupted and in service, by their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from December 24, life ends almost all over the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many parties fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the labour party to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the parties because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can really bother colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, the voice messages that we never receive, the innocent lies that are almost more annoying us: these are things that "embellish" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we are used to these problems or we are facing the challenge, and we consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems to others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that we called you marketing service," a colleague said.
That you missed a date?
At best he's sorry and trying to fix things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with apology.
Before you have hard explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more energetic than wanting to take a file, a desktop tool or the phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember the day before you put the stapler on the office, but she disappeared the next morning?
You think you could find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be mad at you for staring at their good.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it back in your pocket because it can be bothering that there are no more envelopes and you need them right now.
Are you papoting for colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop potins that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Enterre in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You think you're sick without just reason?
When you call the office and say you're sick on the pretext of a disgusting headache because you feel bad or you think you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your long-term missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't be in trouble with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to warn your chief and your colleagues to avoid them being surprised about your absence the next day.
Fucking, squirting, phone.
You get into your job, but your colleagues' stinkling out of it brutally?
You became, without wanting, a witness to a phone discussion you would have done better not to listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with brakes, blackmails, high-voice discussions (which you bring above their head), foot beats, big words or discontentments expressed high-voice.
They may disturb even if your colleagues are not plunged into a project (writing, design, organization).
You accuse others for a fault?
If your work is not done for the time limit, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't blame anyone for that misunderstanding!
Don't put it on account of possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize him if you made a mistake and if it had disadvantages for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
You feel too much at home at the office?
Put a jogging and socks is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don't put a comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving gently into the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones from time to time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's Wings of Love song.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dancing music and pop, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.,
The Ferenc Török season).
The training at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty largest disks in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his set became unquestionably "trendy" but no one asked them if they would wear this label.
The band has reacted properly, it has released a new and better disk.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new lines for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from the former Balázs Zságer Pécs group.
We are well there with the reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, one finds a real tube for radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce Wings of Love's melodies recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked questions in Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: has your music still been a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell it and become commercial.
A good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially west light music has older traditions.
The, people go to concerts, not only ten or twenty years old, but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that people are coming to our concerts more and more.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve an objective but for a specific reason.
The public's role is more important in concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the unbearable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Will you follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his way even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who have confidence in the music presence of the other and let it be deployed.
At first, it was certainly inevitable that our music should be compared with that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another way.
hvg.hu: On mr2 Petõfi's palmarès, Wings of Love takes first place.
Many of them have heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We do not plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
The six-member choir, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikā Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we made up the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The suite of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody the girls learned later.
I got it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a brief solo by Judy Jay), they have no role alone, they all sing together and they do not sing stronger than music, so music does not just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene, too.
Is that what it means?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
However, what was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted the others to feel that euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you work most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "dropped" this record.
At this moment, it is Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfide to risk billions because of his inferiority complex
A dissimulator.
This means his former employee the French giant the General Society, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost because of him almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equalize his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapacitated.
Unlike all the large bank houses, he recognized in time the US mortgage market crisis.
"He is fragile," let his superiors hear who denounced him to the police.
However, with Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of €1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis goes beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-premium" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet.
As a result, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing for himself. "
Throughout the interrogation, he confesses to having distorted the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to duper his superiors, although the Eurex Exchange began to interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything is nothing.
Was he afraid he'd be discovered?
No, it's not.
"I thought that the simple fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did his will to risk so big?
He only gradually arrived at his position.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51 thousand.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and in 2005 he became independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course, "said investigators Kerviel.
But shortly after he took office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won half a billion euros by building on the decline in this title during the Londrès attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - it wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I win, they pretend to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year comes to pass.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he comes to work, he's no longer employed in the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost €5 billion because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another, "Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech Kroons) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that Czechoslovakia can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly DKK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be directed to the Czech regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kroons under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to $150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain through these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transportation Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic was among the most successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (close to Kroner 1.8 billion).
He was later released and lived in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, operating between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be incarcerated again, it is not clear for the time being, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or again go to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved the government's money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious societies, and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went to the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted.
That's how it is.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of government without support from the opposition.
The one for the current year was spent a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate before the vote of the statement of defiance to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although most influential, is usually neglected.
This is some kind of paradox.
Whether it is desired or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is an integral part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power against government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive mediately, and that's why she is given more attention in the media.
Politicians' disputes are much more relevant to opinion than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments were suffering from three problems which the current budget is not able to resolve at a time:
The first being the large share of the costs of warrants imposed by law, made up not only of pensions, but also of social expenses, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second being a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the State budget that represents the greatest aléa.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the city and local deficit.
Many mayors often issued, in dizziness, bonds, indebting their municipalities disproportionately, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they were able to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatization.
Today, they no longer have this source.
On the basis only of official and verifiable facts, it is found that:
Our economy has already been going through for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth, and ČSSD is not missing.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
But instead, they were more and more in the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that is based mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at the global level least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes that have, in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditure has been removed, approved last year before the elections, if a shift in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever will be in power, it will only be administered.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes regular costs deducted by the costs of mandates.
The 2008 deficit of $70 billion would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not discarded all the money they could.
If we do not really want the policies in power to become simple bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what happens to be levied on taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only these will allow a balanced state budget to be gradually achieved.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be placed in monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, interest rates to which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send an auction of $40 billion and, in addition, will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action to this concerted point, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," written in his report to the clients Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unrefunded loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for further losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still follow," said the chief economist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could influence economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, was not successful in lowering, used to borrow into the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, although the US, Canadian and English Central Banks had repeatedly decreased their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to combine the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall in the US real estate market.
President Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the issue of global warming.
This time, the criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President pointed out, in the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with what his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only meet the caricature of my opinions."
From now on, interested persons can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough provisions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to monitor and appreciate scientific treaties, has the practice of statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too large nor too serious, so they are no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
All the more so since he has experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose invariated opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous violation of freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have not been able to renew their driving licence over time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the time to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that authorities can issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are plagued with applications and the number of licence renewal requests has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 clients a day.
There's a half-hour tail about.
In Prague, almost 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issue of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver shall pay a supplement of five hundred kroons.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to make the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid permit, will risk a fine from January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand kroons.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine increases to CK 2,500.
According to old information, it was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 kroons.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to impose moderation and fines not exceeding CK 1000.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide whether to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring it or to send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 are still three years old to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koñařík, former police officers accused of connivence with David Berdych's gang, will be 13 years in prison and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Prague Superior Court has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
The detectives of the Department for the Control of Organized Crime were originally at risk of 14 and 12 years' imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is not waiting until now for the verdict of first instance.
However, in other trials he has already received sentences of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty for participation in 19 holding-up persons, and the Superior Court today dealt with 16 of them in appeal interjections.
Most of the indictees have, since the beginning of the investigation, challenged the charge by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohema Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement between them with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang repaid 30 percent of the larcine to Opava and Koñařík.
The charge refers to the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery whose victims have in most cases suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During home searches, the police discovered unlawfully held pistols, shells with a steel kernel, a laser direct shot viewer or a machine-gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself by tens of millions of kroons.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robbery carried out by Berdych and a whole range of other persons.
Other men in the Berdych neighbourhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived to the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba wants to get from the hospital of Třebíč a compensation of 12 million kroons plus the costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál Hospital disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," said Dostál at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to express an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party has commissioned.
We'll check if this one has some explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands, "said Dostál.
The amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million kroons for every month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a document in support of the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they were faced with remorse for not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on December 9.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region gave each family, at the end of October, 100,000 kroons for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Chequia are subject to civil liability insurance by law.
In the event of a failure, they must draw from the reserve bottom, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
To date, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated on the basis of the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was he who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former actor's collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are sinking over the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching money and developing events, "he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to sneak on our work, "he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, Polívka used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At that time, however, it had no connection with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports of the Valašské Království.
From an original humoristic action it came out a business and a lucrative business activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be cited in the passport and he even offered to the holders balances on the price of his farm visit and his theatre shows.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš has only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the program manéž, for commercial purposes.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up by Harabiš and her team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense manner.
The collaboration between the parties today enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the statement "of King Boleslav first elected forever."
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, asking that the court today rejected.
What could clear the case is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast in besogne.
It would be something like the kings' parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register, "added Harabiš.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also manufacturing could in many respects be described as less than average.
However, at present there is in the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is much better.
All the more so since the combi named SW is going another step further, I have to think more about it.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback I was complaining about, for example, the head space on the back seats.
While there ends the complaints because the combi body means that even the great deities will, in this respect, be comfortable.
Let's go see it quickly.
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I can't repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor.
There, I would have liked a little more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about too short seats or files is over.
Side guidance also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is sensitive there too.
The combi also sees the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk.
The most important thing about this vehicle is his baggage soup.
I have to assess this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and with a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stop elastic which are an ideal compromise.
It is not encombrant and can be extended while being able to hold relatively heavy objects.
But let's stop in the volume.
According to the tables, it makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is relative to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle in this category in Chequia.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, it is found that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, with the difference of 52 litres.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But if I were to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reversal of the files of the perfectly right rear seats, or a very low marchepied.
120 horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, that's what a 1.6 should look like, making a family hatchback work.
He is silent, he consumes little and, above all, he grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot banged by a serpillier, then I can only be enthusiastic of it.
Let's go through the rates.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litres engine at 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
We have in addition to airbags head, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper, automatic control of back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of account 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar figure.
Therefore, only to choose the mark is left.
The integration of Slovenian students into British schools is poorly achieved
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, leading to concerns among the remaining people about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is now facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of original inhabitants are becoming violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where the remaining and immigrant conflicts of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, is a good example of the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicans and bagarres between students have transposed into relations between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who struck a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted her by racist statements.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenagers.
The girls had allegedly sent this man racist remarks and threw stones on him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his butt, "described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovenian students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining has gone so far as to characterize conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the inhabitants of origin and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks come to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovenian students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your leave can be realized if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or then a quiet sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea Islands, you will not find this list in its entirety only, but enriched.
There is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christophe Colomb has qualified her as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the depot and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and carried in Europe.
Then the American era came.
The National Hotel was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, made it build, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under the prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, were circulating on the large bolevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So what about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Nacional Hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still circulating in Havana, since jigoulis and imported fiats have already long ago, in such a salty and wet climate, roasted.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decepted, nowhere else in the surrounding area there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has a green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by the lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sucreries on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and this is how small locomotives, whose contemporaries are not elsewhere only in museums, can be seen on the way.
Where to lead his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most known places.
There is therefore no need to write long on Varadero or on Havana.
If not, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viñales valley west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
Exhausting vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks come up in candle from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile land being taken into their entrals, even its purple rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is the place where you probably grow the best quality Cuban tobacco.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Maybe someone will find it as interesting that this is where it was turned the Chilean episode of Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the market of the slave trade and that of sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has been embodied in the beauty and character of this city-window of small size.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí témětrès nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain massif, is a place so far away that in the 1950s of last century there was no road that would link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We were not building anything, and that's why we were not demolishing anything either, everyone was just having a roof above the head.
If we have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to also see interesting places in the surrounding area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after the sunset and where music is only drained in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some of them refer to this bourgade located in the extreme East of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path ahead.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross high and accidental mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has placed the East Squid of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after the Colomb journey) and from the hill where the old kitten-fort and the current El Castillo hotel is held, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Strawberry and Isla Island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the holy patronne of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled up a lot of pages.
Only, as we just say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passionate, say Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, has an impact on the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not taking place as it should, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops for greater activity this week through Defence Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves, "said British Defence Minister Les Browne to the BBC chain.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent over the past year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand province, located south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop today made similar remarks.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and this is not enough, "said De Hoop to Reuters Agency at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Which is passive
In recent months, there are also conflicts between the countries involved about whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the south and east parts of the country where we operate, "said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun described German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The discoveries of Afghanistan: the Germans play, while our people fight," Sun wrote in a document complemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went to the counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to 1 billion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding CK 84.000 is upon each Czech Republic.
The total debt increased at the end of September to CK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
As a result of a better-than-expected state budget savings, the Department has reduced its planned amount to KKK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic increased towards the end of September to CK 842.7 billion.
In the nine months of this year, it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.3 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its state debt data from early October.
The burden of debt in excess of CK 84.000 is the responsibility of each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted by more than DKK 111 billion.
"At the moment, it appears that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border by only a billion kroons in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one billion kroons, "said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed one billion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political stage was to change, policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change, "he said.
Debts are growing
State debt is made up of central government debt and is mainly caused by the accumulation of State budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by treasure bills, annuity securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the State has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroons.
The State's external debt has increased this year from CK 1.7 billion to CK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable state reached CK 803.3 billion at the end of September and as of June it decreased by CK 13.7 billion.
The average debt liability was 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased between the first and third half of the year by 13 per cent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the rents where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt grows, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matters to negotiate when pension reform comes, "Pikora commented.
Better than what we expected.
As a result, the Government had planned to borrow KK 159.2 billion this year for the year 2007 of the Government's debt financing and management strategy.
At the beginning of September, however, as a result of a better-than-expected state budget savings, the Department reduced its planned amount to KK 152.8 billion.
The sum is mainly made up of the State budget deficit, which will clearly reach CK 76 billion this year, instead of CK 91.3 billion originally planned.
Second, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Peacebuilding Agency, which is 13.3 billion kroons, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of State rents for 43 billion kroons and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's loans amounting to 1.8 billion kroons.
She was standing in a court in Khartoum today for appointing a peanut bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to deportation, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students between the ages of 6 and 7 giving the name of Mahomet to a peanut bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher in office at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday in her home and charged with the abuse of Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints by parents of students to the Ministry of Education of the Sudan.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6 / 7 years of age, to choose a name for the class peanut bear.
"Eight names come out of the mouth of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the director of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as the preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed with the legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear itself had no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons's Muslim colleagues, a teacher in the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was only a "innocent error."
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class."
It should be noted that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given first name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules for the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
It is of course an issue of interpretation.
They failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach a status agreement," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There are no immediate plans for violence, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last visit Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian Ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika had been charged with a new United Nations mediation in August.
The United States and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on further negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of United Nations administration in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina states that it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not rule in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where these "last-chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Commander of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, in particular, that it was doubting a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "it does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
Tuesday, the delegation of Serbia had insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush wrecks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finalizing the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, "said Bush, recalling both parties to their obligations under the" road map "for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided over by Abbas would aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three difficult problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the plight of Arab refugees who have been chased from their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "comprehensive and in-depth" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert is committed to "direct and continuous" future talks and "an effort to close them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the time limit for the implementation of his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli "vision of two states" at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origine of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because he attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saoud in his interview with the Arab-speaking Saudi capital daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate (IGPN) investigation, a police car was running on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m. Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in an intervention but in a patrol, and was running at 40-50 km / h, without gyrophar," a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, so not allowed to circulate on the public track" (read below) and piloted by two young people without helmets, was circulating "very bright."
"She hit the police car on her left, after a right priority refusal," said a policeman.
The control of alcoholaemia on vehicle occupants was negative.
The condition of the car (dark front, storey windshield, rounded bumper) is a witness to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Procurator of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced having entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, cosapsed with the departmental management of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the procurator stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage was overriding the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, some kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foot-hold on the ground, showed that both vehicles remained shaken by the time the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had very quickly left the scene, not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, while remaining careful, would also exclude "any serious misconduct" concerning this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we must be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met an eyewitness from these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows, just overlooking the stage.
"We came down right away, with my cousin who's a nurse at the hospital, trying to reanimate them," said this witness.
There was nothing to do. "
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was working.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young people, the fourth one was talking on the phone. "
Faced with the tension that quickly surround the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty of the people present about the unexpected situation of young people, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also practised heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right now.
Everything was done to try to save them, "said the prosecutor on his side.
The tension goes up to Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter have returned by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have loaded and injured lawyers.
Several of them would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court Bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other events were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received support from religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who voted against the state of emergency and detritus to those who oath before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, she was expected to decide on the legality of the reelection to the presidential office on 6 October by indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evicted and replaced.
"All we are witnessing is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to Supreme Court decisions," said the magistrate in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insisting rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been resided by his Deputy Chief of the Armies.
More than one third of pregnancies remains unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancy is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Contraceptive methods such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has led to better "fertility control," according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Voire calculated in the next month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work to astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew comrades of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky output that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, "tricked" tools by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Discovery shuttle module Harmony, a large cylindrical room to soon host the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of bearings wharf for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was, therefore, to move a solar power generation module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeployment of the solar panels of the module that have a scale of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which flies like accordions, was damaged on almost one metre by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to make a control outlet of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracoler at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of Nasa's best "spacewalker."
Large, resistant, very adroit, it has the very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore asked to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he sectioned the flawed cable and installed some kind of "attels" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" left near the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped with insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bribed" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making an inventory of its tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were enjoying half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to Discovery for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in Bourse
The EADS action is in net decline at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its 2007 operational result forecast as a result of delays caused by the slow increase in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of overcoming the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," announced the EADS European manufacturer's parent house.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further quantified details.
The group also indicated that the estimate of new loads was consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's operational result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the ballot boxes: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
On three days from the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not let it be made clear by receiving foreign ambassadors, simply carrying a new charge against the West accused of interference - its predilection theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and wish for honest, most transparent and open elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from account.
She denounces a campaign with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there had never been such dirty elections, even at the time of Eltsine.
After the repression of last weekend's protests, the former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protests, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspicious legislation are two more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin for the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot hold a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any event, both legislatures and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, went back further: civil society was behind in this Christianity country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has renamed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population all the more because this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic ease," said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility" they had shown briefly after the outbreak of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New liberties imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "What to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen's Nazi archives, which trace the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are free of access.
The 47 million archives, stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. in an individual and nominative manner, on the request of a former victim or his or her right holders.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "including the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public opening of these nominative documents due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their detention, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said in 2006 Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technische Universität in Berlin.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, intra-European bilateral trade already reaches almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact was a great deal for both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange each year for "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services," said President of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, Danièle Smadja, who regretted that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential." The EU and India are meeting Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England expressed its concern on Thursday to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at the basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"To address the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its supply of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she says in a press release.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE puts on the cash market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally one week.
BoE added in its release that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the" day-to-day interbank lending rates "on-line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the Bank of England has put money on the market with a significant penalty rate that has dissuaded banks from using it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the book price in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declines about ten measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the management of the rents.
As UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was lifted following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes vifs, between majority and opposition at a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out
Following many rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the proponent / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has, more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festivals producers.
In 1989 he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
As a "most inspiring event" named Glastonbury, Charlie Jones of C3 said that his company and Melvin Benn were working in parallel to give the region a European style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked assidently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been in politics because of the current administration, "says Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after staging in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a championship festival, while our people are rather taking place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a impression of a championship festival to the European and an urban to the American. "
Vineland is about half-way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of this festival is "very great," like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He said that there had been invitations to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going in the press.
"Vineland will be a rock flavor, but music will be varied there, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
Not easy to attract Hollywoodian film trays to Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "runaway productions."
Is it hard to play in the "Governator" legs?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favourable, she's going to go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best, "he said.
The race at the festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema here.
The Oscars race is started.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, to highlight them and to ensure that the directors are interviewed.
The age of darkness had a beautiful window at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on a stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-premium crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on a stock exchange generally has positive behaviour.
However, it is not necessary to make statistical-based forecasts, since in view of the current context, uncertainties in the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not supporters for the stock exchange to take momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in view of the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to quality values both in long periods and in short periods."
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely drop in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of inflationary tension stimulation"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing," says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension regimes that occur annually during these dates.
However, the expert says that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the constitutional party (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused by the information that is coming from the European Union as regards the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to select the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum sides.
Solana of Intermoney says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date comes near, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they start it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," said the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December was a kisser month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it is successful in computer on its year-end rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8: 30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10: 00 a.m. to 8: 30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that he would like to amplify the hours of his branches, BBVA, even though he has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive in order for other organizations to join this initiative, which coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
Attracting self-employed customers who travel in these areas to buy in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies all over Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but about renovating existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize its existing branches in commercial areas by adapting them to the profile of customers in different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the hours is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others operating under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very large hours, which even open on Sunday and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
"We do not want to compete with our customers," says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value in stock exchange of its rival Antena 3
We made it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate from Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect was detrimental to his joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a low market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished last day with a growth of 2.54%.
This gain has stabilized its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reached the €4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its Antena 3 rival, which has ceded yesterday 1.52% and which has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other comunication companies listed in the stock exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the editor of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do in the same market at what price and how we will cost it in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, the delegate advisor for Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
To ensure that this advertised data is real, the television channel should record a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing over the 965.4 million in 2006 for the current year.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while television net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in Bourse is the important pay out he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early in making a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise to give as little as 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with the 33% Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently giving signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates to 4% in 2008 and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenne's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Ibersecurities recommends the purchase of both values based mainly on its large dividend profitability and long-term sustainable potential.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure that markets operate effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Law on the Market of Values, involves the modernisation of the financial markets, as it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Commission on the Market of Values (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consultation services for specialized social reasons, as well as for natural or legal persons, and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consultation companies (AFI), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for carrying out transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service undertakings to disclose information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and risk management, and to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate control by the NVMC.
By way of the Congress Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that shows that titled debts will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what has happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposing of the management in order to legally delimit the functions that economic graduates may be 30 years of age after the approval of the Royal Decree in 1977, which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, which will not require the authorization of the NVMC and who will be able to lend its product marketing services and attract new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available for publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second vice-president and economic minister Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure," but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has stated in Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to over 50% up to £12.000 million (€16.800 million) since it entered into crisis in mid-September and had to use an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he was raising some record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure that was gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get these remaining 18,000 million pounds to reach the target of 30,000 million.
The Richard Branson magnet group, known for its crardes advertising campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has appointed this week the offer of the Virgin Association, with three other companies involved, including his favorite to save him from the banqueroute.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the murderer town of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption betray discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May, Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the city hall, who according to the sources of the survey consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'leader' of this scheme.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urbanism Council, and the possibility of new stops is not discarded in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption trash, discovered at the beginning of this week, was imputed.
As the SER Chain indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the Member of Parliament 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the trash.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galicia building company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight persons in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidature for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress if the socialists win the general elections.
Thus, the organising secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer made to the former Minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, who made public on 15 November last his decision not to run for the next general elections and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change within the university framework.
The former Minister has recognized that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, even if citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce the one who will preside over Congress, in a "act of transparency."
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make "it more and more resembles the citizens."
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to pretend he was already in his position to not fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents could consider as "a domination."
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subjected to unmerciful persecution of both the sceptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who even plans to sign a "new contract for the planet."
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-implementation, in which sectors has it occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what steps it is going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced to do, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
But there has been no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Coûteuses, inconfortables et menaçantes pour les comptes des entreprises et des individus.
Up to the centiem of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
This means that it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, that do not denounce and that do not require, embellishes meetings and inspire tenderness.
If only this is a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are moving on a bicycle or we are refreshing with the range.
The mayor and head of the local police of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the murderer of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Town Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal adviser was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where at this time many agents met, who also presented themselves to the City adviser function of Urbanism and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil for the urbanization of them so that the Galicia company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which is being investigated by the Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees have now passed to a judicial provision.
According to sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently an autonomous member of the PP party, Juan Morales, is covered by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as was the current fiancée of the former municipal adviser, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Gendarmerie Central Operative Unit (UCO) Urban Delit Group, whose officers, in addition to the stops, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in companies related to detainees in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in sum, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex of the murderer town of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company has acquired to Totana 2.2 million square metres of land that have been reclaimed and its project would involve doubling the population of the commune, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, who deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, who manages Vigo's parking lots in the streets Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, who deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's comment published in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly at the top of PISA information above the world's educational level), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has interpellated public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor's student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy in the high schools. "

A colleague reports on the introduction of crimes into the Criminal Code on downloads on the Internet:
A. The download of a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, flight to a CDs store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The flight to a store for up to EUR 1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is less than that imposed for download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for download (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright without the author's permission is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings that workers' monthly pay generates depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people assumed that they received the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion called for so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of Srebrenica's murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are mortal -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader Serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list, whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes his title, 'the Carla list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the pace of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in Belgrade in New York, who sues the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to shrink the circle.
What insurance do I like?
Automotive insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be provided or use, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
It is that, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the appropriate car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the insurance price, which is based on a variety of factors, such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
For this reason, people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of loss due to their caution.
Similarly, using the censuses, the companies concluded that married persons tend to have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
These are many of the variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best adapts to his profile.
Here we will set out the most significant variables when choosing either type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when entering into a contract with insurance at an accessible price, as may be the low experience in driving and seniority of the driver's licence.
Although the ideal for being well assured is risk-free insurance, other more cost-effective options exist.
The most foreseeable drivers can opt for free risk insurance so that they get coverage from insurance at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the client pays part of the amount of the disaster.
"The portion of the amount of the disaster that the client pays will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the client provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A advice.
If you are a 25-year-old minor, try to be careful and avoid claims to the extent possible, since this will affect the subsidy, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"Bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonus, "Noguera clarifies.
Beyond the 25 years it becomes easier for drivers when making a contract with insurance, since the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the experience accumulated.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose an all-risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the pre-acquired experience after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable that he or she negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation allows him or her to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be people with the lowest rate of claims, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be free-of-risk insurance (up to EUR 300), or extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of premium.
"They have a more casual conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury to assume a greater amount of franchises," Justice Luis Noguera.
For pensioners an insurance at any risk with a franchise is preferable (by being the one of EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of subsidy.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to arrive at the eighth final
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow measure next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in closing the League of Champions, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scottish to classify themselves.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a zero game in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, which has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played one week before the sixth day ends, since the Milan AC must compete the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the December 16 final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the nil game at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better cross in the hindths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this because with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, who have good hope of ranking for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case the Celtic would lose, to rank for the eighth final to be able to continue the league of the UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility to continue European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting is "brilliant."
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the group that was running away in late 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that takes over their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice' 's husband had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's gonna think about the show."
'Sporty Spice' who was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which led to the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the beginning of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw people's feelings changed, Spice Girls' feelings changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision "said Chisholm about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have arranged and we appreciate each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
To begin, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
They have five seven sons to her.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhiberate in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
In Madrid they will flourish on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is throwing the alarm.
A dispute about the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E) are conveyed by pipelines, and each pipe is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases fuel costs, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a decrease in supplies to the US countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's ownership monopoly providing gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50 per cent more for the supply of gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would involve Ukraine, a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most gas transites," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under-developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve the controls to be carried out on its extra-community employees to verify whether they have previous criminal precedents, "said the Control Committee.
The Warning of the Revoir General, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland, was involved in the attack at the Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas people employed by it.
However, his report highlighted other decision-making controls, correctly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The revisor general made controls on extra-community personnel following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after falling down with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at Old Bailey in October because suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff in order to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out controls of previous criminal cases, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Revisor General's report now states that committees are required to face up with the Office of Oversight of Previous Penalties, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some staff information has been verified, this is not done every time." announced the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health is doing most of his own pre-employment controls, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff members is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland stated that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment controls currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1161 overseas persons, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
But the revisor general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revisited upwards, in part because of problems with the identification of staff with indeterminate contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for controls by health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for the overseas staff of the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls for all employees, including overseas persons.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed having arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells manigating an imminent attack on a oil site, as well as attacks on clergastics and armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda's sympathizers have launched a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who infiltrated the country.
They say the activists were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have complotted the assassination of ecclesiastics and armed forces.
The government called on the clerics to do more against the Saudi people headed in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda's activists fighting against the Allied Forces and against the allied Muslim Shiite government in the United States, considered heretic according to the harsh line of the Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi-born Al-Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces over the last five months, "said the spokesperson of the Minister of the Interior on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medine organized into a "media cell" to promote "takfiri thought," the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that support the use of violence against infidels and apostistes Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
The scientists yesterday said that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European ship in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, unlike what we thought before.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and may have even been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation has led Venus to a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and flash storms and has a temperature surface hot enough to melt lead there.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor of the Department of Physics of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are almost similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive equipment, apparently uranium, was sequestrated by the Czechoslovakian and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three people have been arrested and that the equipment is currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the top as a candidate for the presidency, to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican candidates for the presidency finally agreed to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions raised was as ridiculous as that of another debate by You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have very much reflected the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate for the next elections.
It is not known what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose You Tube clips to show the candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-theme issue, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the top subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they would hear some fun things: The government noted increases in approval when the candidates expressed themselves in a coarse way.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his house.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote an "amnesia" (offering clandestine people a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressist, have succeeded in deepening this subject.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and in a more incisive way than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, together with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether to put water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in its entirety in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the history of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee - in position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, he started laughing and said that Jesus is too chic to run for the elections.
The human race remains unsolemnly open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent stunning research of grants by the libertaire Ron Paul, and the whistles in Wednesday's debate.
These two are emerging from nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two party guards are unable to agree to decide who is the more known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party at an early and convincing time with a message of success about the American greatness bringing the leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no parisian hotel bills from politicians, no sucked extra conjugal foot finger.
But there is a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back in his election plan, insulting stupidly British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Staline to Mr. Bean.
The redemption of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the crack, has shown a flaw of directives and a poor judgement in the event of an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative burdening.
A retired trio of generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military expenditures: they proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of rattling donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Workers (and his ex-head of vigilance), made them resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is heading indefinitely towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but in general leave their doubts on their side when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: public administration no longer works; ministers' offices are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any more objective.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot be a beginner.
Although he would like to disregard Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems related to the Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's malheurs, such as the long investigation of party funds "cash for members of the House of Lords," voters might think the opposite.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic that she looks like it.
The gaffes are not so monstruous as members of the Tories party make it believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to realise Mr Brown's Stalinist trends always, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He can have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against anonymity of the large subsidiaries of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the grant collection officer who had spoken about doubtful donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: there is no evidence to suggest that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent president for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to work with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to reconquer the voters, and the only way to get a victory is to demonstrate unforgettable integrity and strong skills.
Cardboard scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see grazing fins, touring around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measure the non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Fees and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States concerning personal banqueroute caused an abrupt fall in banqueroute archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the borrowing conditions were to be worse.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly amount of debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their endpoints now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the cash flow rather than the value of the heritage, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay all of it.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans." said Gary Perlin, Capital One's director.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decrease.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market bring America to the recession, industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful about the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty for Enron.
The three British bankers who were to testify against a fraud committed by the previous Financial Director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusoire fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in the spite of their employees.
They are expected to come to court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of having committed fraud.
The three ex-executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Britain because of the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges made to them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation in Enron's unveiling.
The charges against bankers, known as Natwest's "three" report coming to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to truke the banqueroute procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary to be zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as an interest in this company.
According to the accuse, Fastow has falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was disposing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the British bankers' pockets, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspirations in Enron's unveiling.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is under six-year imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of $1million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly seventh largest national company, in banqueroute in December 2001 after years of accounting tructuring, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bidonic speculations as profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, over $60 billion loss of market value and over $2 billion loss for pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former General President Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death as a result of a heart attack last year.
Not in or out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel autonomy to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, an orgy of consumer incitement, for four days, which is held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of new rich Russians for their various products, ranging from acajou yachts to cars filled with diamonds such as those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer screened a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"it's a pretty car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to a oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists." said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University. "
As the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest dependant.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH president, to exchange ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the list Forbes listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires, which are worth $670 billion in total, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we are all there," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jewelry.
She was first involved in the living room with the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 say they are like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her high-sewing dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The living room seems to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to tail in the corks to come to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinium canyons, Mövenpick ice cream, personalized billboard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund peluche bears.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Gijrath, stationing proudly at the Royal factory stand made of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall board of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling"
In fact, the vendors have stated here that the Russians with old capital (10-15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from shiny logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the living room.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, are surveying the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton encrusted with gold yarn.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that team cars with last-night alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars like bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be encrusted with Swarovski crystals so that it looks like a roulette wheel.
The four-set costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of autruche leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles "
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in this case," he said.
"there's more than you might think."
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company built four stands representing British telephone cabins, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionnaire lounge.
Passengers arrested to throw mass tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this fake wealth or poking a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unassaulted Surgician Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window bay of Just a little Healthier restaurant and was watching an ambulance that just stopped at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unregistered cosmetic surgeon, who the police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for confidence, the results of the toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should allow to resolve this mysterious death that has harmed the high ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenace, "Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and that she left two 14-11-year-old sons, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for the Union County Public Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"This is an opportunity to consider."
"the investigation is continuing."
The authorities reported that they arrived at her house around 3: 00 p.m.
and found Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
Wednesday, no one opened the door from Melle Castro where a pissed rosier lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a dalmatian aboyed in the back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for fragrances, was housed in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her to sail into the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"she said," you have to pay attention to this, "he said.
"she was there when I arrived, and again when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates related to the effervescence of the world stock exchange.
The shares are exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market was hoping that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements by the vice-president of the US central bank.
The stock markets explode in Londrès, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in agitated financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has in part "reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this severe turbulence persisted, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that subsequent interest rate reductions could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the American economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercutions of this financial tumult were accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losers of real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in Londrès where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, or 2.55%, reaching 13.289.40, while the largest index, S & P 500, took 2.65%.
In Londrès, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, leading to 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the recurrence of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a monthly three-month auction from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject later funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions, has made the "Libor" monthly three-month borrowing rates the British banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, to 6.59% following a strong rise since 12 November.
England faces an appeal against the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the # 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the sellers who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President General of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
He who will not be able to win dossard 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to wipe out what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never go beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
It is not just cricket that the selection is difficult, because at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to get Bopara out of here?
Is it just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only one place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket unless we give him at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket of a day.
But capturing the eyes of the sellers is much more complicated.
Many better done last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison was in full shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 towers to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also fighting to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketor of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double cent marked against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the innings of the Test 88 in Bombay, 32 cents first class compared to six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the sellers when Vaughan again in shape, demanded his place for the next game, seems to have affliged his elves so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently capped on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He only carried away light injuries, was shocked, even if the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who looked at him from far away, to ask him if "he had seen that?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his tireless look allows him to make services that fit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the just man is one thing, choosing the right moment is another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection?
I would be able to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, overthrowing those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normalcy.
Some have come back to fight against the activists who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported to dozen official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seen that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of the ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the area of Amariyah dominated by the Sunni, returned with his two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia, allowed him to hunt Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his house north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing bachelor of the capital since the American troops arrived, and in view of the continuing training of well-armed "groups of involved citizens" working with American military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, expressed all the suspicion about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, would have asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
"we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni retirees.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been chased out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There is concern that a sudden flow of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is in the field of vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - it is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Sarre, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already in tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This shows the high quotity of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Sarre also leads children from the country to higher than average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," said Axel Plünnecke, IW training expert.
More than one in five young people obtained their qualifications in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In view of the number of people, the double course panel is Germany's second best.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced higher schools to have a marketing campaign in the sciences subjects of the engineer.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools." said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is free of law - a model that, in the meantime, other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies can show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In PISA studies in 2003, the quotity of at-risk students decreased from 29% to 20%.
In total, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federated states.
Bavarian people are getting better.
And in the great spite of sarrois, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could win points in this area.
For the neighbor's language is compulsory in the lycées - even if the sarrois are not French.
Chávez rules watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be tac other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring up the half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
In the meantime Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the official Venezuelan newspaper communicated, as a result of a new law, watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified its position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage case.
The left nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian government.
"I cannot, already only because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the negotiating mandate for the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spit in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all the buckets.
A new mobile phone ringing is fuelling in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you not shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interpellations of the left populists and who told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong situation, according to a pronostic, a real lower value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts cited all kinds of reasons for their pronostic pessimist.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low wage development, the increase in the value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy and Business Research, in the journal "Bild."
New charges for unemployment insurance could also be incurred for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected fall in unemployment insurance by 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credit or financial aid, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level over the past 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind pears with poles, like those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" probe today has provided proof of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus breaks out at about 56 kilometres of cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature."
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: thunderstorms would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there has been a life, it must have been at a very old date of history," says Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should now be little living things on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times more dense than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no more probe was on the way for the exploration of this planet since the eighties.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more than supposed to be at first.
As a result, the researchers found, in addition to the wind peatlands already known at the North Pole, a peaty of clouds at the South Pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost as large.
The planet called an evening or morning star turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has set on Earth as carbonate, it is on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party dispute about the reception of Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about Germany's appearance and summons the great coalition to close the dispute about the reception of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler said to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures," Köhler said.
We all know that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, "said the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new China policy.
The German Chancellor did not take away from the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows it," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly made his dissatisfaction about the Dalai Lama reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "devanture policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese government has not only deordered the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel reports, has also frozen the so-called foreign ministers' strategy dialogue.
The head of the Government of China Wen Jiabao now requires German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the reception of the Dalai-Lama was an error.
China refuses European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, thus supported Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of Dalai Lama would show that it is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fighting with police, fire, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break up in the streets by violence, "said the German Minister of the Interior.
Burning barricades, shotguns shooting on the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not form itself at home as well and defuse into violence.
We must take this seriously, "he said at the" Nine Press "in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get away with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings have burned.
More efforts to integrate the German government were required by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects."
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment quota for young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be above average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families was taking place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should "quickly be given the opportunity to participate in work and training."
Meanwhile, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlamps.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burnt cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has been taking place.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the unrest was in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopic stage of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing to wait for from her.
What country does that chancellor live in?
After her dissolving intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, we must say: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of too much focus on politics has been pushed away by Angela Merkel from a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what criticism wants.
In Parliament, it has made visible to all the extent to which this reproach was correct.
There was no concrete interest or little feelings for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela presented himself as a cloud: a politician in a bearings, who flees in foreign policy and even there remains in the near.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, the self-praise - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it again two years ago.
Now it cramponns to all-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
By this it destroys its image of pragmatist, which resolves the problems rather than embellishing the world.
But in the empire of the cloud Angela, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few other sentences left for this.
In this regard, it is indicative of the number of times she makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to give a clear half sentence.
She's tibing in unknown field, from the moment it gets concrete.
The Attack branch
In the debate of Youtube of Republican candidates to the presidential, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a hard offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already exhausting on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestine," reproached Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He against him by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a refuge for clandestine people," Giuliani replied and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are coming up to the attack: as the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users sent via Youtube are just more than blower.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," throws John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Romney is also given a strong lesson by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding," a method of interrogation where drowning is masked.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause is moving into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of both favorites are again revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrit and apologizes to the base and the television audience for still being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a sliding node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the armies, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination end.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday he had transmitted his charge as Chief of the Armies to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus folded up with international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as a head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decided on November 3.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers on his ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of State on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany in the seventies replay: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return have been published records of their great success "Live 1974."
Already at that time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced to the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, throne in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, 57-year-old, in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by all the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, is curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including even a Beat.
And sometimes it is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the Harmonia group is playing again has provided a few months of experience among Krautrock's lovers.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys show that, of course, the name is reasoning in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so durably so that this group has been so painful for 32 years.
But why would German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
All the more so because what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has always rained in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the Cologne Can group survivors for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric eloge, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed two years and during this period the power of impact that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlinois scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly outdated Kraftwerk and finally made himself a name as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
Around 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forets.
There, in an old farm of the Weser, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Soi-saying was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art
A lot of Harmonia is away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia," and the following "De Luxe."
For as serene and small as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not used alone in search of self.
The CD "Live 1974" that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks it is.
Rother at that time expressed the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esoterism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (flaming hearts).
Cluster resurrected in the eighties and has had more success than Harmonia had ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been deterred on this occasion as Roedelius's personal work.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The Woldtronics Festival was publicly subventioned.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be cerned towards future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence in the room in the middle of singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front of us, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to shoot the instruments from the unheard sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three in great technical fignolders.
To that even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we couch and whispered under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never about rock.
Roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the leak of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia too is now no longer being irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can type on someone's nerves (?) or give fugaces moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace," two films again address the Balkan War.
But both are not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchange of foolish shots or on the contrary they are too lush.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely there, in the most lugubre hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because much too many nice and foolish roles in women's feelings films and much too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism ravaged him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to still watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunt (why do today's films have to be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a beautiful representation full of clins of eye: at the bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderous Peace," which also comes out this week, the endless suite of missed films on the Balkan war.
A "murderer peace" can be done quickly: the film talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of Kusovar freelancers, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the serbs are not presented for once as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost much too quickly in the action and exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can look into the perfect example of "The Hunting Party," why in substance there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to pister the high war criminal "the fox," could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now."
Because the stories are striking: two males go as a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do, and for both males, it becomes a trip in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, is able to have NATO, the CIA and all the world's premium hunters failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave it for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized of a crime against film logic.
In this case, the film has a human concern too deep.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreed) not to lead the hunting in a sufficiently intensive way due to secret political agreements.
But the intentioned good and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
He talks about a wooden mask from an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the front inflated, clearly: as it is tiring to be bad."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films on South Africa yet.
What is worth every time: when a star dragged on a crisis home or on a mine field, he then came out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have always passed before Hollywood can run a good film on the holocaust with "Schindler's list."
Some films still have to mature - those that are now worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were under no circumstances unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know about the world's conflicts today, where every heecatomb arrives live on two screens at home at the same time,
And it ravaged the writers the lack of scrupules they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" actually became as good as it was because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we must have the sarcastic and distanced artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he said, "It's only because some things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered in an awful way and the war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is collecting criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiades.
The mayor's backlog with Hamburg's nomination for the Summer Olympic Games has been confronted with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
The chief director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described Wednesday as "bad for the local economy."
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find it a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday at his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides to apply for the Olympiad, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" said Von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, about Munich's application for the 2018 winter games.
This preference means for us that, in the time we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance. "
However, the dream does not belong definitively to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
The impression would be that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, by bury the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the application would be further in contradiction with the statements made by the head of the Senate during the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first named Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor's SPD fraction accused the Senate of not having used this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympiades and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiades and a later use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor."
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' boxes.
The one who connects Sweden's concepts with wood box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden put shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the eighty-ten "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxs listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today results in a disenchantor result: the six "Brillo-Boxes," whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum made a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm," which are circulating on the international art market.
Ancient history is encircled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes," painted wood boxes in New York, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: These were not from (for financial reasons) Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cartonnage factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, exposure samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wood boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time today talk about about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered law into the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol allowed, with the name "Type Stockholm."
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum mistakenly claimed that about 100 wooden boxes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have given him.
In fact, the 105 Hulten boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
On that date, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservative of the Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections, including two made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and punctured, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies that date from 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on stratified panels, using a roller of paint - in addition, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official Brillo-Boxes list," says Moderna Museet's director, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will clasten the six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powder soap boxes.
But since then we have had an inexorable silence over there.
The Rebellious Soldiers of Manila are abandoning
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same who had cut off at a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
The power-faithful soldiers had soon taken the hotel to attack with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were held in court on Wednesday due to a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the hearing to suddenly sneak out with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were normally to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command of the Ranger Scouts' elite unit, said that other military units are soon to join the march.
The criticism of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by the reproaches of corruption.
The financial district of Manila has been the theatre of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven putsch attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per share is €14.46, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a redemption before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we are looking to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market, "said United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would hold the money only for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a participation of almost 10 percent in the Drillisch mobile telephony company.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed on the stock exchange 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson for United Internet.
Both companies established MSP to absorb the Freenet competitor.
At the moment, both companies want to feel satisfied with their ten per cent participation at Freenet, and not to use their right to support an additional 18.49 per cent at Freenet, confided United Internet on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, particularly to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still hard-to-predict poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL and full subscriptions.
The United Internet Holding and Drillisch held a 6.01 per cent direct participation in Freenet to date.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide about four per cent more.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
