At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange bascula in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange recited its losses.
Transactions with the ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange began to fall with its fall of the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares at Wall Street.
The market's response to the result of the US House of Representatives' vote, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is thus also perceptible in our country.
Decrease of shares in Asia
The Asian fellowships on Tuesday saw a dramatic fall, even if the clues managed, during the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during trade, but later it collapsed some of the losses and reduced the decrease to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese share movement of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but finally it was possible to reduce the losses to 4.3 per cent.
According to his index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the USA will influence the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hongkong is part of China, he sets out his monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hongkong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be possible for other countries to be affected.
The blood bath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have allocated up to $700 billion (almost 12 gallons of Kč).
The legislators thus denied the call to support President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a blood bath and the main indices of actions had the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, with a fall of this size for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress ceda: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the US financial assistance agreement.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (about KK 12 billion) financial assistance to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan for the financial system will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Said Sunday to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the House's Banking and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, by Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reanimating financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "disillusionment."
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions about the form that the package of measures should have for the stabilisation of the market, "confided the Bloomberg Agency the Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
In her view, the final vote could be taken as soon as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, to give the government a final form.
It should redeem from financial companies the invendable real estate assets that lead to considerable losses for financial enterprises and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this plan for market recovery, but I think we are there, "said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining equity markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, the legislators are not avoiding Harry Reid, so that Congress can reach a final agreement as soon as Sunday.
In this way, they want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hourly area, where Congress's decision could influence Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is not possible to clarify with certainty when the two Chambers of the American Congress will vote, or if the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there are still many changes to the law.
The total amount to be used by the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount by following two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President can put his vows on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the repurchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was happy with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators had agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the relief agreement, the course of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of the said golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program, and it establishes a committee, which will monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides support for real estate owners who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new payments in the case of mortgages it will redeem, while at the same time reducing debtors' monthly rates and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the Chief Economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of the mechanism and price of redemption of problem assets.
This point will be decisive in deciding how to share losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week at the iHNed.czserver.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is, according to Marek, not as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmans agree, from this week on, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this moment, "Marek said.
A strong struggle to the extreme: MP3 readers against mobile.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While almost all motives can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems to be a clear result that only one phone should be purchased.
This means that there are sufficient reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end gramophone to put up Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disk, and from the point of view of quality there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you are at least probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just like a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty withholding listeners purchased for 20 crowns in the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is broad.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music readers are capable of much more than just a music reading, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most motives.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to read music and films, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if we take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost seeing a miracle.
The universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The greater the number of functions you use, the more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfers.
Rare motives who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are much more performing.
In the case of cheap mobile, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you sometimes call from time to time, get yourself, to be safe, a second recharge for work - this being valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, as a result of reloading, to operate continuously for at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need any software, except for iPod.
Simply fill out the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most motives and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, motives have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, focus on the life of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and sound output type and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Almost all motives are capable of this today.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All are able to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have this format.
It is one of the most common formats, and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
AAFC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile also allows, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough to visit the corresponding operator's (or other supplier's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for obtaining a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases is limited to radio tubes made quickly.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, Internet or even wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their motive on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have listeners on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated enclosures, which almost all mobile ones have, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of music motives is their price.
Cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand kroons, we can have a already very suitable walkman.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed 15 thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone can ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily match the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
What device to choose
Even the cheapest motives (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even if you take into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kroons.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive are even out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 kroons.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, rather choose specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and so the ease of control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobile has the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by a MP3 player produced by one of the marks mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win Chequia this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Chequia is relatively advanced, with our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned, on many occasions, the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office, which reported that the price of a SMS was higher at home than in the rest of the Union, confirmed that.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming royalties regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of cheaper Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Chequia remain so high in comparison to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÄ), who has repeatedly stated that in Chequia there was no place for another operator, is choking with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently not very lucky (by the way, now it would find it difficult to find frequencies).
There is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators had to respond as well.
However, even before the entry of party trouble such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those that are heard today at home were allowed to be heard in Britain.
However, it became apparent that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In only six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, the U: fon in Chechen.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They are free from relatively high construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network.
For example, virtual operators worldwide are profiling as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, building on an unusual target group can also be a good call for publicity.
This operator is specifically targeted at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesperson, is in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services. "
In Chequia, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in Chequia, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the successful expansion of this project, but in Chequia the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries of our area, "said in a telephone entretient for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the financial group Penta.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in Chequia are in any case not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their utmost to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real Telefonika competitor in the field of business customers, has not hid, for a long time enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations, "said the spokesperson for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
The future may therefore be promising.
Unofficial information suggests that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not think there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us, "said Vlastimil Sršeengen of the Telefonika O2 press department, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is almost excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement. "
Vodafone rather directs his attention to the completion of requests to obtain his own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the point of view of clients.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile Internet. "
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to be understood as a fair larvae. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U: fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÄ, when the U: fon was created, was that of T-Mobile.
This is reflected by information made available to the public from the ČTÄ web pages.
Today, however, U: fon is ready to be used as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition in the mobile market has also been recently amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would submit it, and above all its services, to high requirements. "
But given the attitude of mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of ČTÄ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately has no power in Chequia to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
In the face of this problem, however, he adopted his typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at this time, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not, a priori, been of sufficient interest to conventional operators, "said in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
A declaration made in this way would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an Office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than disgusting.
All the more so as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
Pressure for the fair functioning of the market and for lower prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which is the result of their reactions.
The question, if this is really a chance, arises naturally.
Similarly, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the random and hard fight of competition.
"In this regard, the Office has not identified signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and none therefore has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably not even available to the telecommunications regulator, "said Chaloupa in his statement.
One of the many points of discord is the interpretation of the dominant position in the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÄ, according to which telecommunications is, from an economic point of view, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
However, some law experts offer another vision: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on his network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators operate visibly in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Reflecting responsibility over the ČTÄ is a rather common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes its hands on the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the new telecommunication law, recently adopted, was not successful in expanding the powers of ČTÄ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This means that the representatives of the ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests appear to be elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price list for mobile telephone services, but they are only in part public.
In most cases, there is a question of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
For example, special mobile services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally reach only elected members.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company is in front of the operator figure of a conventional customer company, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important client, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and which could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not been reached to the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
Auncun operator, however, does not rule against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them significant benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický states the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a percentage of customers negligible.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully have it, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators. "
This is precisely what should seem strange at ČTÄ.
In addition, there is another question to the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers in order to be able to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in service prices.
However, virtually in all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators were trying, sometimes more, or less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - a market too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulators in developed countries, who defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers, took place.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they finally obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the form of a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of our experiences, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable to them in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the crack.
If the slippery information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at home, the Czech mobile market may return to movement.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain impassible in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of others.
And we may cease calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is made by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymn's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.czserver.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that we can understand the words, which they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate next year its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde domov můj was first held in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theater of States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of Savetiers), a Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet naturally became an integral part of the national hymn.
He remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
The pragois public transport (MHD) will introduce, Wednesday, the chip into their ticketing system
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will climb in the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it recorded on their smart card in the information points and offices of Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons by internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz. http: / / www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who are starting to use the online store can definitely forget the guichets at the metro stations, where they had so far to pietinate impatience in long tails in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon by internet and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained staff, which will help those involved with internet purchase and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesperson for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automate will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automates that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just introduce the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the central Bohema communes to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the transport hours in the pragan public.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's body.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the body.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to record coupons on the map.
This is where information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
Sudetes called for a referendum in the USA
In 1945, Sudanese Germans called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudanese Germans allegedly addressed the US President with such a desire.
This is the result of a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter ask the American President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is heartfelt."
Since the rally to Czechoslovakia is presumably promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, untenable attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for vengeance of "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the USA doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the USA, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it clearly illustrates the expectations of Sudanese Germans at the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them had such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the marine in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, Czech would be beneficial to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war felt that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that plans to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš řebíček's office is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She wants to touch the awareness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The phrase "You don't think" is placed in capital on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood flask, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers, "said Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
In his view, the safety signs for drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it is likely to merge quickly with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, expressed support for the return of almost all the occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, or even all," said Olmert on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be done," he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, when several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he later stressed.
Golan Heights Retirement
Olmert was also in favour of Israel's retreat of the Golan heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq, "said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the coach of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, arises the question whether stewards and passengers can travel during the journey inside the bus.
"If the law is to be respected in a strict and formal manner, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the road to the bus.
The girl was at this time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
The bus can have an accident or even a sudden brake, also at the time when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing or non-standing seats.
If this standing seat equipment is not approved, the passengers shall remain seated.
The long distance coaches Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with with the department and, at the beginning, it prohibits any travel of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey provided they have their own seat, "he unveiled his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the steward role - there is no legal requirement for that role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define his rights and duties, "added spokesperson Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"Everything depends on whether the bus has permission in its approval to offer standing seats.
It's all in there, "he said.
The coaches are divided into urban areas, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, long distance with standing seats and a higher permitted speed and long distance without standing seats with the highest maximum permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, said an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) safe in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic there is no danger. The situation can be compared with that of service in aircraft.
There too, it is not sure when a turbulence will occur and the air hostess can hit his head. "
"However, in the event that the coach would have abruptly freed, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements, "he said and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He's hiring two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their trade as a risk business.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I feel that this is a at-risk job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and paper on board.
This would also reduce the costs, "he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hotels, and we have been against them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident, "he said, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived.
A young hostess from the Plzeengen region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably leaked the emergency stop band without using flashing and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he grabbed it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but as regards financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details about the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"However, it has not led to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, at maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone in the wheel, "said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, specifying that control of the safety of the coaches is under the power of the police and the office for safety at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldordays are based on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf Financial Institute with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could be formed, according to the mail made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "skill block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
In all, such a relationship could be a decisive blow to other concentrations in the Länder banks sector.
This is what it looks like when an executive committee wishes to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under strong pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervision Authority that made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westfalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas said during the presentation of the semester figures at the end of August that he did not see any sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a land bank, either the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the Länder banks and by the cash unions, has entrusted the Steering Committee with conducting talks with the WestLB for joint business activities.
This could then be the flow of or parts of the financial market.
However, the talks have just begun, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial place, is involved in the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland Palatinate land bank and the Halbab.
Nothing has yet come out of this eternal bouquet.
Barely the plans had been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse was acting against any participation of Hellaba in them.
The other two houses did not come together either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the square at the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new tractations about the consolidation of Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had however ruled against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavaria Land Parliament election has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Land Bank could be realized first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, potential partners were gradually escaping it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
Hesse-Thuringe's group of savings and transfers, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain at rigour.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, which commercial model should ensure the future capacity of the banks of the Länder, had not been resolved so far by the German group of cash and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb peacemaking could take place, a peacemaking that is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is referred to in the letter from the Executive Committee in place: in any event, a 'comprehensive solution' for the establishment would be considered.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a barrel of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, is held a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena sneaks Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 11: 45, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled for arrival at 6: 30 am.
Three buses are reserved above all for Italians, in one of the buses traveling the Brazilian exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing out and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who is wearing a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three rides just this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10: 30.
Overnight would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco has made a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are running in the night on the Autostrada direction 'Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Rapidly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
This is better so, they will still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates again take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6: 30 as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses from across Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are meeting, Marco holds one last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: Hairdressing the small yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left 'Beer Day', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco 'conoscersiviaggiando.it. "
Second: 'When the doors of the beer chapiteau open, we run', shout Marco in the early morning.
'Run! 'Run and book the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, or we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to split them into the room! '
The chope, shouting Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consigne!
'Show security officers that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone! '
Third: 'Tonight, have come back here at ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's it, we're on our way to the beer party.
On the way, someone kills yellow caps to trees to find the way, signs and even an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer party, known as the 'Italian weekend'.
There are no specific figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are running through the Alps and collapsing into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come exprès from Italy this weekend.
The munichoise police are strengthened by seven South Tirol police officers, by Italian voluntary rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross who realise statistics on countries where Italians are first in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrian (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, said the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and he slipped that the German banker sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This has indeed happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate finance Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side of the DAX, gets a one-billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid appropriations are issued up to €35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter-company is the one that bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state finance had been refunded in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which has been no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had also been slightly lower from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period in the previous year, zero, the profits from the allocation of specified debt and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And only because of the significant benefits of repaying the downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies, the deficit of earnings of about 16 per cent has proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former State financial had first misspeculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been trapped to the Aareal bank.
Because traditional state financing was not cost-effective enough, Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the girl-company, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciations that should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect that still remains rather blurred.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state investor and infrastructure since Depfa's repurchase.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market since it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again been very late, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing medium for a part - about EUR 50 billion - of all Depfa credits annually.
According to a Hypo Real Estate press release, the group's need for funding is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets that are largely out of service at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of HRE Georg Funke's Executive Committee explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Supervision (Bafin) are based on the principle that the Hypo Real Group's capacity in the market is now being ensured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have only to hope.
However, in view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the insolvency gates on Sunday at the end of the evening, this at least temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The share price fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While debt to the first place has barely moved, second-level loans are falling.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo girl company and those of course who have a life beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation placement, and now their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banker system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself which brought the crisis into the institution by the repurchase of the Depfa bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, one can assume a resorption of the shields over time.
Or will happen what no one is hoping for right now - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching sweetness has now become a simple, well-founded hope.
This should place insomnia nights first of all on long-term creditors as to whether they must separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn a trait to defer losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of automatically levied stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to show up for the first day at the Highschool in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of trade, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school was scaring me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train for 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't lose myself.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as we have in Lower Saxony.
The students appear after each other from eight hours, until at nine hours less twenty, a table tower starts with the teacher, the "home room."
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all like talking to people, especially a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue up socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit so, I came before the pupitre, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low buttocks, puffed to laugh and made signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him already because of my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage."
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent must sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all went out their Bento.
My foster mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox to me - it's really other than the miserable German case.
I had aromatic herb rice, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit, and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What's sure is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the confite salty plums, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better the boy's knowledge during the break.
I read that in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could see him here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it makes me feel good, what"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've been favouring for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach flee in the face of danger, does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how could we check that he's feeling the same when he's behaving in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge," contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think you are true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we will enter difficult-to-practice land because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in front of a danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it does death, leaks or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduct a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make transposition of our experience subjective to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
At least therefore for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could be in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, it often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would probably influence it, so that animal consciousness, regardless of how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to analyse on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that's exactly what happened in short-term primates' memory studies, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have followed, we focus more on nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result then for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its suites, such as body reactions) wrecks from the live memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to cortex regions that characterize primates and especially Man.
Subtle degrees of the felt, associated with our volubile nature, are emerging, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar to attribute them to others than ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of the body sensation of the Cortex and the cerebral trunk, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the cerebral trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in cross-cutting sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think that is unthinkable.
Pankseep argued that what is like fear in men and rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could one still check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees in front of danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviour is not enough to prove identical lives.
Of course, nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar cerebral trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how could we show it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their sensations are likely to be completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is glowing nervously as the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries. "
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after time.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed, "said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has us constantly in the eye."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent director.
The Commission met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a mail to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league were convicted, already in the previous season, for handling mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid unleashed counter-attack
She wanted to make a promotion for a new film, spoke about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywoodian star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her ex-adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He squirts - and counter-assaults.
A late Rose war for the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engaged in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis was for a long time unfaithful to me, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be "Monstruous," he said at the "New York Daily News," 54 years old, that "Meg once again wins the history of our relationship and manipulates it."
It would be more "regrettable," that "the punishment and upheavals of divorce for each child are again ravaged in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack. "
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the coup: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's best. "
Air ticket and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The hotel flights and nights would have become more advantageous - this is the result of a study by the financial service provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its first half of 2008 bookings data and, after a price increase in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than one year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "desire for downward travel by American tourists."
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with an increase of 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in kerosene prices, economic class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-term flights, which were very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economic class banknotes fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price changes were significantly less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices are, on the one hand, a sharp economic growth, "explains the firm.
The demand would give rise to land in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure on competition from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the suppression by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines who would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach 1: 0
With simple purpose and methods, the VS Hamburg becomes the first of the classification.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find an eleven functional.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Catastrophic landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late in the game and his shot was unsuccessful against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," whistle Hermann Rieger in the locker hall of the Hamburg arena.
There was not much going on in the locker room, half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, having a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg Martin Jol's chief coach.
Of which orders seem to have been similar: and that it jumps with this second goal!
The practice has failed.
"It wasn't all very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "also wanted to be more relaxed."
This 1: 0 (1: 0 in half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head hit by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate this Monday its 121 years.
Already Saturday afternoon, supporters were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to get back," said Marcell Jansen.
He doubted that the intermediate result of the table reflected more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals engaged - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen unleashed from FC Bayern - is certainly forming gently, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, fear is running.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan has temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
At around 8: 30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.

The most losers of Dow Jones were at that time American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could return any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs's shares were down almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid once, but gradually.
In return, the Crown should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in conjunction with the course's evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
The prices of the actions aspired in the tourbillon in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The course of the action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and draws the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state-planned financial market.

Dark material influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
The experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of fuel conductions soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarking among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they get an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what the researchers have been surprised for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of how they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Much more, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
To date, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attracting force of matter due to space curvature, could not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believes that Einstein was not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently originates from her an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientific calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
The tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are visibly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television channel and the Italian media have communicated in concert.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages were released.
We are checking their health, "said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italian and Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian followers are doing well and safe, said Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants in the trip to the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shootout before the hostage was released remain blurred: for example, kidnappers were reportedly close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to the words of an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom, "said the agent.
There was nothing left but to collect hostages, "when suddenly" this surprise "occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had slaughtered six of the kidnappers in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt this Sunday, and had arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers found a safe road to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abus of a stepfather who "led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stithians, in the Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after having admitted eight charges for indecent assault.
The Truro High Court referred that he regularly lied his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached her and banished her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s, and he returned to live in the Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer assiduous of National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, appeared to be "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father who had also written a letter of confession that ended: "I attached him and banded her regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetish, your victim must certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more surprising is that if she had not made this gesture, her story would certainly never end in court. "
He added: "I point out in particular, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime on Stephanie for years.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office's ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, known the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train towards Waterloo.
The documents are in the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC's correspondent, Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is, the clause dealing with the backup of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained appreciation for Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies in front of B & B. invoice
The British companies in the building may have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys' mortgages are released.
But the interest that will at the same time increase will be debited each year to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the invoices of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaims that each corporation must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will amount to £450million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Companies Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have been cautious in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for institutions much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess options to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salty invoice," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the invoice either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to raise the wholesale price of her milk, from five penny per litre, from Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and occurs following research by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether to go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been last varied in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was refused bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to give her bail because she was under review for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's always rival, was relinquished on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the League Awani, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give it its full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, "said a former leader of the Awami party.
It was held last year after the interim military government took over power, but was released in June to take care of itself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she said she was not able to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
A United Nations spokesperson said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstrue thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV 's judicial battle
BSkyB lost his trial following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares raised doubt about ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB relegated that forcing her to reduce her shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive - especially since BSkyB has just renounced her voting rights.
New investigation into the case of American prosecutors.
The US Advocate General appointed a special accused to verify the dismissal of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
This was the result of the report of the Department of Justice's Inspector General's case, which criticized the actions of certain departmental officers.
The report was critical to White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the case of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special accused Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious charges of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accused capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the removal in December 2006 of nine US prosecutors by the US Department of Justice.
At that time, the department had stated that the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But he then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to give these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Congress Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate charges of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
American prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of departmental officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General was very critical of Mr. Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as a leader, "realizing remarkably not to be involved in this case.
Other departmental officers, including Bush's former collaborator Karl Rove, were critical for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honoured.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award award party is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranked in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name - has suffered from health problems in recent years, even under an operation to heal his heartbeat that became irregular, after collapsing on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal ropes.
A Somber Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Be Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-standing local residents do not know how to go to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dust alley rather than an active artery.
No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirators.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirators, including long-standing neighbours, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house pad.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of Neighbourhood Owner Committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, "said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose rehabilitating and managing it, what Avalon could do, but we wish to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer will conceive space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesperson, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner of the street.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relooker this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale. "
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation of the Real Estate, confirmed that the city was willing to sell the street, further stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colourful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been wearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, re-opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"this place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, hooks, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes. "
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about the evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rush - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Nostalgic Amely Regard on A City in the Extinction Process"), reports the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow, dark, day and night ass, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and parsley, full of newspapers last week that fly along the drops."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs down the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, a 22-inch empty beer bottle, lies next to newspapers that just have been thrown away.
Some passagers said that they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "took place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former study member in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "not as good as You do. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of the Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language class instruction other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students in this school are Hispanic and low-income.
More than one third of students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Of CM1 students, 100% have passed the 2008 State Maths exam, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-of-art exam.
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street uses analyses, practice, a constant assessment of capacity and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, "says Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street," this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion."
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without her class, you would have had no chance of identifying her."
"It works," she notes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools that are made up of the majority of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his huge support for bilingual education, obscure the pronostic of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he was in favour of the fact that immigrants were learning English, Mr Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclama that we must all stop polemying on the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary," he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should look carefully at the educational models that work, rather than disdaigning them or considering them insignificant.
Chute Nette du Pétrole suite aux Nouvelles Inquiétudes du monde de l'Economie
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan for financial steps will succeed in regiving life to the economy.
The final operations of crude oil, fell by 7 percent arriving to $99.80 per barrel. The Mercantile New York Stock Exchange, during this morning's sales.
The prices have fallen by more than $20 at the barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, raw material markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial agitation, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After a July increase of $145.29 per barrel, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before bouncing again in view of the deep uncertainties in financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will be lasting.
In the most recent episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will purchase Wachovia Corporation's banking operations," said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said that this weekend's frantic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement "seem to have failed to bring the market back to life."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the potential for overall equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors. "
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The Bank's analysts reduced their expectations next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, was therefore forced to decrease by 20 per cent, the 2009 oil and gas price forecasts.
The Second Time Determinant Day for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets Shaun Ellis's uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when one corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from half-time.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We were communicating extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense was battling the Cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, back corner, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best Jets could have scored in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said" the second time or the third time? "
When we told him both - the Jets left 21 points indisputable in the third temps- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie resettled, exceeds his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best cross-country rider of the century, after having beaten his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2: 03: 59 from an accommodating race on the dish, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2: 04: 26 last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, from the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, feared - may be exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promoted to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny time, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the back - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The runway riders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into cross-country riders, have contributed to the decline in marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered from mollet cramps two weeks before, and missed training for one week.
It is clear that rest allowed him to stay shiny, but not rusty.
"I am so happy," he told the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best. "
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - for having too much orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hare as if they were in a runway competition, and considering more the world records than the sense of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselassie's capabilities as a background rider.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. mid-way.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to defy Gebrselassie after the headers had disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach from Kwambai, which ends second in 2: 05: 36, improving his best five-minute personal record.
Kamathis came third in 2: 07: 48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2: 19: 19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, Mikitenko 36 years old, surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She could not take part in Beijing's games because of a hypothetical wrong back, but promoted to win in Berlin, improving to her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a hard strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a good advantage, then exceeding them about 18miles ½ later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2: 25: 01.
In a City-in-a-Part, the Orgueil and the Tests of Black Life
Caché in the development of its immense park, just a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet small city where the pride and complications of the Afro-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood house, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison. "
It has now become a city of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city it decrees - has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, doesn't know what he loses."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign look.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident who has always been the oldest parish in the city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model for taking power of black people and a community of almost 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a sudden black rural culture - a few times disdainted, other times acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, that everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Wonderful as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"past the road to the left," she writes, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can be used for people who go through.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not like it."
We always remember Hurston as a live and eccentric person, who was frequently returning after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, reported that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many mocked her.
"people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swing in his chair of the postinner patio that gives over Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plate for the general public.
I don't think they understand the contribution or legacy she gave to the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a 2003 Hurston biography.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to have a five-lane motorway in town, to replace Boulevard Kennedy, a two-lane main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just back from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among so many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute about the mixing of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white young people came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady even died."
They launched a watershed from their car. "
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we were kissing our master in the morning, and in the evening too" said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Community of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's a blanc- I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive herself of the pleasure of my company!"
It goes beyond me. "
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American guns.
The motorway project arrived just as the most famous girl in Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January, to commemorate it.
After many years, the tale has pushed the proposal from the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane motorway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summarized the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-resident people, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who attended our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (well known of course Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repavé.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a rear street later on a day of summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(there are now 90 percent black)
The strangers who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and some chos- such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the championship - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the bright red, are always afraid that their insular community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his whole race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, working, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon 11 years old, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly the description Eatonville.
"Most people who go through this area will think:" oh, this city has not compared anything to others, "Alondra Kenon said after the Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city. "
Here in New York, all of us are talking about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee nest offices above their head, bankers and cover fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "day of work at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The winners continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their chariots and muffins trays for the mural meetings.
Latino always hang between residential buildings bearing, like mules, about 50 luxurious shirts hanged at a yoke on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to take the tail to buy their sandwich maid to outgoing merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4: 00 p.m. and 7: 00 p.m. in the week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I was discovering at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people in line.
Not in front of the caissiers' guichets, or in order to remove or make a payment, but in front of the customer service's guichet, where the usual customers ordered their boilers, the tourists asked for management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," all were in line for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from the so-called thrifts savings accounts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that only work in one state, which say treat customers like their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank, used the bankruptcy trustee, and while the New Yorkais were coming home for the weekend this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential outflow, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue in Wall Street.
Any New Yorkais have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady from my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her skinny general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in an event to present the organisation of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs illustrating red-striped mosques.
The police accuse the extreme right-wing extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the extreme right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
The offenders have painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the sense of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be some kind of election-related.
A spokesperson for the Islamic local community said that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which is just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is about to end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that rounded almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to criticism, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of the scarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to Alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
The courts have banned rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to visit Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
The police in Kent had given this ban on travel last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson declared "Thursday, September 25 in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
It must inform the authorities if it wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or potential Glitter movements in the contour.
A Kent Police spokesperson said, "Kent's police will do everything they need to protect our children like those from abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks in a much more effective way.
"to protect the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years old, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he should have embarked for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel good, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and in the end he left to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him to enter their territory and were therefore forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on August 22, and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge court, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for detention of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been prohibited from moving in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no ebony clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free from all tensions to get the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where you discover intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatrality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer reproduces the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flamande Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you should not make pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a unique character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars. "
With the "Song Popular of Mines" festival, Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, remeate classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captives the public with his art.
The search for essential and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsportsportsportsportsportARTproject" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people," the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or who just leave you a few minutes to be able to make them a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas real. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, which is called "Flamenco - people," is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule), which will be opened until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to move forward with the new project on which he works, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived 20 years in the Congo and who has passed through Amazonia.
The winner at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a true audace" and that "everything shows that he should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I would not, but I will, and I hope to finish," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "La ville et les chiens" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by most of the participants' voices, made a comble room at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in the face of a fascinated audience who did not see the time in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great amount of humour, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to make face to his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his romance.
The Hispano-American novelist has recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar," because writers have been asked "not to let themselves go to frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
The bad weather ruins Pozoblanco's fair
The party of banners that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended last morning, after the horse riders checked that the arena was impraticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has gone hard on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not have taken place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
At the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced himself in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was carried in triumph, after having made arms movements against the bull with taste and aesthetic.
In the afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discoveries applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Worse again for El Juli, who has entered the arenas of Los Llanos without any time or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in Alava province: two thousand kilos of hashisch found
Five hours less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Commune of Armiñón (Alava).
The police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two run away.
His loading, more than two tons of hachisch, that's how to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the Armiñón Commune border.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their prosecution until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the lower side, where both occupants descended to flee into a woodland area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hashisch ballots. Then, they transferred it to a police station for a comprehensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with that written on the gray card of the van, that is why they also charged the detainee with an offence of forgery of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to run away and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old prisoner, A. A. J., has been detained to carry out the various approaches and will be tried within the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a medicine
actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange manoeuvres trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesperson from the California police patrol unveiled to the People magazine.
The witness stated that around 4: 30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the accelerator in full, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she routed on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents led her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was discarded from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of driving under a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself with nerve depression.
Llamazares requested the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of former counsellor for Youth and Sports in the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out treatment of favour to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares with regard to the conduct of the political party that it will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left requested that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all public servants."
"Sangre de Mayo," Garci's oath bet
Building on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Battle of Spaniards against French in "Sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film for more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo," will be released in the movies next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirator of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he has realized with this film "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to run a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 madrilene, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spanish leader who has misled in the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he has not obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not run some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, the stage of the actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not make casting, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to theatre and cinema to keep himself informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo," "" Seven French billiard tables, "and finally the winner," Les tournesols aveugles, "are not representative of the young Spanish cinema," which would deserve to be better known, "he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you work for postérité, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you just make an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the Tórtola Valencia Sevillane dancer
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a also Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in eastern dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented women's free movement.
The life of this woman who has marked the history of the dance in Europe of the between-two-wars, has fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to interpret the Tórtola Valencia Tartilla dancer and it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think about flamenco.
So, "butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me my way of dancing was identical to her, "she says.
The staging took place thanks to two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honours me. "
The staging also took place thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Me de Morón, the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas."
This work also tells, in some way, the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to reremember her because I think these women have a huge influence in their times and now no one knows and does not highlight her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in Saint Steph's church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature concession and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reedition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having travelled to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet," edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most known andalous poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it. "
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice," and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and all over America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
It had not been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard shot for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, American esteem has fallen well down, looking desperately for grounds of dignity.
When times are so hard and for no reason to live, there remains only admiration for human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of the lost and vaincues causes, such as the foundation for the drug fight created in honour of his elder who died following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that had time to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us on the top of the bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to bend the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the objectives.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there's the one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if he did not miss opportunities to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifteck in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In the sky, he is proud to attend the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of the dedicated husband, of the loving father, of the attentive and philanthropic grandfather," he said.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever been involved in.
If they had taken all the errors that occurred during the race into account, they would be subject to an elimination note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with the withdrawal of the dossards, which makes you go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better for them to give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dossard (first error, move only for that) and (after a long waiting line) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second error, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small swimsuits with less fabric and the cheaper blow?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barack took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me who, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not be my idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O..
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a species of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company's campus) in response to what was asked for in a conversation.
With a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remember what positions they occupy - and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and she says she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we spoke in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has always added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first approach to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for understanding computer equipment and software.
He has the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operational system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, but more and more attention to the Internet browser.
We only light the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time sailing over the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serve half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can most can least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less complex month.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I am showing you an example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but in late 2009 or in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wrapped him on the Azur Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's' Blood Diamond ', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's' The Sponsor 'and is part of the muscular gays association.
And if we start to list all his appearances, we could also quote this moustachu costaud that raised weights in a moving circus.
It is not just a simple male body jersey made of cotton, moulding and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels is one of the other.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although known as' Marcel '- which has to do with sport since he takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, its unisexe cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most known body maillots have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tanks tops.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His huge resemblance with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present to the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but as well as to the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time exciting, is waiting for us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinemas of the 1950s and 1960s enchantment us and we are inspiring ourselves a lot for our collections.
I like to walk in town and watch women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think it is, but in the end, it all joins and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl, I'd like to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you endosse the clothes it is at that time that you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
So, it's all related.
You didn't have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and savor life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're being a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies. You're waiting for the different films you made last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who is a woman from the theatre, am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the production of the films' La última hora 'and' En busca from Cristo's tumba '.
To see what you'll think about it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up to the gateway to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for a lot of time, to invite me to participate in London in a charitable parade for her association in support of women and the clothes that we exhibit - I have exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for the Naomi NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person in a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, so many things are not true.
Besides, this so good side of Naomi makes me feel better.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
The repeats of the alcohol on the wheel will have to install the system 'alcolock'
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholaemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a drunken state, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project for a year.
Its purpose is to rehabilitate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, as well as the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state, take over the car.
The alcolock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the alcohol rate of the driver is higher than that allowed.
The cost is greater than EUR 1 000 and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device were reducing up to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is based only on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but reform by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The scheme is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental purposes.
The Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sleeping, but his rays still forced to put his hand as a viewer to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, all right, so we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you from here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are many to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed with marine blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very sorely and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a thunderstorm was threatening.
They make a brief stop to the photographers before they go to the room where the official cortège is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigorous Mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is probably no place more appropriate in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good-living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's window at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and she was almost in emotion.
It is certainly the second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the competition jury, have made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With as a table close to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
As she was big on her heart and made against bad fortune good heart, because of her brother's recent death, Nati set up a Mango garment and some ELAH bearings, which cut her breath, and arms over, arm underneath with her son Luis - a beautiful man almost two metres high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honour.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Rotchil Baron ended the night without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with a pants and a shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner metamorphosed with a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of ballets rehearsal and remember the good old times, she grabbed one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us before on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The following morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez - another beautiful man moving by motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there are no odours in his room.
Stars under the stunning sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The morning awakening attracts us almost when it rings every morning at 7: 00, but it's even worse when we think about the agitated rhythm that today's life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the twentieth century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a whole book a 'menu' of methods adapted to each one's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will come to the booksellers directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquillity in lieus such as work or through personal relations, this' manual 'denies such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from his mind and focus on reading.
Speak in sleep
A few children speak during the night.
I do not relate to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time that happens it can surprise you, but in fact it doesn't matter.
It's a benign alteration of sleep called somniloganda.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon may appear in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or in a more periodic way (daily, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep changes such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pee in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overrexcitation situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that has not been studied.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a little quiet voice, with isolated words, murmures or on the contrary with screams, crying, long speeches...
In case somniloganda becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign alteration, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another deterioration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to a apnea of sleep or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore looking for quiet games and avoiding programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and resting.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don't have the temptation to question him for information.
You will not get anything, because by sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to the way you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last.
Illhaeusern finally regained the path of victory on his field after a long period of disappointment.
Without making a big game, the Yellow and Black have created the greatest number of opportunities and have managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visitor captain Kauffmann who rocked the lucarn on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and turn back Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn above, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to chatouiller Dannemarie's defence.
In front of it, we were in the middle of the ground and we were just leaving the Riahi stirring at the point of the attack.
The start of the second half-time was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a bullet pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd ').
But the Illhousians butor will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the vestiaires a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Ilhousian Eleven who just retracted a little to "compacter" his defence, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big cowling, the ball was passing very close to the cross.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before we fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a detour by Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of force of fishermen who have seriously disrupted access to several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the fishermen of the country to obtain measures against the flourishing of the prices of diesel oil, which has reached a record of over 1.14 euro per litre on average.
According to Elysée's spokesperson David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses rebuild competitiveness and to secure conditions of employment and compensation for sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected from a firm foot by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they carried out escargots in Morbihan and Calvados, causing close to 10 km of closures.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-île not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon Presque.
The sailors have already shown their determination Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic facade and the Manche, like the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendea, where the trawlers remained at dock, or in Havre, where about 20 ships blocked the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Donges Total refinery.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting of Wednesday at the department to decide possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must in fact decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris," for example, said Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 centimes per litre, but they believe that the cost-effectiveness threshold for a vessel is only reached with a diesel oil less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut house.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the cinema and the engaged actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner tables out of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are planting on the world economy.
The fourth global aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 delivered aircraft, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first semester, the airplane delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes very much about the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have fled, is planning to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been put forward to it, according to the Dominical edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retirement activity in the United States, says the newspaper that quotes sources close to the file.
The AIG Board of Directors met Sunday in the evening to discuss possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its subsidiary of International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing, its 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, added the FT.
No final decision has been made on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make cash available to repay the $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris History of the Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives' rejection of the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in his history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, with a technological dominant, gave 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points), to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street fell down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan which was to allow for a little stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this," she added, feared that a project adopted in several days would arrive "too late."
"If the project is actually moribond (...) then the relay will be moved quickly to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza said.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of Wachovia's banking activities by his rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has abruptly accelerated, pushing for emergency interventions to banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets face "not only an American crisis but a global crisis," added FTN Financial's analyst.
The bond market has been strong.
The return on the 10-year Treasury bill fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the return on 30-year-olds to 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television duel
At the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates succeeded another to know who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, took it away.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% against 44% to McCain), considers that it was the Democrat who drew his pin from the game.
In the indecis, who are the ones who count, Obama came out to win 39% of the probes, while 25% of them gave victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his roommate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts, "said Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagenary McCain has been constantly highlighting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naiveté" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be President," he also assured.
An angle of attack marteled since yesterday in Republican television ads.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without dismantling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the republican for not having taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under a beating rain.
He did not even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial deroute clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of the Americans despite Wall Street's soubresauts, the senator of Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudents, both candidates sketched the questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young and opponents protested on Sunday night in the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislatures in advance.
A few hundred of Belarus met on Sunday night as soon as polling stations were closed in Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukashenko's power: "the dictator, resignation."
Some confess not even voting: "What good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been successful for foreign observers with the aim of resuming their language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be own by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous consolidation of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the 2006 presidential opposition and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the voices, and in us it is the executive power.
If opposition members enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean space on television, regional meetings and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "we must start dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted vis-à-vis Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent. "
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that participation figures appear too high, and that the generalization of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there is an election, you? question the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition members in Parliament, those who are best in power. "
The silence of the night goes back to the square of October.
On television, President Loukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood has become safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec has become one of the world's most secure and effective blood providers.
Most importantly, he reconquered the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada established a public investigation, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.
While Justice Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has completed this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," said Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood and field work products during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence, "she said before proudly asserting that in early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile."
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one that has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when we do not know it and a serious disease may result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom more than a month since 1980 was therefore refused.
A few years ago, however, it was unquestionably shown that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied has meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique was found in the market: Nucleic Acid (NAT) tests that directly detect the presence of the virus itself and not of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used to date were based.
The NTAs have shortened the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product survives.
I think we can feel comfortable today to receive or prescribe blood transfusion to recover health, "says Héma-Québec's Chief Executive Officer.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
No later than last year has appeared on the island of the Meeting the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant, "says Dr. Decary before we point out that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for adequate supply.
"Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
As anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet recharge.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
A healthy person who is 18 years of age and older who meets the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and cannot give their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and to encourage them to become a regular donor.
As today's life is so frightened, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving from his blood, "Francine Decary discloses.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye globes and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cordon blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, has a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank of our millionth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand of it a year.
We should start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Decary, who describes this cordon blood collection program as very popular.
"Several mamans are disappointed to be unable to access it," as Héma-Québec has no means of offering this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in half-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the half-final round of the USL's first division playoff series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) win at the Seattle Sounders' expense yesterday in the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series in total goals, at the Saputo Stade.
The middle of the field Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without purpose on both sides, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other fillets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
It is recalled that during the first round-back game on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the half-final.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still had access to the 5-4 half-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In Brief - Kovalev's Victory Purpose
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the Canadian attack in a 3-2 win at the Florida Panthers dam last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec raised two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable. "
"He tried to do too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation. "
Charest put on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out opening elections before the end of the year
At the end of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon, Quebec City yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected during today's by-election.
"Repousser les limites de notre dernière grande frontière du Nord": c' est la ambition de long terme que Jean Charest a présenté avec force visuelle tout en restant dans les grandes lignes, à la fin du conseil général du Parti libéral du Québec, à Lévis, hier.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected some sort of Moulin with images.
In loop, on three huge screens, spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Great means as in the election period.
In the press, by the way, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
However, the Prime Minister simply explained why the North was "a jewel with huge potential," but did not give any maturity, investment amounts or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France," "it's in our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in our home, but it is in us, "he insisted, as to show well that he called for a national founder myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after having made a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity comes, I repeat this position on behalf of the government, "he said.
On the other hand, "with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with about 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision."
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded him.
"Like the liberals that preceded us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, in Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
As a press point, he used another reference, conservative of this one, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest noted that its implementation was scheduled for 2012.
"This remains between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his activists, provoking home-to-home applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably no election in 2009, did not disregard the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, as the law allows him.
He pointed out that his schedule was, however, met, in particular by a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the end of the week provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The pequist leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is back from vacation today.
Letters - A Depreciated Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O'ironie) in Harper Cabinet, who allowed last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
Jeter the opprobre over this woman who has led an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as long about the Prime Minister's surroundings as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved not to have repatriated his national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent at the time of the facts against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier under inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a court parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be remembered that UNICEF, International Amnistie and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy," this word that Harper continues to sneak and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when no morals exist: one can mislead, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government so far minority (what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what is the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, he states that the world's largest gold company has instituted a six million defamation prosecution against three authors and a small publishing house without the sou in order to launch a "transparent public debate."
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dare to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable money in order to prepare for their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost shallow pockets of the mining.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, are often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will build the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who oses to reconsider this issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are normally done through the exchange of ideas rather than through mackerel.
It was therefore enough for the mining industry to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and dismisses petitions and letters of support to Black Canada's authors from hand to hand.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while disregard the opinions of that same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to publicly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so first of all because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, not in the context of what many people perceive as a follow-up (continuing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has also just filed a call for the authors of Black Canada to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's overreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, which is essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that dislike the rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, subject to repetition, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
It provides for, inter alia, better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for lack of payment, as well as a right of regard on the wages paid to the leaders of the rescued companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House of Representatives President Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis at Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbance on the day-to-day lives of the Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in recent hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline for agreement was the opening of markets this morning.
In late association with the negotiations, the two candidates for the American presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but not in dissatisfaction with the fact that we are forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed itself to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, in particular to allow owners to keep their homes and to the salary of government-rescued business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no welcome.
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the waves of American television.
Interrogated on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something that we are all going to have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable, "he said.
The $700 billion plan is intended to redeem with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risk-effective and invendable claims of US financial institutions.
After 14 months of crisis triggered by the collapse of a real estate bubble which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits (subpremiums) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the debandade of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected representatives who had put the first draft agreement on hold last week.
It is believed that it has been out of this impasse since the Democrats have accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to rounding the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its release.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which will be added $100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion dollars should be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing in the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on pay and severance benefits paid to the leaders of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Voice continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, member of the House's Finance Committee, to his voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one to take advantage of taxpayers. "
A moderator of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Awards, wrote to us: Congress was asked not to press and carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had indicated that it had renounced its competitor in full wreck since it had lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the US risk real estate loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not money lost," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that time is uncertain. "
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank malled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of the current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than US $41 billion (US $75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander reported yesterday that it would purchase the branches and accounts to the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azur was long his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Was he free from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charmor smile?
Yes and no.
His dizziness, his sensitivity and a talent that came from the source will also have moved him away from the power register that violates the true sacred monsters.
But what a big cross-country rider!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at 83 years of age from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons in American cinema of the years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and whose long was a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and burst of the dramatic conventions.
The mixed boars often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without demeasured ego, ultimate quality mark.
For in him was a whole country of self-made man, of the fighter of the Pacific war, injured in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who militated for civil rights was also the car pilot who ranked second at the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, combined with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Disappear with him also the shade areas of this secret, discreet, engaged star, allergic to the flashes of the show-business, which we will not have completely perished in the riddle.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance gave the vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend, as his great roles are embodied on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation spans through him.
Back in memory of Butch Cassidy's charm cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable Tennessee Williams burning roof in 1958.
More close to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at his old age by a marriage that did not meet all his promises.
So many more Paul Newman has gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and vengeance in Robert Rossen's beautiful The Hustler (1961), he took over the character on his return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, who in 1987 had his only Oscar on nine appointments.
This face through ages was him.
He's still here.
The epochs bypass through his course.
The young people are most familiar with him through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen Brothers.
With a last role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several legends of the cinema that had given up the job early enough, Newman would have been in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its outdoors, its own and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "a living challenge to" underplaying "judging his services too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles long fell all cooked in the beak.
However, he played the first young people less often than the marginals: neurosis, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the raids and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, traced an end female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose denounced his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of dizziness and sadness.
Among the rains of hommages that hailed on Newman yesterday, his great boyfriend and former weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestatary of Hollywood's riders is also collapsed.
We have seen a lot of his binette trapping on dressing pots, sauces, biscuits and other food, judging the process of rather bad taste, although gag at the beginning.
The profits of these sales were nevertheless paid to its Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
A model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company make in their invoices factory?
Prochainement, le 8 octobre, va commencer les audiences relatives à la procédure pénale en cours, contre János Zuschlag et ses complices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having led to particularly significant damage. Other charges have been held against them, for example, fake and use of fake.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the State and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of costs, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained bills from the Józsefváros market, while they made the pills in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, made by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he had to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the basis of which they realised the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Ouzri, who according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
In a "tracking circuit," one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided for the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager's remarks, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later be named Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, was a group of misleading forms and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The emitters of overriding imagination invoices also fell in excess, when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to information given to the public prosecutor's office.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, said at hvg.hu site that when the prosecutor's office called him and showed him the invoices, he knew, right away, that it was fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had accommodated there, did not collate either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much room.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time. "
Zeled invoices issuers also did not find out about Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only organized travel abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the agency's accounting practices.
Surprisingly, as it appeared in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services concerning travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp to Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the fake were written by hand.
The prosecution's investigation revealed that "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, which the invoices issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment board.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false pills, that invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sporting course, both of which deny to be the authors of invoices issued on their behalf.
The trumpets also did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the company's liquidator denies having issued this invoice.
Intentionally established factories
Another category of invoices emitters is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has made an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület Association, for an amount of about five million HUF, but behind which no benefit was actually provided.
There was no financial movement, either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but that was why organizations did not mention it in their accounts.
The following category of invoices-issuing companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate to the Director General of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment for an amount of about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he took their countervalue.
It is precisely at Iván Kubatov's request that Romanian masons have created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave 15 invoices in total to organizations, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The public prosecutor's office thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért Association applied for a grant to the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant twice as much as 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to TMA.
In addition, these invoices were found during the search in the Árpád Kemecsei office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making invoices, as it had already done before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to raise the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of much of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would bear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since requests for his detention in a supervised residence, based on a reduction in his conditions of detention, are constantly falling into the ear of a deaf.
While those who have caused much more damage, and those responsible for non-reparable economic offences, are travelling freely or at least, are waiting at their own home for the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of overauction: why are we spending more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that's why they prefer even to pay too high a price.
This research has tried to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auction sales.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group took part in a ludic auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (MMR), researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, one essential element of which is the overauction of a third party, the whole being under the brain trunk, called striatum, was intensively moving during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overcrowded by a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus carried out their placement.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were going out to win the game, then they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
While the third group received those $15 before the auction, the group members also lost that money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on victory in one group, while in the other on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the "against failure" team were prepared to put higher than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation. "- noted Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the first causes of death.
It is estimated that the Hepatitis Virus patients in Hungary are one hundred miles away, but only seven miles are being treated. This is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to liver-affected infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Liver inflammation and yellowness are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are spread mainly in two forms: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or contaminated water), Hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic liquids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is in any case recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C. vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the use of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible yellowish, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing may take two to three weeks.
Every year, around the world, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells sadly. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
As a result, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a laboratory routine examination, it is advisable to consult his treating doctor upon the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be healed, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development, and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford realized an interesting experience by analyzing how much faith in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least odd, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
With a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also possible to discover that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look in a sustained way at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during that time, received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding, while watching either the religious-theme painting or the more general-theme painting.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt themselves "safe," like someone we "take care of" and "calmed, and peace invaded them."
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, thinks that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided we find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, indeed change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain of subjects if one showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you disclose about you.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google states that we can find him at the bottom of people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centres of interest are.
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they just don't see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, recently, at the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to meet their initial goal that sounded as follows: "Collect all the information of the world in a system!."
According to Google's leader interrogated, after ten years of a global camboulement work, they are still only at the beginning of their objectives of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, on the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can consult what they have been looking for, what they have clicked about. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more customized answers, and will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? ask users, who are concerned about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the remord, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophilia, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing for an identification.
Human rights-related Internet users were able to push a suspicion of relief last May, when Google, arm below with the EFF electronic legal protection agency, proved its right to court in front of the FBI. According to the judgement given, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about the secret request of the FBI, of any nature.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research that it had won in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it is not able to obtain the lists of private users' research, or the full list of websites and keywords for the past two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is flawed by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "savages" bringing together passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of large companies, the "connected company," as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as invader of the world because of Windows, even though both fight for the same goal.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its identification code users, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword in recent years, is just behind it.
The web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other features, such as Twinter, or last.fm, reading his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
While we can get to know many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the morning pictures, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that dismissed one of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of privacy is completely to be reconsidered today.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle behind today's youth behaviour.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, not intentionally leaving any trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not least. Google's services online, by way of text processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed so far.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will unveil its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords / AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasingly high rate cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other IT program creators.
However, the critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the company kindergarten and after the company has considered the daily multiple restoration to be too expensive, taken at any time. All this seems to be disgusting next to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is about is that in the coming months and years, they are going to make the world move on new points. While some think that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking so important dimensions that the company will soon be facing the United States Supreme Court, others are trembling in front of its health system, because in it, we can build a full medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets up a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with orwellian half tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a scary way only through Google data.
Two miners helped to remove the traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police summoned two miners to question them in the case of Ózd's double homicide. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - declared the spokesperson of the police station department of Borsod.
The young people have recognized the facts against them, and for the time being they are accused of complicity.
The two miners, who, according to MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) reports, are young girls, are defending themselves free.
The complicity of murder may lead to detention for up to five years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a young man in the 23-year-old corner, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, and that is why he drew his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as his 9-year-old little daughter.
According to MTI's reports, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of that.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Scholarship makes a proposal for the repurchase of the Prague Scholarship
The Warsaw stock exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroons, for the repurchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the fact that, previously, the Czech have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to separate itself from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Scholarship, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Scholarship would be the least good new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Scholarship in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at between 5 and 10 billion Czech Kroons by market experts.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of holdings, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which are worsening from day to day, European press leaders are already referring to a "second 11 September."
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the US President" - accuses the daily Rome, La Repubblica. "The President was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to go-fast, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as mentioned by billionaire Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
Part of the madrilene press also sees scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing every day, and then the world will pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real danger is that that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy spends in the vacuum, just when in the history of capitalism one of the greatest transformations is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - points out the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states can still bring a life buoy to their titubant financial organizations, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks fall like dominos, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to make little of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial agencies received more than €100 billion - recalled the Vietnamese daily, Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the US in order to address the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is going through, on the other hand, the old continent.
The "saviors" must not immediately hook up a hundred billion euros, on the other hand it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What would be the best way to develop technologies that could avoid an obstacle, except for the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the astonishing project presented at the CEATEC, held in Japan, the bees were given the strategic starting idea to Nissan's engineers to inspire them on how they must design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robotic control system, of the BR23C type, which it has equipped with bees qualities, the final objective being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks very much like our secure protection hull - explained at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and public technological relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays an essential role, as it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers addressed the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into a avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the bee's movements, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning in an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Contrary to any existing system at present, this avoidance manoeuvre is carried out entirely instinctively.
"If this were not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," said Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protection envelope, a layer where the collision is considered inevitable at the moment.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a glance.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonal, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary movement, acceleration as well as slowing as manoeuvres available to the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses polymer Lithium batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentration, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-bytes of continuous memory.
We don't need a memory of giga-bytes or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of an instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter serial-made cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan to redeem the banks' doubtful credits, and to use in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters announced that in new debates that continued until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. Pelosi said there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the economic rouages into the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday night at 8: 00 p.m. local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2: 00 a.m., according to the local time in Central Europe), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the advances that have been achieved this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
On the other hand, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal that the $700 billion must be spent in one time for the repurchase of securities for doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion amount can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the law is passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious claims, mortgage securities and suspicious mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent individuals stated that redemption may take place in an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concern, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large repurchase of suspicious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other large financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad position and waiting for state aid can expect their severance benefits, simply called a golden outAtlantic parachute, to be capped by the government.
Wage cap is mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat provides support to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat redeems as part of an auction, they will collect a surplus tax on the golden parachute unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must still be added that existing gold parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force regarding the appointments of the Directors General - commented the President of the Committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall back on their legs.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said Republican MP of California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same that calls for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to the previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared with the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry have only undergone a small increase in the order of 0.1 per cent from July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of footwear with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher prices of plastics and chemicals resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the product and chemical manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
The result was deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), and a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry increased between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in national industrial exploitation, prices were up 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing prices experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacturing of metallurgical products, there was an increase in prices by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have taken place in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have evolved between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the internal trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, it was the profit-to-investment initiating sectors that showed the most significant monthly price rise (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for further processing did not change over the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-generating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that around January 12, the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the time that the overseas electronic entry and control systems will be put into service."
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Cross of Commander with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, the Barack Obama Democrat and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the President of the two major American parties, provided support for the government's $700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who require the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the aim of disclosing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even, each as more apt than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the focus on economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a roommate just after the republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the $700 billion rescue plan law.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but not doing anything is not a possible way."
The Republican senator stated that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Board of Control and the ceilings of senior management severance benefits, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not have a substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as soon as Monday.
The press review of German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - that is, Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left information magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers."
According to this recognized politiciologist, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad Duo Beckstein-Huber took up his duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This time change is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday, came to an end a process that was likely to be of this, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was catching up with 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause of this can be attributed to the "devouring parents," which the CSU has set up in the region in a consistent way.
The sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the developing Bavaria region could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that the voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the traditional groups of citizens who have rather moved away from the CSU, such as self-employed, craftsmen, bac holders and graduate graduates.
In these groups, support for the USC has fallen below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? Party President stands on the reserve in the face of the questions of the coalition," the Austrian Conservative daily takes care of the situation of the confuse internal policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything is going around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders have barely let their cards see.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of both parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer has reacted with caution to the proposals of the red.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere with ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily an open issue, which must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, whose host is France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Member of Parliament for the European People's Party Fidesz, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of Member of Parliament Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka has warned that alongside the distinctions found during the hiring, the Roma disappear from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor basic education, only a small party has the opportunity to obtain a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as the basic right of the human being plays a key role in upholding other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of EU member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely it is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from its income and consumption, it participates in the State budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - Lívia Járóka stressed.
According to the Member, objective-oriented collaboration and action by the European Union is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of school dissegregation, which is of paramount importance in respect of existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployed people. We must give the opportunities guaranteed by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe held each year since the Summit in Berlin last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and member country levels.
CSU: grace for a transition period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the torn duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the Congress of the Exceptional Party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized pair, in any case, felt that they did not care specifically about their seats.
As a result, they worked to soothe the furious members of the fraction and base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria, accounting for 18 per cent of German GDP.
But conservatives still have a strong count in this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor to Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, trained along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange foot of destiny was that using the list of Free Electors, enters into the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, whose taking of action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then to treat unmanageably the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who had so far taken the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some acerb remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be a chancellor again if they rebuild in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, when it is difficult to hide his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively affect the great coalition in Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of socio-democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0
No member of the opposition acceded to the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, who provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegality in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very opposed for long decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition unite its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term of president for the fourth time in suspicious elections, on the traces of the amendment of the constitution in 2006, "would allow" this time the presence of a few opposition deputies in Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ has renounced its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where, because of the Belarusian anti-democratic political order, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the ever-more expensive decline in imports of Russian natural gas, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas ducts crossing the country, has passed into the Russian hands.
The fact that the OSCE, in its evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on failures, such as the prohibition of a third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior ease.
However, the OSCE press release on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a paper confederation, considers the two independent territories for already a month.
"We have made two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevitch to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, although "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even one opponent."
The opposition does not provide for protests in the light of the results, rather it is trying to send its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us in the wheels with regard to dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the older people's circle," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most formally supported layer of pensioners no longer considers the most appropriate.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security," recalling the silence of a cemetery ', is only a matter of time "- Milinkevitch says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had no rotating doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But from today on, this new measure is in force against the little malins, against whom points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-fainting novelty was presented today by Public Administration Minister Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating gates - says Brunetta- are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the Minister.
Now start a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta also points out.
The installation in all institutions of the Council Presidency is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotary doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
"This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Promesse of Brunetta, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7: 00 am is an excellent and greedy resolution."
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the Minister reported that "in three months, the absences of public employees from illness have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year."
And he added that it was essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the Ministry - these last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"while the Minister of Public Service today expands data about the decline in absenteeism in the workplace because of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of" active fainters "continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances for invalidity due to service; the extension of the hours of permanent home hours of the sick worker, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Workplace Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that demonstrate the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and information resources on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil today celebrates, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workers' Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Munitions and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the ongoing collective effort to promote prevention in the workplace, protection of accidental workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness"
"Naturally indignated, everyone has struck fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, raise the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to keep attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data from the accidents on work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths still being impressive, "later pointed out the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not want this" downward trend "to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that the tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"According to us, Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
He added that "there is still a need to make an effort with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there is a need for greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced" the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work "and" the drift of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years. "
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker the insurance guarantee - has he added - so that the fate of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 finger-pointed player, they risk the hearing.
Listen to full-volume music for an extended period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers, can cause permanent hearing lesions.
This is what the European Commission, which in a press release published in Brussels, is announcing the opinion of the Scientific Committee on unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable music devices, for more than one hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data - continues responsible U- this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in view of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies. "
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate.
"The scientists-concluded the executive U- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties what measures could be adopted to better protect children and adolescents against noise exposure from portable and similar musical devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is increased concern about hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Ue Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decimals) for 5 hours per week, exceed current limits on the maximum level of noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the time frame set by the Capitole for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale," which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will finalize the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Community Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitole and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to underline Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome for use by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her tasks and then disappeared, as this experience must have a precise time period.
In June-announces the mayre- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by day-to-day management and emergencies that are manifested from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see progress, and further forward, towards a deeper future, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future. "
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citadins, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, to allow our city, to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit,."
A future that, according to the Mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the other hand, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the Islam enemy. "
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections is closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really culotted: he believes that he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators! "
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still a person who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississipi, in the outskirts of the South of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting box, we know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
This is how an aspect of American mentality is emerging, kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Choses never revealed so far, so much that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
A total of 1500 people were asked: what were the errors made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent home by foot to the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to suitcase.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's point of weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stain to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debate is felt even among journalists: in the press it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "assassination" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future today.
However, they have not openly declared to the information officers, feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
It is a problem that, according to the journalists interviewed, needs to be solved if traditional journalism as the general public hears it, is to be reduced accordingly.
A clear but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
Journalists don't have to see where the web goes.
The largest publishers have a passage to the Internet, seen by many as "the killer" of the paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the greatest rush in American journalism lies between those who lead newsrooms- that is, the directorates - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "occupational safety."
Directors who think they are losing their job within 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
The directors almost always receive large wages, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payment.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banqueroute as part of the instruction on the Unipol-Bnl climbing.
During his trial last week, he had been released from home as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the province city to a house in the capital.
According to the court, such displacements (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is yesterday's New York Times that confirms it to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, precisely, that was felt in a despotic way with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake preannounces or already lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be just here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the reupdate, the extraordinary revival, of the double state-sovereign category, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with abroad, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs: that is to say to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalization seems really out of play or, well, does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that all are waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credit: when we are going through a difficult period, there are only those states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the means and legitimization to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new stage of the state-nation crisis is at the same time in perfect harmony with the ever-major importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor rather linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, when we were convinced that we had now entered the kingdom of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have realised with one blow, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with things rather little material like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be carried from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, oil and water.
I now arrive at the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
That says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shade zone.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of West countries.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now to their apogee, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, in an underground way, provides a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimassions of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in improvised "revolts" elections or, in the recent collective mood changes of the latter, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressists against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy has not come by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, as someone would say, are always more difficult, which is not today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially agitating in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say, keep your eyes open, it's not for no reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Fight the laws of gravity with a great glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body on a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nano tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
The scientists inspired themselves from the geckos' legs, covered with microscopic hairs that provide the animal with a perfect adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "easily detains from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MURS MARKET? - "This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
May be to walk on walls like Spiderman? May be that yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since the carbon nano tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications may concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
AUTRE RECHERCHE - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented an adhesive made up of microfibres such as hair, which automatically cleans dust during movement over an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because desalterants and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juice, whether in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICAMENTS - It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, who had given the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mix and to pay attention to what is drinking, if you take medicines like, for example, Diazépam or Methadone.
NOT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call by Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are in general reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs as needed.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the drugs that are taken, and if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist, "said the expert at Ansa agency.
The Nobel of Economy to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Economic Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editorialist at the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest criticisms of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that rocked many controversy, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which now has proved to be exact.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist," but also a "very aggressive, particularly critical to the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the broadcast of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to touch always and even more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a presque one year work by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with a variety of new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised interface and become less austere, to other more important, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to some modules, such as that that that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, retaining the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with elements of a worksheet or text developer.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the worksheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflict on changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version is unloadable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the cd of installation may be dispatched to the home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free work can be a way to disseminate it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office next tries the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
In addition to the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could be open to business prospectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the worksheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's maillot.
It is the website of the daily L'Équipe who reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl's assays are part of those carried out in recent weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity of the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place at the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity in the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus flaming the best climber's peas suit.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES IS REQUEST IF ITALY IS RACISTE?
Italy "as a country of emigration has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This would turn the Beau pays into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which has dedicated a long article about the theme of racism in Italy, based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was killed last month in Milan, for stole a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those with "more integration and more work," but also "a strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the North Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislature required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestine people, is cited as proof of climate change in Italy.
Tendance underscored by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market does not experience a crisis
According to the last Sunia survey, the tenants' union, rent a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 euros in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 euros in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand on the part of students has distorted the market so much that a process of widespread increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, the rental offers also contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered contracts, without rent limits, subleases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are necessary to calmer prices.
Listing in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we range from a minimum of 650 euros (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350 / 400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250 / 280 euros for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for one single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We can save only if we move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300 / 400 euros, for a simple one, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed you have to count 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a later anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25 / 30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Adieu old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic rooms.
Historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes"
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore, is a good example of what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multihalls, and the death of consumption of mono halls in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that we find ineluctable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historic places and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a part of the way and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix de la jurée de Cannes, and that tells the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, lost may be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Romaine Emilie is in the lead with 82 mono-halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multiroom cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it is still necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these people are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the misdemeanor of the credit for traders: the State's previous debt is about €10 million.
It is shameful that, from a moral and ethical point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million per year.
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which is concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono theatres in the historical centres and on the outskirts.
Among the planned standards, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the area with limited circulation, and will have special rates for parking and certain parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
It is clear, however, that in order to contrast the super power of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" to which I have already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn on the other side to not see the blackened panels by the dust.
Links between politics and "ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town Hall with the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy charges are launched by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, to the mayor and vice-mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The manets also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son lawyer, homonym of the boss, already convicted for association of malfaiteurs of the mafieuse type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral standards, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local governments had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus, the clan - write the judges - would have been granted to officially enter the mayors facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafious intensity is higher than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of ndrangheta, heroes who are honest "
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to presumed conditions between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a right-wing central coalition after the May 2006 ballottage.
He cried to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accused of manigancing it all for a political question, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the change of the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerged "the availability to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, unifying the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from waves, now the big ones are throwing.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the world's area, and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have set their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the ecological authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity requirement could be covered by seawater operating systems.
This amount would be double that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colosses at the attack.
The first company to be built on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a real revolutionary step.
At two years of age, more and more candidates among these companies who have always been dedicated to traditional energy rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies - has declared the spokesperson for a company associated with the American oil colosse, at the economic daily Wall Street Journal- and assesses the possibilities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question is concerned with obtaining a deliberate permit by the US Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that just in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which are on the way to energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicate an increasing interest.
Tecnology to be developed.
The experts are talking about a technology still in its early stages, on the other hand the fact that marine energy does not dissipate concerns about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major ecosystem problem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which makes sludge move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure is turning a turbine that in turn generates a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
At present, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of water during tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotatory movement that generates a generator.
Verdant has announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, at this moment deserves the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others, are looking to the coastline, invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and plans to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
