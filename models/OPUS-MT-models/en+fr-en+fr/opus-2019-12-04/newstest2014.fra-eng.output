Spectacular saut en "wingsuit" au-dessus de Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter on Thursday over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it rose to 160 km / h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3,000 metres in altitude, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While the US road network planners have difficulty finding the money needed to repair the autoroutier infrastructure in decepitude, many are looking at a solution in the form of a small black box that sets above the dashboard of your car.
The aircraft, which record all the miles travelled by a motorist and transmits the information to public servants, is at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to redesign the obsolete system of financing the major United States roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of the major axes suddenly led to a very lively debate and lively alliances.
Libertarians have joined ecological groups to pressure the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while Congress members are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental rider.
This is really indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which states that the state is beginning to record the miles travelled by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the pump, is financially saddle.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while the prices of gasoline are high.
"The gasoline tax is simply not tenable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had tractors installed on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks calls this a cost of using the mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the House of Representatives Transport Committee, said that he also considered him the most viable long-term alternative.
The supporters of the Reason Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay per mile.
"This is not just a tax that is plunged in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to payment by mile.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House Presidency killed the proposal, meeting the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to work or to town.
However, several States and large cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state a mileage fee instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the East American coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their least facts and gestures.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management in Nevada's Department of Transport.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU was warning its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged localization devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily arrivals and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many miles travel a car, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It was seeking to perch into the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have rained to the planners of the big axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically per modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, General Manager of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all government residents.
Other states are hoping to sell the concept to misleading citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officers are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking expenses, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on mile payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the Bay of San Francisco area, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"It is not necessary to use radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four unpublished listeners
The English musician has not finished surprises this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he concocted a luxury reedition scheduled for 4 November, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th anniversary, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, date of 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to scintille the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not out of surprises, David Bowie had more than one turn in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-edit this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he had a real feast for his fans.
This reedition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both each of the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a booklet with words...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a tastefully controlled rock electricity.
Unpublished ones already in listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-face: a worrying intro before a light cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, even to Gravity?
With this enchanting title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, enlighteners, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing cameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man on board a rocket, potential Martian...
He dissipates and reveals at once, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, particularly with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Nothing surprising that he has a hand mask in the photography of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, of the brand Louis Vuitton, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attaché by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before being ready, he said.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured members - who do not meet the rule of "universality of service" of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a series of different tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay an additional year in order to be able to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was completely different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I was not ready," he said in an interview with La Presse canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine how much latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers are up to three years old to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required period of service to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal spokesman for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, asked Wednesday for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."
Disney put on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to focus on tablets at its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Calley's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior Division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the Callie pussy, sheriff of a city in the west of America where she makes order rule with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," said Albert Cheng, Vice President for Digital Products at Disney / ABC Television Group, cited in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of his series and build new relationships with his audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under-2 years had already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of the under-8 years, compared with 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US Intelligence Complainant, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he is entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the United States Ministry of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, said to Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany were put to a hard test following complaints that NSA had listened to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP leading the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green Member, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be "safe" there, said the Member.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including in the United States - have found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance is of public use.
The letter provides an offer for cooperation with the German authorities "once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Câble subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in the future that does not seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," said Cogeco's President and CEO Louis Audet in interview.
Cogeco Cable thus embodies the step to its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary has not yet a specific date with respect to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco's p.-d.g. and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the Harper Government's announcement in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to provide customers with the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages is not working," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's p.-d.g..
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported having recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 ¢per share, for the same period last year.
The Montréal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Broadband cable, based in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, a Vancouver-based Internet supplier, for $526 million.
Cogeco's revenues grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 ¢per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Câble's revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Câble customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of clients flucking in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horseback meat was detected in beef cans, sold by two small British low-price distribution signs, today announced the agency responsible for food hygiene.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at 1-5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain beef only.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4: 00, a motorist running north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but they were not feared for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6: 00, Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to have the baggage paid by hand
Frontier Airlines is considering paying up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start paying up to $100 for a hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened canette with them at the descent of the aircraft.
The new hand baggage costs are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fee in advance.
"We don't want to have this price paid," she explained.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less things on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges will not really be used to collect money.
This is about making the most faithful Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the top compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay.
For example, a tail passenger at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these costs before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's hand baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often rouse about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people at Wall Street regard the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not pay for baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand-luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the charges in supplement.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines frame, recently traveled to Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door as passengers discovered the unusual baggage charges imposed by the company.
"I had never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire professional career," he said.
I was expecting some toothgrinding and a fight to break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "The passengers are mounted on board at the speed of the flash."
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take soda or fruit juice can take the unopened canette with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge baggage charges when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
The airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, she reduced the miles' premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a border trip of 1,000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they buy their tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful clientele in her home city, Denver, but her activity is falling back and she loses money.
Revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to reconcile Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
NSA calls into question an "internal error" rather than computer pirates for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday that it was a bug that caused the failure of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that took place during a planned update," said the espionage agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a denial of distributed service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, on-line server trackers noted that the NSA site had been out for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
The NSA once ultra secret, a time called the "No Such Agency," was found under the fire of the projectors and strongly criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive communications monitoring programs at the national level and abroad - which are part of NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by NSA's former unabused consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that this evening's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to proponents who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of Labour Relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Bisson.
The Delta is closed in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza that will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling almost 600 rooms will see the day within two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens's purchase project starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge with fractured in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to the closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After abandoning the plant purchase project in January, you are coming back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers," who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that face-volt.
Is it to make Mr. Montebourg happy?
I'm not trying to make anyone happy.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicapped France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to enlarge.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a correct price and skilled workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of agreement are you waiting for between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory was closed, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Titan could therefore move the machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Mr. Montebourg therefore needs a Titan commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employee.
How can we provide long-term guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg is able to reach agreement between the CGT and Goodyear and Titan is buying the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is down, while aircraft deliveries and orders are down
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a decrease in aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious business schedule before September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to the forecast and the stock price decreased by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for increase in the stock exchange in the next quarter or in the next two quarters.
"Although the decrease in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," said Cameron Doerksen in a customer note.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will catapulter it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's assertions about the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new line aircraft.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will meet its 300-firm target before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving forward in accordance with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and provide for an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly after, "said the company.
However, analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight test - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal calendar - strengthens our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted action result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 million to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 Md, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth aeronautical manufacturer indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared to 57 one year earlier.
Net controls have fallen to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 million as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics's revenues decreased by 13% to $2 Md.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, stated that the revenues of this division had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 Md.
The Transport Division's order book totalled $32.6 Md as at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered from enforcement problems with respect to a few large contracts.
The leaders announced that new guidance would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share course, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Google Inc's Chief Financial Officer, would be on board of directors, fell from 8.5% to Canadian $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest aeronautical manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23-27 year-old speleologists had been missing in a gulf under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, were learned on Friday at the Speleo rescue of the Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one aguerri to practice and the other no, had gone underground on Thursday around 9: 30 to cross the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were not aware of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5: 00 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo Relief in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
Some 20 rescue workers, ten civilians from the French Spéléo Relief, as well as gendarmes, CRS and fire fighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambery, were found "exhausted, but not injured."
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their steps while waiting for relief, said the prefecture.
Refed, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescue workers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union invited its members on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging," she said in a press release.
It considers "scandalous" information from the Washington Post, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union that claims 38.000 members.
Repeated lights: a Member of Parliament requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels's "relifting" project from the signalling lights in Brussels does not like everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project of repeating 16 signalling posts of the region with yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the identity of Brussels."
The idea is, in the end, to repeal all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of about €1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandisation" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not happy to spend folly the money of Brussels in operations of relifting signage poles to the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of flamandisation of the Capital," said M. De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repeated herself in dark-black yellow-blue-black the Brussels poles.
According to the Member, there is now no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Brussels people deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD & V minister who is carrying out the NVA program itself.
It's high time to stop the Trojan de la Flandre horse.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brussels!," concludes M. De Bock.
the portique of Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The ecotaxy portic of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent protest of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday morning, was dismantled.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 hours, and traffic on the national was hijacked into the ditch.
The decision of dismantling, announced by the Finistère Prefecture on Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portic.
This is the last of the three ecotaxis portics in a state of operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been disassembled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessories shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a microfibre protective cover or an intra-auricular header.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father erased from the living world.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "meet him."
There is no recipe, no method of use to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat as I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the night table.
It's my smiling father's image that comes with me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, crapped on this cold bed hospital.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the skinny glow of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by little daytime or night appearances, a little timid, a little erased, she quickly came back in my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that believed herself in mourning.
And then she was revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated that person, during her life stay.
By dying, this woman had perfect life and released the person I loved, and here I found her full and full.
This detour of the way of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and outside," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a hard relationship with him until he was old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I was hurt...
He was talking to me, he was constantly encouraging me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, praying to him my body.
But it was never indiscrete.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they say? what would they think? what would they do?
I always dream about them, maybe not every night, but several times a week is sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this moment.
I wake up often angoissed when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams have me on the contrary and are part of my history and in fact they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was hitting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the stage, and he was smiling and rejoicing that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course he was a little boy in my belly.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am pleased to tell this common memory that has been lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died from cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor's house that I was at the time.
I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
To learn Arabic and to interest me in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master in a large school, have not been, with the back, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has inculcated to me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and right of mind of the one who was a fervently believing.
From now on, I feel it like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a salvant spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have passed through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying on my own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, uncomfortable moments.
And then, time has soothing the pain.
Only the lack, that vacuum without answer, that need of her, to entrust me, to reassure me of her softness.
But she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see his eyes worrying about me, I see the cherns that make his eyes light, the ridules around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the front on days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and my 3-child mother died of cancer at age 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself to my dreams when the moral is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the fall of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot take it out of your heart and memories.
In some way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
I couldn't see his burial, and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any event, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like a alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense penalty that then invaded me has of course diminished, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even saddest to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was fine, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a voice so real that I woke up by surpassing, angoissed and I turned on the ankle lamp looking everywhere, persuaded that he was going to arrive.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a business of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloody month since 2008
October has been the most murderous month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not saying to the world to be with us and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is going on in Iraq is not settled, it will extend, and what is going to happen in Syria will also extend.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by the Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the lord of crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool seating court.
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after compromising because of his habit of cocaine consumption.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals as a "major file," was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
The 32-year-old Sarborough was found by police officers to drop three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with confrères.
The investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because he feared that his addiction would be revealed in the open.
Today, at the Liverpool seating court, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being found guilty of two charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and tracked him coming to Ditta's home and putting drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the foot stadium of Ewood Park, the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went back home, discovered the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied to use cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and taken from him a sample of hair.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that there were times that clients called him home for legal questions.
But the court heard testimonies that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, "If someone must know that the law should not be violated, he is a penalist lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a penalist, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishonored him.
He has been too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal act and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta moved from criminal counsel to criminal counsel himself when he started to get drugs from criminal organizations."
His cocaine addiction has ever compromised him and made him vulnerable to the backbone of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest integrity rules and create a climate of public confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now of impediment to justice, attesting to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serve as a warning to the criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question / answer session on himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will go back to stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will occur on December 21 at the Sound Board at MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Ms. Franklin was involved in recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult."
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of her Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of sea edge covered with a light coat: we could take the hot shot in Menton with the illumination bill.
A factor that, unlike many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10: 00 in the morning local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there are at least two injured.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rush to the outlets or on the tarmac.
Very quickly the police force intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of a parking lot at the airport.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classic singing for adolescents
Each time, school clients will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vineyards with a high dose of humour, adolescents are allowed to apprivoise classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyrical Art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room comble at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the opportunity to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, Aero lyrique, the concert-profit held last August, with the support of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was an activity-benefit, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft at the ears as a bat air.
Without giving specific figures, the President of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is drawing well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and constant support.
"Finance is running out and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even beyond," added Executive Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage taking, sequestration, threat proferation, wearing a weapon in a dangerous design, abduction, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet by press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to come to court on Friday.
New request for collective action against the Holy Cross brothers
A new request for collective action has been filed against the Saint-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assault that would have taken place this time in the Saint-Joseph oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J," which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, the Submit brother, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratory, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only three institutions, and when the regulations were announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?" said counsel Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The collective remedy that has just been filed is unique in allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of St. Cross.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions in question closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the congregation of St. Cross and the Saint Joseph oratory, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children," that they "have exerted moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims," that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffocated them," and that they "have knowingly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem."
The latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research made in the archives on this subject by brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility is accepted by the Court, the second stage is the hearing on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the district of LaSalle in Montreal on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The relief was called around 1: 00 p.m. Friday, due to a fire that had been declared in the basement of an Indian kitchen restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the site took almost an hour to control the brasier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building structure," said the Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Security Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but close to 20 housing units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated provisionally, "said SIM.
A lot of opposition to medical help to die at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, held this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Quebec Medical Assistance Bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach would become minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejected the Bill on Medical Assistance to Death.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she regrets.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also Director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie House in Gatineau, is of the opinion that the service would be unnecessary in any case.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the lead.
For her part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, states that the concept of end-of-life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press blinds against controversial media law
"It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask itself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from balancing the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper by contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is drastic and very punitive, and we refuse it," said Cyrus Kamau, General Manager of Capital Group - Owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio and news sites.
He said that the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of government" and that content and advertising restrictions would be detrimental to Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and to refer it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "press the media." The Standard stated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and faded the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill is taking place at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security following the attack by armed Islamists in Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media were angry by the authorities by disseminating images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly robbed the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summoning was withdrawn following a lift of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "removed" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he or she has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere."
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and collecting."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the population's anger in the past.
In May, they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and re-established their mirobolant wages of about 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax - which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Laval Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) caused a whole emem to the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
As a result of multiple retirements, maternity leave or short departures, the Department of Pharmacies has found itself very low in staff.
Almost 30% of the required staff were missing, making this fiscal year "very difficult," according to the department's head, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent labour force, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the backup, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the establishment for a level, the time that things replace.
It's sure we worked hard to interest our [residences in pharmacy] young people to come and stay here.
There's a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, 2013-2014 is much easier for the CSSS Department of Pharmacies.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain these students have been fruitful, as the four students currently resided in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS's employment.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [number of staff] is still precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ many young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always run to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we have had much more and we have no pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model does not start his career at the cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose him to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This erotic pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two strands (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenary accro to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance with his elder is striking: a silhouette of brindille, a diaphane dye and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who did not hesitate to lay naked on ice paper will appear in much more sulphonous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full extase with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their dizziness in the closet, he used X professionals for the most osed sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses in their last retranchements, always for the best.
Stacy Martin's not done talking about her.
Narbonne's CGR room evacuated Thursday night
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of glittering by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility made the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people were out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad jokes on tear-mogen jet bottom?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is always that the director of cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in full.
The room was aerated and everything came in order.
The cinema has been able to take over its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images.
Only on screen.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkin
A woman, taking advantage of the Halloween day, tried to bring into the country two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkin on Thursday morning at Montréal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkin pumpkins that had been previously vided.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is she was coming to the country.
Since early 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range ground-to-air missiles SA-8 was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal aviation raid in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed either by Israel or by Syria.
The raid took place in about the same circumstances as that which had taken place on 5 July: at that time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting ground-sea missiles Yakhont, delivered by Russia in Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency lowered Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt rating is moving to "B-," which is embedded in the category of speculative investment.
It has a negative perspective, S & P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and plans that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of foreign credits.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, hryvnia, are collapsing, and the Agency is increasingly detrimental to devaluation, which would increase its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not having paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, furious of Kiev's will to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its indebtedness, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S & P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had given it a credit of $15.3 billion and had for the moment only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "significant external financing needs" were "a vulnerability," while noting "signs of economic improvement."
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect a short-term improvement."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, says the expert, interviewed at AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S & P also notes the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional upon the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short-term and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S & P explained, which fears "trade restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents one quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade area is established between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen border controls for imported goods.
United States Green Fire to the Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger is close to the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced review period for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, planned by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announced both groups in a communiqué.
They indicated that they also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts meet several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
"The merger is also subject to other regulatory authorities and the approval of shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army chase M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the bordering North Kivu of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being chased out of the localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it had been controlling since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We are going to sue the M23 and accuse it wherever it is hidden because it is a criminal," said Reuters, the FARDC spokesman, Colonel Olivier Hamuli.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyrdom of the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, a political rebellion leader, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change its claims to the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their apogee in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the leakage of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the largest in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawite and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters has been redesigned and the army has moved to an offensive against M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be reaching its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government was able to beat a major insurgency.
And this would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it farouthfully, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally made up of former mutined Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesperson for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following the shells falling into Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the people of Bunagana invaded the streets of the Burgundy to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to be one day liberated by the army," a resident of this neighbouring locality of Uganda testifies.
"We have lived in terror (M23), we are traumatized," said this man.
The tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
He said that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date."
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already done about 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday a decrease in its quarterly profit due to the decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in withdrawal from the group's objectives.
Its third quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, one year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from the 2.52 million bpj produced one year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with an increase of 25% of the production expected by 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a declining net profit, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Elementary transportation: the complaint found admissible
The Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) has been demanding $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) from the beginning of the school year for students receiving two-residence school transportation, a service that the organization is in a position to do so.
Prior to changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the Commission and I was interested in," says Ms. Lefèvre.
In her view, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to work together and to find solutions," says Ms. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the emergency closure of the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the frond for several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "delay the time frame for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency that will not be able to intervene on 4 November."
A formal request "to avoid any risk of taking care of the emergencies in Paris early in the winter" but which was also intended not to hinder the PS campaign at a few months from the municipalities.
Despite departmental instructions, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Although, in the HPA, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about one quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the Hotel-Dieu emergency will all have been instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hotel-Dieu, the emergency interns will leave place on Monday to five general medical interns.
The transfer of internal medical beds is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency service of the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," ensures without detour Loïc Capron, the president of the APHP Medical Board (CME), which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no longer patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome emergency patients," he tempts, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay there, he also assures.
But it is up to the SIA to decide whether to close the emergency service.
"Things are being done gradually," said Nicolas Péju, spokesperson for the ARS for whom on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or they lied to him," deplores urgent doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Removed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the fronde against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision made by "the médico-administrative technostructure."
"They are viding and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
"If other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly embraced.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at Lariboisière's emergency.
At SIR, it is argued that 30 "dispatched" patients at several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both RSAs and HPA are advocating the "new hospital model" that has been in operation since October 7 and is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general doctors should also be involved in the development of a "ambulatory care permanence."
"Where are we going if people are asked to self-diagnose themselves," asked Gérald Kierzek for whom "the most serious emergency concept" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression."
This is going to happen as for level 3 nursery.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where there is the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the braquet, says Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a Paris UMP advisor and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announced that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we were back to responsibility."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again reminded France Inter on Monday morning that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, "said Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the bottom, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of deferral to other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its listeners on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take hands in the NSA listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal.
Interrogated on this subject, an US government official said: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, he did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listeners of the Onu headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
United Nations welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now start working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to "go beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision for the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing together with conflicts between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scander peaceful slogans during a rare public event.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, general director of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd in the place of the Independence of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodese, governed by white people, and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy since the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 Md of investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the root of recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said on Wednesday to AFP, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"It is two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who continue to fight," said Joseph Hanlon, an open university speaker and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them can negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the votes collected by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza - who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
It is not known exactly what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South motorway axis.
Most of the clamps took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, particularly Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has reinforced the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abduction.
"People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is for it to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to roads," he added.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's legend could show that "brutal force does not make weight against subtle ruse," while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "much too violent, much too scandalous and in some cases much too obscure to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" means that children "fall completely," the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known base of what is shown and not said.
One Hamas armed branch fighter was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank shot in the Gaza Strip, was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between Palestinian territory and Israel when they wiped a shells shot by an Israeli armor.
NSA spying: the United States has "gone too far," Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, "said Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington aveu in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I confess to you, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this no longer happens in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London, at which he has been participating since Washington on Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004, and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since unleashed many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects upstream," the boss of American diplomacy argued.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he was reconsidering these practices so that no one felt wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swollen this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR," and led with the British NSA counterpart, GCHQ, allows both agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by Internet giants.
One of the documents was that some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - from metadata on emails to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In the face of the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such listeners, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even referred the bullet to the European intelligence services who would have seized these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would be about "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not be about Europe, "said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a large international espionage network that has also led to China's ire.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco unlike goals, has broadcast the list of players selected for this 12th-day game, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The release simply states that he is "injured," without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned to his selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the Dead Creatised
The Crematorium of Father Lachaise is organizing a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the deceased creatized in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, is to attend, and will then explain at a press conference his proposals for funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsèques, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a close man, it is the opposite: the French prefer the burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee for the Ethics of the Funeral, insists on the "violence" of cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence made to the loved body," which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which "would complete the phases of mourning."
There is also "symbolic violence," which is due to the "erasing of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without delay in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," said Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprivoise it.
Apprivoiser la crémation, c'est pour François Michaud-Nérard, directeur général des Services funéraires de la Ville de Paris, prévoir pour le défunt une cérémonie aussi digne que celle à laquelle il aurait droit avec une inhumation.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one for their relatives, whether religious (53%) or civil (24%).
From now on, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the remission of ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who conduct, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to host the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to link it to others, to evoke it, to give sense to his death, to organize the farewell.
This has been the case in the Crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have reconverted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were created in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online to those who could not travel.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, rehousing due to rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left his apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Land Office has proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to relocate the couple and his three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken exaggerated proportions, according to Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
Rats have always been in cities.
The deratization company realizes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have made 64 interventions since last winter.
The neighborhood is not left behind, and the rats are not pulling in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite rats at home," defends the family father who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without the sou and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has been affected by the decline in the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to export values and by the warning of Sony's annual result on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) at 14 201.57 and the Topix gave 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony fell by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house prey to flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 Hebert Street.
The flames were found in a three-house house on four floors behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled one hour after the arrival of fire-fighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"So the alarms succeeded, because it was taking backup to attack the building, because it was buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly before the public, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it is taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the poster heads emerged at the Carolines, and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes," a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at the Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has grown up, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival are passing through non-traditional circuits, for example by presenting shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable chain ("The League" on the theme of FXX's joyfully lascif football fantasy) and now has his own sketches show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the series "Parks and Recreation," but she is more known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (the surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attracting factors for the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he conducted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at the City Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he was descending an alley between two buildings and thinking, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here.
The price of oil continues to fall and is close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is growing.
The price of the US reference gross for delivery in December decreased from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Energy Department reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen in the last two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by the US refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Responding to the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal re-established certain restrictions on the right of voluntary interruption of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State which largely challenged the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal ruling means that doctors who practice GLs will have to have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
The IVG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be close to 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a judge of first instance had held on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, the republican Greg Abbott, who bribes the position of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the trial judgment that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has been able to return to a strong audience, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates came to the 10th season to meet the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement to find their favorite program, many have been disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first bonus.
As every year, the first hearing shows brush a wide range of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them have found their account there.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even have gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked on Thursday a judge's decision requiring changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and drew it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and related training program.
The Court of Appeal heard Tuesday the arguments concerning the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be drawn from the file because it had violated the judge's code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's critics.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and men of Hispanic origin as part of their monitoring and search programmes.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and supervision reform, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has been in place for decades in some form, but the number of controls registered has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that were mainly related to black men and men of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
The supporters advocating changes in NYPD's control and search program say they will put an end to unfair practices, make it possible to have more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money, and do not solve the broader problem of pressure police forces after police personnel have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way NYPD was implementing its controls.
The tenants must go to vote because each one of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We have to increase rents to help us pay new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 fireworks, $4-5 million land in case...
Go vote, this is the best way to express you and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef cuisinier de l'Elysée
Entered in the 500 m2 elysean kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the kitchenette graved every step until becoming a leader nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including in their holiday places, and fed an incalculable number of great people of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a CAP of pastry.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologna.
"I have passed from one castle to another!," ironises Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the Elysée's kitchens!
Do not deplore those heads of state who had a relative indifference to the land's nourritures, "they are all gourmet," he gently denounces.
Jacques Chirac had certainly "a little more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were coming back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much that he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who has returned the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime."
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée kitchens, who took a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart. "François Hollande came to greet me."
He said a lot of praise.
"His human side came out," he said.
The chief will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been in Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-dwelling building, located at 15 Hebert Street, was subject to three alarms at the fire service.
The fire declared itself at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Service de protection contre les incendies de Québec, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fire to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in a close manner.
The burnt house had four houses, but no tenants were at the site at the time of the fire.
The damage was quite limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the firemen have discarded the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese let some images out of his next film, whose role-title, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to tear you up in his role as a disgraceful trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange broker, who refuses to work with the authorities in a large corruption case in Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort then climbed up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizziness that will follow.
With no limits, man is shutting parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excesses of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2: 45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to take part in the race in the oscars.
Coulson used the phone hacking to check a hose
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidonic hose on an affair involving then-in-office Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said before the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and "permanently planting in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house by hoping to surprise them, it is the kind of man to love to present history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about telephone piracy?
He says the opposite, but we say "Of course we do."
The rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first taken up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer that concerned Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, "said Mr. Edis.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's least facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow, which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied having conspirated with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The US President was to receive Friday, November 1, 2013, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, in search of help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence over the past five years.
Iraq experienced its most murderous month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations is even higher with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence are increasingly murderous despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated Nouri Al Maliki Government.
The total number of deaths in October has been highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
Around two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence feared a new embrace while neighbouring Syria was in the midst of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funeral.
Men are shot in the middle of the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of political marginalization and of being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and to the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the US interviews of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At that time, the US President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and Congress elected.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to conduct a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy."
They also required Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses a Uyghour group of Tiananmen 'attack
The Chinese head of internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the trapped car attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, fell on the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression conducted in 1989, and took fire killing his three passengers and two passagers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uyghurs, a turcophone minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there through independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," said Meng to the Hong-Kongaise Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, with his words being taken over by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uzbek origin and indicated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious enrollment.
The incident resulted in 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican Profiles on Contraceptive, Divorce and Homosexuality
The Vatican has begun to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce and couples of same-sex people.
The survey asked participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the ties of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with the instructions to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter," an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in the appropriate way to sonder the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks rebel's last fief
The M23 irreductible, a few hundred fighters, were retranched at about 2000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, fighting continues in spite of the night," said an AFP resident of Jomba, joined by phone around 12.30, and according to whom a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little away."
According to this witness who wanted to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before coming up to the front for a "sweeping operation."
It was very clear behind him that small arms-fed crunches were being heard.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "a final phase," with the FARDC "encircling the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them."
Since the resumption, Friday, of the clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support for intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozens of soldiers, well-equipped with ammunition, went up to the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, military personnel assisted civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC truck, to ensure the rotation of another aircraft flying M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called again on Wednesday night the rebels to "voluntarily demolish" under peine of being disarmed "by force," but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing unsuccessful since December for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, only Ugandan mediation remains to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without that information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its basement is surrounded by coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed in the mid-day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to take us back," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including a baby on his back.
We feel like gunshots are getting closer to people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on the head, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, productions singed and danced take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: French music stands out as a successful kind.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts would stop in ridicule.
And the successes like Cabaret or The Miserable wore the auréole of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the line.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as successful tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady, announces for the next one the world creation of "An American in Paris."
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" could well be one of the success of the season.
On other scenes, music shows such as "1789," "Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are deflecting success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for so hard-conquered success.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has increased.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve with the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful images projections and a real story like in 1789, the Amants de la Bastille.
Others make a 15-year leap back on the pretext that we can serve about anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the poster.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us live Broadway's golden age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment populates a variety of Anglo-Saxon musical comedies by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent," "Le Baiser de la femme spiée" or "L'Eveil du printemps" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it is a great year.
We have 200 talent artists that turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, toured, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The vivier of talents is as much as the number of positions to be filled.
Why do provincial tours have so much success?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults rather than young adults.
The music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who like telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful (often talented) young men at the top of a musical show is the assurance of a rush of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are tastefully held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provincial.
The show is designed to enter all large rooms in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at around 5: 30 p.m., on the inside ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free from him.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9: 00 a.m., in place of the accident, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause much congestion as the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart Exit.
The traffic was therefore deviated by this exit / entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital pronostic is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean."
She was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assaults
Children play on a carbonized armoured that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took Bugina's hill, overlooking Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
There will be only Runyonyi's hill.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," AFP said to North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last strong place of rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreductible M23, are retranched at about 2,000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring locality of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "calm since this morning."
According to him, a woman and his child were killed by the fighting of the day before and buried.
One girl was shot, and three other people were injured, including a rush, evacuated by FARDC, added this witness cited by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not reported any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase business paranoia with respect to state surveillance
By a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital at low altitude.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation had led to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Intelligence Director, again insisted in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who has become a denouncer, began to unveil his invaluable treasure of information about US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on parole.
Reports that the United States National Security Agency spy on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, particularly Google and Yahoo, have more than ever been the source of business paranoia with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase unleash.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the EY consulting firm.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capacity and that it should endeavour to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, President of the German Business Software Company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the magnitude and sophistication of the American espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock for some companies that so far thought that China was the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, since European officials have become aware that the data kept in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the US Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our clients today ask us a question that they were not asking us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
"It has been a recurrent subject for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level as we spy on us, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in the event that this leaves the advantage to an opponent.
The large companies have long been smarting the message that it is at least imprudent to recover a free USB key at a professional lounge or to leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automobile manufacturer Audi, states that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple pre-paid mobile phones during their travel abroad due to the risk of damage to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," says BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted by the United States in February, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were responsible for the second degree of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French Director of Internal Intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a young man from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling carpet in his high school gym, think their son was murdered, said family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January stuck in a carpet standing behind the gymnasium gradins of his high school.
Investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family contests these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it defies any logic, the laws of physics as well as the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person (s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartable and were returned to them in a mortuary bag," he added.
United States Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis for an official investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by "positional asphyxia."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements that can justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all videosurveillance records that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents said they hoped that the video images contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has increased sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffer from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of child food allergies among the faculty and staff, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine - the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used - to be able to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative assemblies have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
Kids can say, "I feel like something picks my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on the language" or "I have picotements on the language."
The NSA case underlines the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, who, on one side, is in public offended by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, based on the rumor of the presence on his side of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks apart from the replication of American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the listeners of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks sails over the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to tell us about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by NSA on terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The introduction of very powerful technology interception tools by the United States, but also by France, over the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established quasi-daily procedures for cooperation and exchange of information, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French through NSA means.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to have interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within the Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be their, and ultimately the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk of a deterioration in the image of the United States?
I don't know how they can be punished.
The American risk can be double.
The first is when their allies - and that has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest summit in their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have continued.
Another effect may be more cost-effective: more and more European or South American companies are relying, in the light of the revelations, on entrusting their confidential data to American suppliers subject to US law, and therefore to the NSA's right-of-way.
Last element: the vast movement of revelations by media around the world, which helps to initiate a debate on intelligence surveillance practices until then almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborn children will no longer be attributed, in a rigid manner, to birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to report the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their child, and to combat discrimination against intersexual persons.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, contusioned and scalded.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexued, as intersexuality is part of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexual.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgical action, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can be manifested on their own in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pill, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudices.
Young non-compliant boys now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning his appeal trial that allows him to keep a "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F-X for intersexued, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this country, which is a genuinely Catholic, signed a petition for "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, we overthrow two other pillars of civilization."
In Maryland, a child's mother also reported on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies when they were born.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just ten years ago, the medical community considered the genre to be a slate, which can be erased and on which we can redraw.
But now, many are those who challenge the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"By the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malléable.
He set out the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as being male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John / Joan," his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a torn circumcision to have him castled fully, by also removing the testicles, and raising him like a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he returned to a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say if he had a broad clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and got his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "invites to labelling and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child" undetermined "sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law is about to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name of third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law "will be responsible" for parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffered from a DDS called complete androgen insensibility syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and in-house in child psychiatry at Pennsylvania University.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or wearing mothers.
"The law leaves parents some latitude to not have to make early decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time limit before registering "male" or "female."
So, everything is fine - you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for an irreversible surgery.
"This puts children at the heart of decision-making and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he / she feels the most comfortable - and it is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between the left and right within the ruling coalition in the approach to the Senate vote to disregard Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview with La Stampa, the left centre leader said that he "strongly intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his disappointment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated by his refusal on 2 October last to give up Berlusconi's injunctions that already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called to the scene of the drama claimed that they had responded to a call for "multiple injuries."
"The law enforcement forces are on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated to ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said an AFP spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a rod, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. local (12.30 p.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that teminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The spokesperson for TSA was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-Sces
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Islamist Palestinian activist on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, was learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas has explained that fighting in this region has broken down, as Israeli tanks have crossed the border and have been targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secret, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most important event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the close collaborators of the President had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his re-election while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the senior officials of the campaign and the White House, namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton on the voting.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been farouthfully kept within the Chicago campaign headquarters and within the Oval Bureau.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the President - including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama Jim Messina and former advisors at the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley said to the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the "concerted" exam, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns do not devote much money to polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, we don't know if Obama was aware that his team was looking at the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible redesign.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not ultimately answer the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Do you want a flue ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first mellow-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent collation.
He had the idea of it after reading a study on the meduses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the more shiny it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I am Delicious," said: "This is something incredible but we are still only in the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary shiny effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I created because the luminescence of the meduses is worth four times as expensive as gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
But she has a pretty good taste!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for his unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold sheet.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died when he was doing tai chi exercises, revealed Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and carried out the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musician who made the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband the week before her death to get him out of the hospital and take him to their Springs house (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are citadins, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will give many people the great joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and taste us to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pissed.
Over the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it this year.
But the stats show that I am the slut sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million in fact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
Disguises are expected to be $1.2 Md out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimated sexy objects are running away.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men of Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no problem staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal disguises this year, according to NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't tap.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 million in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sugars, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go to the candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, don't tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Candy corn is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls," "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenues, according to America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you pissing on you that your friends put on Facebook and that you cannot remove and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the "pretty head" style.
I mean, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were a little girl.
Fortunately for us, the "pumpkin baby trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potirons and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, the Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkin that gently flush on your house's porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkin were grown this year.
If you are looking for more notice, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create in-house a bad bank structure of 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it within three years.
RBS also said that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional doubtful claims of £4-4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release between Pound10 and Pound11 billion capital, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a touch on the past, with the government in particular being accused of ingesting in RBS management.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and about 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has 6-point baquet seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, General Manager of Bowler Motorsport said: "Rally lovers who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of rally raids.
We have had a lot of pleasure to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle - the championship will really be palpitant. "
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable corniche in a career.
Ruby, a cocker epagneul, had escaped after a road accident without gravity.
She was identified three days later by a person who was walking her dog stuck in the career.
The firefighters came down as a reminder along the cliff to get the dog back and save her from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to safely recover it while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable saillie of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker epagneul, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They had desperately sought their lost bitch and made a call to social network sites after she disappeared in the career as a result of an unserious accident.
At about 2: 15 p.m. Wednesday, a person with a curved view walking his dog found Ruby on a corniche in the career, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton firefighter's barracks rush to the scene and went down as a reminder to save Ruby using a animal stretch to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely didn't move during the rescue - she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after that.
It was a very unusual call.
It's unbelievable someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby has had a lot of chance to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for control; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by observing relief."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were awesome.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid that she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never dreamed Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He dreamed me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger representative said that he "categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she's congruing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism," landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chinese Security Boss to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a particular organization after the Monday attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighours of the same family in the dominant Muslim region of Xinjiang, a border of several Central Asian countries, precipitated their car loaded with gas bidons against the entry of the prohibited City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear passports control stories in Berwick and a border of barbed sons along the wall of Hadrien.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the big titles (and it was to be expected).
Nor did anyone say that EU Member States spend much of their time bypass their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at this time, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now stuck: I heard for the first time the coil that "independence means control of passports" over 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke against the Brussels yoke, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead point.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties who oppose the EU or are advocating for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent of our liberals-democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the carcan on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits - this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has placed exchange rates on its members that are favourable to German exporters - what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of South Europe are faced with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only resort is to make dark cuts in public wages and expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort with productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason for subsidizing French and German energy companies at consumer expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is an editorial disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage gels in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American schist gas.
As a result, the revolt is growing, especially in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy unsuccessful.
As a result, the Extreme Right Party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the socialists to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds it that it cannot be based on the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European block in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are to be well represented in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will look more like "Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" privileged free by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distances from this project, and I hope that it will have a soft eye in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland, all of this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could take care of a more free European agreement provided we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Nova Scotia SNP government is - and it is to be noted - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Checker, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative / Liberal-Democrats coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Old age earlier
Studies show that Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair start to grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American young people and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as bosom bubbles, hair under arms and in the pubic zone and body odours, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while in 1970 it was 12 years three-quarters.
"Once the chest has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most precise test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before age 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops - it's something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify testing by an endocrinologist to remove serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can hinder growth and a small size at adult age.
Drug and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioural problems and the feeling that young girls are different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came back from the frightened school and was upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages transmitted by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6-9 that links the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
At the global level, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and all-small.
"We must be careful about how we identify the real appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatricians to know how to speak with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the people of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Coen brothers, the Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that just started to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been retrospective to the French Cinema, had flourished the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen threw their stroll on the rising American film star Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humor film where music is a central character and live songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself a successful musician and singer of folk, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich atours in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less lively clothes, a sweet voice when she sings, but the juron spilled the machine gun when she spoke.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't perch and get mad with the whole land.
He accepts to turn back the replacements at the foot raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes a tour of his friends' canapés who still want to receive him.
A documentary look
"His relationship with success is tortured, this is what was of interest to us: a mixture of misfortune, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a career-maker but integrates, with self-destructive behaviour," said Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York district called to become "the epicentre of the growth of folk music that would cause international stars" as written by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes up documentary looks, the invaded dusty music label of 33T unsold inhabited by an old unbearable secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafés where the singers were taking place.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character that crosses the film constantly: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis's companion of fortune.
Asked about how he made up his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, swim by blues and the country."
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good," "chance can also start someone's career," and "more and more today."
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on her music, the star pop explains that in a career, "most important is not to be stuck by everything that can prevent us from expressing us."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," is dead.
He never knew the word retreat.
Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin."
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theater of the 198 and 199s opus of the famous series of spy novels.
He was physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, and moved with a deambulator during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he was also left in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul," the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 million and 150 million all countries," he moved forward last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the lounge of his immense apartment of a building on Foch Avenue just a step away from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not to mention pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the table between the bronzes or ivens reported from the 130 countries surveyed to place his novels there.
For the price of a package of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a photo of a young woman in the advantageous chest, wearing a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serenitim alterness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat discarded and contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the reparations of the family castle, launches to the kits of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, then jihadists from the 1990s onwards.
At each book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitical and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," Gérard de Villiers explained.
I see myself as a word that writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters of the Albert London type, who went there and returned with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical slip."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before leaving," said Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some of them for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: so, one month before the attack of a Syrian regime command centre having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Way."
In "The Fous of Benghazi," he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "Cairo conspiracy," one year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako," he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists that were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a guess, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he moved for a month behind his 1976-year-old IBM marguerite writing machine "all of which have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
At the walls of his office are clamped with AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and the author's photos with African warlords.
Regularly spelled for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organisations, Gérard de Villiers discarded these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, smart and brave women.
I am still welcome to Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all the heroes, is no age."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than me.
The saviors argue about the width of the seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute between the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical fair which takes place months ago.
The conflict is about the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to economic class passengers - which are not always the most crowded by airlines, but where the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as airmen sought to sell even larger versions of their long-bimotor airplanes, possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the seats will be placed at the rear of the aircraft - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats - is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange shots on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai aeronautical fair, where the 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realise recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turbopropeller aircraft," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As dietary habits change, people grow up, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-mail travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the American Department of Health.
The average American tower of the twenty-first century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is clinging to a siege concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly called jet set aircraft was narrower.
Airbus added that it commissioned a study that indicates that an additional thumb in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's numbers with respect to seat width and states that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that cabin experience is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
"It is really a question of providing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want us to tell them what will allow them to be cost-effective.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race at the command of aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at market price in the coming decades, sufficient to bring the balance of US and European exports down.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what nourishes the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their last models of long-haul converters 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this to get more seats and make his aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passager at European Airbus Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert in cabins Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who are around the world even take one metre with them to check the competing configurations.
While selling to offer comfortable devices, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more customization of the cabins by offering larger seats on some of its airplanes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large equipment, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aeronautical industry to put in place a size standard for the aboutisse seats, but that he could forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle's shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle's shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and general director Larry Ellison, in view of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but comes to defuse the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just won by his boat's victory at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May because of the group's bad performance, which failed its growth goals, but he received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
In 2013, the net profit of Oracle increased by 3.5%, while the stock exchange price was 27.5%, overperforming the S & P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could remove smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his or her nicotine dose.
In the tests, vaccinated mice that was then given nicotine continued to operate normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothing," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proved ineffective because they contain antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it will help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
The head of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The head of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, was learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But officials of intelligence, the army and the militant movement have said this time that he had lost his lives in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a high security officer.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied having changed the commercial leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
She now investigated allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has put pressure on leases to be subject to a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's companies, which reported to the Obeid about $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government leases policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived in the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial leases policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi said.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least it wasn't about that.
At least certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says one responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia Thursday night, confirms a military official at Fox News.
The person in charge did not specify what was the target, but said there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel conducted air strikes against missile cargo in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently considering the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to hold unqualified positions or as a diverted means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as the working MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The scary statements on" strangers returning to the end "and" jobs for Australians first "are a disagreeable return at the time when trade unions were asking for a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the White had to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working paper identifies the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be controlled to determine "whether the offer of employment is authentic in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking."
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually used hundreds of them.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker would have died from a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The affoled son of the man, 9 years old, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 is opened in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "would bring together the United Kingdom."
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "excited" about working with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 million to £42.6 million.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of travel for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel periods between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer."
We are pushing the HS2 project because its benefits are enormous.
Without him, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocal" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland to the overall high-speed rail project throughout Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
The rules for the use of electronic devices on board are still in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the United States gesture to ease the regulation of electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do so for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by air," she said.
The issue is subject to regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but stated that it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a CASA revision that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the client experience now that we have (the entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it was currently in compliance with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as revising manuals, training equipment, hand luggage programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has checked the safety of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In the few cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a 30-person grabbing according to the testimonies collected...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was shaken on the side of Pia where a rixe involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four light injuries are to be deployed.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the site to separate the belligerents and ensure that the injured were taken care of.
Singapore pledge lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to shake the belt
At a pledge lender at the Bendemeer mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts down a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the tuition fees of his daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," said Amirthalinga.
Although she wins $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband is also working, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is increasing - that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, has become this week the third-largest loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Paying jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash - $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders collect an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund lessor with a branch in the same mall.
However, pledge lenders have the advantage of not applying for solvency checks or proof of pay, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to lenders on a pledge while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and overindebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit fuelled by a monetary policy that is too laxist in advanced economies, low and medium-income families turn to lenders on pledge to close the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency cited the growing indebtedness of households, mainly due to the increase in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household / gross domestic product debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while this rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs, people in the middle or down [of the wage scale] seek to complete their income as they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people eager to pledge their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledge in the 200 state-city loan shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge the gold chain of grandma and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the loan-on-loan sector that ValueMax, the shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where he already has four shops - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his general manager.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have wiped the criticism for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah states that biasing not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Clients mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she said.
Billing is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to lenders on pledge are not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore's easy people also go to ValueMax loan shops to pledge gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from every layer of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that have cash requirements to make a difficult course," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was looking after young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was official, said he was deeply saddened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before he gets chased out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred by a brassard with the gammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, clients complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from clients, so we asked him to leave the store," said a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "as long as it came, he was already gone without slander," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were bugging.
"You don't go out on the street unless you want to draw attention," a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, testified at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to taste as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining "mental problems."
$325 M Rescue Plan for the Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the cowardly health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "urgent action" to end a crisis caused by the aging of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after consultations by the government with the independent Member of Parliament for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the area of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for non-appointment clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training medical staff, mental health services, and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," Plibersek said.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The Government will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the Government for responding to his urgent request for assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the opponent's spokesman for health, Peter Dutton, thinks today's announcement is a "fortune solution."
"The reason we are here is that the government's labour government has removed $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government that rains almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and we can't pretend it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is aimed at a remarkable artistic direction and a careful replenishment of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
She was in France in the 1760s and told the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unborne cruelty of a Sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spends in lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The solemn consciencious narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost 3 years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline of
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious time frame to destroy the chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Of these, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hizbollah activists.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
The Al-Assad troops have been fighting against the rebels, many of which have been linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fighting has underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they must complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues in a tight time frame.
A statement by OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled - and had been destroyed - all declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling."
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors reported that they had completed the first phase of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, "said the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been displaced to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the context of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the Al-Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Aaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he added.
Coler caused by the sentence imposed against one of Bali's bomb posters
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed against the last conspiracy to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution peloton.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running away from being one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for attacks against two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on the Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked for the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision ravaged hard memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the edge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the execution peloton," said Ms. Corteen to the PAA.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an outside parked van, exploded just after 11: 00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He plunged in the coma in the aftermath of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "died" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - that were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bomb posters to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former Al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that reports from the intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't go," Corteen added.
Until recently, he was mocking the sorrow that he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music - but not speak on their mobile phone - under the new very expected directives issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft are in compliance with the new directives and that they have updated the crew training manuals and the aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the near future," said the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on before the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and do not reactivate them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-off, landings and ground rolling, "said the FAA.
Most new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, expressed satisfaction with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with the carriers for that - it will benefit everyone," said Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-style game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was deported to a high-noise American Airlines aircraft after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptop computers will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to FCC, that they could disturb mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid safety reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
The airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of line aircraft are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, "said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower-power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
For example, e-book readers only issue minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices upload or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a Kindle e-book reader line aircraft and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to feel mixed about whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought that interference from devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft may interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under conditions of low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them for good-sense arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heritreuiled bird from a North Sea platform has been released into nature
A bird, hélitreuillé after being found exhausted on a oil platform in the North Sea, was released into nature.
The water grill was mounted on board a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was put back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water grill was probably a wintering migrator who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have been able to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water grill was healthy when released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring business together and to define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the widest and most comprehensive survey from British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, generally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than enlivening in the long and arduous process of reform of European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their views on specific political issues - from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has led to general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area - 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that gives back power in the United Kingdom.
The challenges are high - to achieve a change in the Treaty and to better represent Britain's interests would allow a 16% change in voting for the continuation of the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for companies this means refocusing trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed friandises to hundreds of invited children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy's passage.
This year, the fêtards have been catching up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" district.
Everyone is overexcited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I could finally put on the suit I planned last year.
We're having fun like fools, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's a good child, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan party celebrated on the eve of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline is opening a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom's director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, Gazprom's general manager, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security on the whole of the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas for Europe is transited, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, says the Director.
Miller added that direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction is expected to start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wishes to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Thursday the daily Tahiti News, taking information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, with three other small islands close to it.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutinees of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English Navy which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, most of the descendants of the Bounty mutinees, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836.000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Great Britain to validate this request.
The mayor of Pitcairn, Mike Warren, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to shrink these 836.000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
France already has to carry out the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, neighbour of Pitcairn.

Lifestyle prison for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, in northeastern China, was sentenced Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched over 19 million yuans of bribes, reports official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first middle court on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intraitable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been condemned, among which former executives of the Petrochina oil giant.
The most recent case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions within the state.
But the government has not shown any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and one YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate by underlining, "external controls of YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second assessments on four institutions during an audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years' imprisonment.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of children's safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, indicated that she found the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, responsible for child services, who would support Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their senior executive.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations that they had with Lord had blurred their judgment, so that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his point of view before the New South Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organization, the lesson from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "reporting" by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff signed confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA's Director General for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was "too much zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual violence, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have said, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many equestrian experts met in Cardiff to fight and win the Cheval of the Year Trophy, they knew that the competition would be rude.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the alumni and his Poney Shetland Toffee trotted during the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable - which are of the same size - were greeted for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Coming against men and women in elegant melons hats, he was wearing his flat cap a little on the side in a casual way to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee poney around the runway.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of uncommon dressage for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and his personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third anniversary last March and has been training since with his Poney Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo."
They presented themselves to and against all, but both flourished the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy of joy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been involved in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it."
He went through the whole length of the runway running and even if he seemed to be a little, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
From the way he started, he will probably soon participate in the Cheval of the Year demonstration - and I am sure he will do a good performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his poney."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they parked on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the dresser - Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that made a call "will be remanded"
A Chinese newspaper that made a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redrafted, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will be subject to "complete rehandling," the regulator said.
The order of "rehandling" originates from the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's writing was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete redesign of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation of the responsible persons at New Express and immediately remantle the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a building gear manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the first page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
A number of important suspects have recently made television confessions.
The specialists say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to criminalize himself.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a rush.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear heaters in mid-October and while the boat was at sea was "safe for the sailors," but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has confirmed "the unavailability" of the vessel until "mid-November," "the time to take the necessary corrective action" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a specialist in the defence navy, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched in the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier."
This is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failure heater.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not question the ship's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
It should be recalled that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is coming out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had dressed from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young pilots as hunting.
A "small damage," confined to the reactor containment space, had then occurred on the amiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a very dissatisfaction from the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax relief, the cost of all kinds of permits, administrative costs to no longer end.
Anyway, no limit siphonage of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow taxation that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money forcibly removed from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuary expenditure and the maintenance of the boiling ducks: the lack of a cultural centre, a strong subsidy to the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are not cost-effective, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also unfortunate to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I am giving an honorable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax-paying companies?
It is not for public levels to invest in such enterprises, but for the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fisheries and Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in population, water use has declined significantly throughout the country.
Without means wasting it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravates with most beautiful degrees and I don't think a sheep breeder is doing worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the 4-foot by 3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant over a length equivalent to almost six long football grounds, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with indefinite warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing unnoticed, said the authorities.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intention of sale.
They are sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment if sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, making it a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that were from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who was a refugee at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "notice of surrender" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking her to come to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fear that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of remission against a 40-year-old man who asked him to come to a police station at the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange feared being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Finish the passwords to type to access his smartphone or pay his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this rush for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission on Informatics and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and at any time," said Justin Brookman, who is responsible for the privacy of consumers within the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in one, and pessimism in another?
Biometry will be based on new techniques, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people working on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unlegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a safety - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as the recognition of the face or iris (the colourful part of the eye).
As a result of increased sensor accuracy and computer computing capacity for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, Director of Accenture R & D Laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
As a unique and infalsifiable marker, DNA is also a source of hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase of 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the crime scene in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the person she claims to be).
The identification was so far concerned with the issue of identity documents: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be confronted with the information that the State has on all the citizens already stranded.
This makes sure that a person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We are recovering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for NEC France's commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use is to photograph a quidam in a store, to track its progression through facial recognition and to calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (computer opening).
In addition, more recently, the presence control.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a boyfriend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, particularly those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to remove money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric player: this gesture replaces the secret code hit.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and large distribution signs: when paying in store with its bank card, the client does not tape his code, but introduces his finger into a player that scans his veins.
The experiment is planned for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Trails to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that she can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a client remains in cash 30 seconds less, it is appreciable," says the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which blokes if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, because of the lack of extensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver rolling at 210 km / h with a hot drink between the legs was inflicted an almond of £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km / h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old from Tiptree in Essex, was found driving his Mercedes Benz on A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surtax of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to break the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally encrypted the measure of capital gains tax but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, has entered a stamp fee of 7% for properties that cost more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents £708 million over fiscal year 2012 / 13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance law, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are underimposed independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The prestige real estate - the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market - in the prosperous sector south-west of London that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record percentage of 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-to-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing "internal market," the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%), according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog's tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs were more stirring their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs were stirring it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Thirty, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left and right side of the brain are involved in different ways in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that as well as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching films with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behaviour.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs films with other dogs - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor - and we have been able to track the tail movement and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression stirring the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog who stirred the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they found a dick deflected mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the retreat dog), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
He rather thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will reactivate according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and dressers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canin Behaviour Expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, stated that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that the dogs were turning their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs are going more easily to a robot dog when his tail is moving to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He indicated that differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robots dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports concert to Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys carried a concert to Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with his singer.
The Sheffield group was expected to occur on Friday in the The Hydro concert room in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that he cannot perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any disapproval caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket shop where you bought your tickets for any further help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope - it is therefore up to a group of 120 "cardinals voters."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesperson, said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the Constituent in advance from February to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voice said that by February, the number of cardinals will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as it needed for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis's election in March this year, said Valero.
At present, there is some kind of tendency to focus on Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to examine ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
"From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "quite possible" for François to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the papes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he will name."
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat back
General Motors Co reminds about 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado pickups and GMC Sierra 2014 to resolve a problem with manually inclined files, according to a statement on Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a flaw at the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) site.
The models recalled were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the pickups owners of the defect during the first 15 October.
NHTSA was unable to review the information letter to owners due to the 16-day stop in government operations, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 pickups Silverado and 16,503 pickups Sierra.
The GM stock course increased by 1.4% to $37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama occurred at about 11: 00 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this place for some time.
A mitoyan foundation wall had been built in recent days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived at the site to get her tools back.
I was going by car and I saw the wall crumbling with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who stays close to the site.
I landed and went to take off the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an older man in the 50s who worked for a coffrage company.
Reanimation maneuvers have been tried by the emergency services, but without success.
The man didn't survive his serious wounds.
An inspector of the Commission on Occupational Health and Safety was sent to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The shout of despair of an Obama elector
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts displayed by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope again.
He is called "The Audacity to Win" and is the memoranda of the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports in the evening and I lay down, this book takes me back at the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer explain.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the trespassing of foreign leaders, or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, or the indictment of denunciators that reveal the government's misconduct.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the overexpenditure of the presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to reduce the media to silence are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
And, more recently, she cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his application.
Mitt Romney had a confuse and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow her policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being free from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises that we have heard for so long.
However, while the positive opinion index has plunged under 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Priors.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to refocus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I do not agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, at about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Retinne Street in Flero.
The rider, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleron, didn't wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of the relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire Clive Palmer argued that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnet, which contests the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to dismiss issues concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were prepared to personally benefit from these policies.
"There will be a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer has put forward the idea of a redesign of the rest of the vote system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's girls, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Today, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously."
Public service is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York identified a new species of bosse dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, responsible for the scientific mission to the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Milieux Marins (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
You're surprised about the discovery of this new bosse dolphin?
It's good news, but I'm not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, family or even order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very close morphologically species have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific Booster Dolphins and Atlantic Booster Whales.
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could deal with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widely known on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered by the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the potential for recovery from neighbouring stocks.
As for the Sousa chinensis species, whose population of the new species was discovered, its stock automatically became lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We'd rather send robots to Mars, than know what lives in the Mariana pit, just 11 kilometres from the sea surface.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it is high time that it changes.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two foreign exchange dealers from two sources close to the file, which once again shows that the global investigation by regulators on suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the world's largest financial market surveys, where US $5.3 trillion are changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the enlargement of the investigation which echoes the scandal of the manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent records of e-mails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European currency trading officer at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Head of Foreign Exchange Trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, a senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been subject to any charges.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that he was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are examining allegations about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks have been spying out instantaneous messages and emails sent for years to find cases of misconduct.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of trading units of investment banks in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market for highly liquid exchange, but older traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trade management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost."
The news arrived on the same day that Credit Switzerland announced having sent a trader working in his office of the funds negotiated on the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of Credit Switzerland.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been built, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation "so shattered."
Mr. Ruby told La Presse canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested the casual friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, age 35, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, report new court documents.
Mr. Ruby described the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair made an informed choice not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have required an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The Chief of Police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Me Ruby's words as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to be claimed to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way.
At the press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal charge against the mayor.
The European Scholarships in decline at the mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Scholarships are moving down Friday to mid-session, plagued by some disappointing news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could denounce its policy of quantitative flexibility earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of an inflation of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street suggests an opening up of the rising American shares, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in CAC 40, plunged by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks EuroFirst300's worst performance, after also publishing downward results this morning and announcing the creation in-house of a bad bank structure of 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+ 2.45%) remains at the head of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that AT & T is studying a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculations on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are going well, as John Hardy, a Saxo Bank strategist, testifies.
The ECB's unique mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at next week's meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to decline against the US currency and has reached a lower two-week session at $1,3517.
In contrast, these same conjectures support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court today declared that the law of reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which requires citizens to enter into health insurance by 2014, subject to a penalty to pay a fine - and stated that it was constitutional under the government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which states that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid must be reduced under the penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election in Lice, including the named candidate Mitt Romney, have strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Cemetery of the Trabuquet, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MPs Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Accroying Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday, 31 October 2013 in the evening during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory over the past year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, after exhaustion of its fuel stocks, "said the Palestinian enclave Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a gunshot of tank shells during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion inside the territory before then withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell by defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to combat Israel, stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device against the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the Peter Lerner army.
Israel also struck an air military base in the north-west of Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Officials of the Israeli Government have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Calling "exclusive sources" that it did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse his two new group choreographs: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's inks and poems, the second insuffled by Satie's famous Gymnopedies piano solos.
An evening that allows to see all Chouinard's prism, art to the tics and black ink to the white.
A white screen is used as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, of profile, end as a line and clothed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole room: an embrace of physical imitations of the drawings.
Dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, rush when the next graph appears, embody it, come out in current.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in a relay of solos, in a group in unisson (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
It is thought of "Morning Gloire," where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm always fast.
There will be censure when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dancing carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the shouting, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to take back.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up dwarding and numbering.
As is also done the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hair that boils or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux 'work, has imposed himself, with his ticks.
Result: The bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux 'inks, like Gestalt shapes, open a larger, giboyeux imaginary than the porous dance.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers wrapped by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The public loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the entract, are richer.
The scene is partly gray-plated, dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an unleft house.
In piano, dancers are relying to play partitions.
Their misaddresses in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, the couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, sets that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Fucks appear, also familiar with Chouinard, boring the red nose, in very polarized male-female parades.
The lovers are carnassiers, fleeing or players.
The gestures, laughter and small shouting transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the cored bodies, of the beings that melt.
But the room takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back to stage when the public leaves.
Here everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superpose, the dancers cabotinent, descend among the spectators, glosent, smoke, short-circulate, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a tastefully calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it's Chouinard's art there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he hacked to the pole during the auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violation before the United States Court of Assignment in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly held by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising in connection with Internet search terms, have indicated the trial conclusions, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer 4.4 Md $.
After losing Nortel patents against Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 Md, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auctions, Google violated and continues to violate those patents," said the trial conclusions.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have turned on a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which made two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and his 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday night the replacement of the King's Attorney.
The expert dispatched on-site by the public prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital pronostic of both victims is still committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubed and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, her by ambulance," said bourgmestre José Paulet, descended to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
He was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase that was still intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, fragilised by the explosion, were rehoused by the president of the CPAS.
The fire fighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected President to oath
Mohamed Morsi has made the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the oath of investiture to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected President and successor to Hosni Moubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investiture in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the reversal of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He oath before the 18 judges in black dress of the Court whose building on the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better aftermath, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-waged organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were keeping the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11: 00 local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new President and, starting from the presidential fast of the Moubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass in the very popular streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the uncharismatic "rescue wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Moubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red tie suit, addressing the judges present in the room ornate of woodwork where he oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investiture speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national hymn while he was in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by the singing "The people and the army, hand in hand..." entailed by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a fief of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former evicted President, has laid him down.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is of practice, he inclines himself before the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA freed up the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal government has affected the growth of car sales in the United States in October, show the figures published by manufacturers on Friday, with five of the six major performing below expectations.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit show two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales in annualized and seasonally adjusted rates, but the market was estimated at 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's customers, he considered that this slight brake was explained in the first place by "the government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's sense during the first 15 months."
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The four brands in the group saw their trade performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales increase from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show sales below consensus, despite one-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM was winning 1.4% at 4: 35 GMT while Ford was giving up 1.1%.
Renault plumbed in stock exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault accuses on Friday the strongest decrease in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced having decreased by almost 20% its annual net profit forecast, report traders.
Nissan, who had to conduct such a review, also announced a redesign of his management.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning."
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Parisian broker's trading officer.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: Two dead in a shootout near a Neo-Nazi party local
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by gunshots fired by two people who were aboard a motorcycle that was passing in front of a local of the neonazi golden Aube party in the west suburb of Athens, was it learned from police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that gold Aube members had argued that the victims were guards of their local.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorism police dispatched to the central avenue of the suburbs of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Aube deputies, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of the Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against the Barça for a coup to Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said he was "very disappointed," considering that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to severe winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large area of Montreal also has its lot of outages with almost 7000 private current homes in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to overturn the trend.
The company has revised its forecast of net profit upwards and hopes for record results thanks to the vacations in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve an underlying benefit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before tax, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth over the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011 / 12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre had made 8% of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force, particularly with regard to non-business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the whole year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, compensating for a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector has had good results while business clients have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the whole year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Unknown bastards opened fire this Friday on a hotel close to the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making any victims, as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant employees.
The assailants fled, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, General of Police Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt has not received almost any tourist since the army discarded Islamist President Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and reprimanded the protests of its supporters in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The review will also provide "new texts" to encourage more diversified reading.
A course combining English language and literature will be deleted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass an independent GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and Maths programs tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Bureau of Examinations Regulators, will reveal a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and less courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence," insisting that ESGs would be "more stimulant, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth mathematics - as well as the greater importance given to subjects in international classements - would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of course.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State which largely challenged the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenar welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were doorway-to-door to claim candy on Halloween's night.
One of the riders of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, age 86, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun was seized.
The former Gestapo leader buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common pit in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily on large-scale drawing using archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great riddles of the Post-War.
The German secret services, the BND, provided that during the summer of 1949 Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
Secret services were completely wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a provisional grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his state of service with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district hall of Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
May one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossièrement crowded," he insurged into the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Heroes of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternately times of consciousness and unconsciousness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma whose sequelae he was going to wear the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to clinics and bonded hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could receive.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00, ruin you at the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the United States ratio is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounais could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is made in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out more than 700 free surgical acts over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he set up a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped close to 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they get into vans after setting the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult land to go to villages that need most help.
Lucky doesn't always follow them.
They have had to push vehicles many times to cross rivers or slopes.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, singing and dancing and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his great smile and overwhelming energy - is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people at each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, pests and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive crutches, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate - a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practice simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, city hall or house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person.
Through the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
This is an awful rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team to remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue to work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returned to the city, tired but proud of the work it had done.
The group, made up of Cambodian doctors and medical students, has carried out 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," the man said.
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical firms around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which funds 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity that they do not have at home.
"We were able to take part in operations to help spill the blood or hand over the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students generally pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," Katie O'Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not near to extinguishing.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a challenge.
Helping others live happy keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him an immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle added.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Smiling people and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two France by Pierre Nora
Perplexes, academics have long peined to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Probably, but stressing his weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitre works of others in his office at Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Of course still, but knowing that such a sacre cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They willingly recognized in him a great awakening, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory," to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages were able to see there a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a strong look and erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the person who passed for not writing had much and well written.
The book here should give him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabond, jubilation put to jump as by foot attached from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the missing objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the broker back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is a concern at the time.
As a result, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, jacobinism obligates, was entrusted to prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre Nora is trampling is all other.
He does not stand as an heir of an eternal francity, he refuses to define.
Concerned with a familiar strangeness, he soaked in a forest of symbols, arrested at each step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented with irritating questions.
Of which this, which is born of the company itself: why, in such a long-standing country in its borders, so previously charmed and well-mastered, are these dramatic calls to unity heard?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to combine the trouble born of discords in French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that is two-fold in national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching to deny it; anxious on the contrary to find the sacrality of it and all the more confusing of unity and indivisibility that it had cut her head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, a nation invincibly binary, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagone, so Pierre Nora's American escape could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have made both a revolution, written a statement of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But American cousinage only makes it better to underline what is our own.
There, men who had left their old regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men with an old indigenous regime, all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when there it has sown the drama and confits it.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are difficult to make, and who have also been killed between them.
This is an institutional constance, and here is a cascade of constitutions, like as many errors to catch up and tests to take over.
France is leaving, France is coming.
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could cross up the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of number two.
At this second central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching to schoolchildren everything that in the old France was obscurably preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only had a while.
This is again in debate, fostered by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise in resolute minorities, absorbed in European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circonspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a prime, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We found out that the chimineau was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The rooster was held in the centre of the centre.
And he who had deposited, here is more than half a century, a subject about the idea of a nation, but had escaped the initiatic exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have done it in the end.
Of course in a less stiff, more shiny and more subtle form.
But let us not, as binding as it is.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university course, this thesis says the inner need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" coming to film a Hizbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has been involved in 2004 in the creation of the "Otages du monde" defence association, which he has been presiding over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained over 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida to the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to take over their life.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde."
From the night of your release, you were on the 8: 00 plateau of "Antenne 2."
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense too.
It is war, and those who drive us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people bring us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means of evacuating to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane staircase, the reunites with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my house, many bikes follow our car that Roussin is driving.
The bikers are shooting each other to make pictures and following me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from going up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to deal with.
But we did the hardest thing.
The same night, I'm at 8: 00, the next day, too, I'm on TV.
Then start some kind of life rehabilitation, very gently, for one or two months that are a little like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and DGSE debriefing?
I was entitled to a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was made at the Val-de-Grâce on the days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me about hostage takers.
It was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you respond today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I'm listening to what it says.
The debate on rançons, in particular.
Some things piss me off, others less.
I try to do the share of things between questions about my past as hostage and my head of the "Otages du monde" association that allows me to put away, and seems much more interesting to deal with.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Especially, I fight with others for recognition of the legal status of hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The use of "political" hostage-taking hostages - most of the time - must be described and hostages must be allowed access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostage-taking hostages before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is done for that.
Why don't we say to hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimate, with common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger grows in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
This is not a trial that points to this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
To date, no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a fake trial is a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
There were clashes in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel reproaches 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and to the benefits that come with," said the Minister in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League against anti-Semitism.
"But some States are refusing to issue such cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located in their territory, "he denounced, blaming those States for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence said that he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.
The fronde of the nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the National Guard of Texas, due to a conflict between the law of Texas and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and the retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard is held this Saturday, November 2 at the Skate Park in Hyères.
Organised by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Enrolment is taken on site on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start in the rocket, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award is presented at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prouesses of young people who, for some, are already attending the high-level competitions, like the young hyerotic prodige Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already conquered his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year, and he does not like anything as much as to show up to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto is hunting journalists who come to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video given to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while acknowledging having a bend for cannabis.
This Thursday, he hunted out of his property several journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need any explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday 31 October that a case of rage had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rage was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological survey was initiated to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 included," says the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the bearer animal, but prior to the onset of symptoms, is very effective," says the press release.
The ministries now call on those who would have been bitten, clawed, scratched, or licked on a mucosal or skin injured by that kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with that kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free of rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," said the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizooties (OIE)."
A case of rage on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been registered in 2008.
"Rage is a fatal disease if not treated in time," says departments, and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama is turning back on his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health care system, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the President in recent days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with appropriate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called "an effervescence in the news" about the resiliations, President Obama incited the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-adapted health care plans for the same price, even for even less expensive than expected.
"You'll get out of it," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5 per cent of the population who are self-employed were forced to change their plan because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed "lamentably."
"I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I can't wait to regain your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who made this sentence, as she believed her micro cut, by speaking to an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday's Assembly session following an exchange of contentious views with Billy Long, republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to support a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now vants to millions of Americans.
Vettel edit a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the runway level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, the quadruple World Champion of Formula 1, tripped a special helmet for the free trial of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday whose drawing was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1.500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday in the trial.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburbs party
Let's not bother.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only directed at the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented on Thursday in the press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighbourhoods.
My proposal is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, a 50-year-old territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitic" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values that I call for in my program are attached to the left, but if people on the right are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I'm not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on Internet- from many themes that are supposed to speak to suburbs and in particular to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political stage. "For the 2014 municipal elections, it may be fair," he recognizes. "
It's a time and money problem.
The suburbs party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my application and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven heads of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday are not all from suburbs," he welcomed.
John Kerry admitted, made without precedent, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated that the US's defensive attitude to its surveillance programs had been scrapped by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by the denouncer Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities was born.
The leaks put the American government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we have the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on September 11."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the edges, but insisted that the rights of everyone had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now in the process of in-depth review of these practices so that no one felt wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that NSA was a force acting for the good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to jump."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, explode them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get acquainted with the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the President of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to Members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made to the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the US Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programmes.
The press reports that NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has hurt relations with some allies in the United States, however the agency director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents disclosed by Snowden that NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and those of 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congress trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "affectionate firmness."
He explained that European Heads of State must be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been implementing for years themselves.
"We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to espionage," said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the rancor generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by United States surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plumbed by Shell's bad results and in the wake of an announcement by the Fed of its continued support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in Phuket for incorrectly claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after having told the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after she had separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the story of all pieces.
She was held in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former player of the Australian Rugby League Peter Tunks, who called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously had a moment of anxiety, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press stated that in the meantime it was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel officer in Phuket, Thailand could also seek to redeem its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.

Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This was the reason for a year ago for a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on how to better integrate students living on horseback between several cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French."
Vision Diversity has been promoting in schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are benchmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are ethnic or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we're creating projects to identify with all of this," says Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is the Quebec culture, the sense of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations that we live, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the University of Montreal will be the Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"This is the real need for different educational strategies," she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
