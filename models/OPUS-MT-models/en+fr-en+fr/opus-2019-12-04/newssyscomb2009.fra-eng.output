Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, early parliamentary elections in Austria have brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the present large coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, is suffering particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumph return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses almost nine percent of the votes, has finished even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the people's party, which has triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July again, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance over the SPÖ.
However, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were expressed about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as soon as Monday, at the extraordinary board of party management.
Such a development would, a priori, facilitate the way towards the outcome of the most likely election, namely the renewal of the major SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free ones (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that BZÖ separa) on a common government, which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently put on this development.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and fell from the third to fifth position among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four-per-cent limit and did not accede to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of refroidir
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cueillette of cockroaches was not resolved, it would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Checo-Indian relations.
The Minister declared it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, when he left the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He said, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, with the case under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years' imprisonment, would be to use a higher court.
He said he could therefore request bail and wait for the trial to be held in court.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, following which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support," said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them by India.
"Above all, we wish to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and prosecution of these Czech researchers a great contempt," he said.
The Minister sketched the question whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the case.
"I have already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech will wrestle the struggle for the sea bottom
It is approaching an e-mural map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
This area is, however, as large as the continent itself, "said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of 30 members of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the Director of the Division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed conceals a world that has not been known so far, rich in natural resources.
There are oil, ores and other mineral resources, but also unknown living organisms, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger bottom than the land is firm
The coastal states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new submarine territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the particular country.
According to the convention, the latter may claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, is considered as a continental shelf the part of the seabed and its basement, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the said exclusive economic yone, "Mikulka explains.
The request of the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly prospections and métrise.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific and technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment only the last three countries mentioned have been successful, "Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarine possessions, has recently experienced global resounding.
New Zealand, too, has won territory - the extent of the seabed, which the Commission allocated to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will benefit in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they are expected, be invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will in turn submit their requests.
They may do so within ten years after ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention."
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean bottom, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity."
There, no State has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let us not forget, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka by exaggerating, specifying that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Chechens in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also in the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the countries of L'Est in the framework of the common organisation "Interoceanmetal."
It obtained in 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of the so-called "pioneer investor."
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is enlivened there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurist.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a realization.
She recalls a small potato, or, with some imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian Government had sought assistance from Germany in the resolution of the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never moved to action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the place of release.
As the spokesperson of the Ministries communicated on Monday night, the German forces were finally not required, as hostage-takers had released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian Government would have accepted Germany's support for its local integration as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," said a spokesperson from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After abduction into the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transbahuted into the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the liberated hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" magazine, the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off on board an Air Force Airbus and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives refuses rescue plan
The first chamber of the US Congress has recently failed the $700 billion heavy financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones was grinding in the abyss.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan in favour of the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that had to curb the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic effort, the partisants had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called for a favourable vote by Members, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones was down by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the State rescue plan could break.
He went back shortly before the vote was over, and then after the announcement of failure, he fell again.
The experts are now planning new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
For the program to come into force, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
The organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite weak short-term prospects, German travel thirst remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to the winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) was entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, growing numbers of reservations already dominate the months of fall.
As a result, sales would have increased to about 11 per cent in comparison to 2007, RVD configured.
The sources of these results are GfK figures, which analyse monthly booking data for 1200 travel agencies and make estimates for the overall market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the USA would be particularly requested, said the RVD.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be destinations particularly sought by the Germans.
In particular, the travel is very much needed, explained the president of the Klaus Laepple DRV.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be here "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individual organized trip."
Consumers can save money, among other things, with reductions in advance reservations or All Inclusivie offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months have also been very well held so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Day
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski in continuous, beer in liter picks and celebrities in tyrolian designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She's blonde, TV animator, and she's wearing a custom-made tyrolian suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is used.
But one thing relies on us: just three minutes at the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap tyrolian suit seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the beer party and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional suit was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse Square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wears a tyrolian suit or leather pants; no one looks blasted or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my tyrolian suit is picking up some weird shots at the banana-chocó stand.
A bavarian reminds me that I would have mistied my apron: "to the left means free, in the virgin middle, to the right casée, to the back widow."
Discretely, I tripper my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she says and laughs.
Others don't get so bad for these flirt subtiles techniques and wear simple beams, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us to their naked backtrain without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a "ooooo" lying.
He's telling me all this after he relieved himself of the chope he had been drinking before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a trash.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild losers."
Others are not lucky to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, aid-workers' ribbons run in the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Nurses are more involved in packs - always by four, they drag their stretch covered with tents in tents.
It works so for most of the visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we go back full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunks under the basement are not visible.
"These are those who can't swallow anything," cries one of the rescue workers in response to my question and then disappears in the middle of it.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because suspected of dangerous driving.
He's been released on bail since then.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was thinking about joining the European Union, the European powers were looking forward to entering its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphore, 20 steps away may be, of Asia, is one of the finest relics of its imperial ambition ruined.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is set on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation tower at each of its angles, like some German provincial mairies.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted stamp, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The train station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as to the land more known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Saudi Arabia and his Arab irregular.
The relative isolation of his area in the surrounding area, caused by the ice borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha's station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is a sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly ruined, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail passage to Anatolie and all the Eastern points, at least symboliquement, to underline the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its area around, caused by the ice borders of the Cold War
Now it's time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turkish Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half hour trip, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and many pastries in which middle managers in suit-cravate - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly, "he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its backcountry.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But now, at some point," I asked if "should Turkey not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between them."
He then stressed an aspect that almost all those with whom I have been able to speak have recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphoritically on track to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha train station, after another night without sleeping, I rethought these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was named "the sick of Europe."
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir had to include the under 21 years, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years - refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in the music.
So sing! "
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if ever dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the music standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be named Knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years, I have seen more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and, a few times, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modestie.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people."
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became in 1950, a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what came from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, and was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51 in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino" Flamenco and Life "because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted attention to me because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino can capture magic moments. "
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his predecessor already had good habitability, this new monovtrès has an even larger interior space.
To this is added some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
A change in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovtrès are many.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it must be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation is placed on the market.
First, it is observed that Honda has refurbished this model within a shorter period than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, almost a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase his sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it is thinking of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary is hoping to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely pallier the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars that is, 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 metres in length - on which the nipponne company hopes to market almost 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and estimated by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Contenant and Japan.
The Insight commercial launch is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 metres (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 metres.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double-bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to back seats.
The doors that give access to the back seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part relative to the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litres gasoline propellers.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6.000 rpm and 114 Nm torque at 4.900 rpm.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz was 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation was 83 horses, now 100 horses.
This 100-horse Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and 128-gram CO2 emissions.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired this time by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating bee theft, avoids accidents.
His name is Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research of Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Trademark Management, the BR23C represents the growth of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created his own personal space in an oval form that looks very much like the Nissan Security Shield.
But the most important are the eyes made up of the bee, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterrupted inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles within a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"As it detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurzing its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The greatest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is completely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Movement Laboratory and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Each second this device must only process information and act according to this data.
He does not need to keep the information or intuitive logic of prior manoeuvres, that's why he can work continuously with only a few dozen memory KB.
This can be surprising, but we are not talking about giga-bytes of memory, or even megabytes. "
This is the first car to develop new technologies for instantaneous collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last more than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid to be hypothecated.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent the Americans from embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's "the hotel of bad credit..." or stories.
The lugubre aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master brings us to think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but undetailed information.
It's more of a teenager game.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his table turn of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a sharp drop in its stock exchange course.
One week after unveiling an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The price withheld is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities that provide a 10% return with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current course.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 5: 00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, Executive Director of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow it to diversify its activities, but it is under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis compels Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," said the Executive Director of MUFG, Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, "we thought that the participation would be fully made up of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year one half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capital will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A panel spokesperson, however, refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had "clearly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
In recent weeks the group has been challenging, who has seen its stock exchange course melting by half while the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt was flowing.
This cost was declining on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch's redemption, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Rebuild the republic around the socialism of the 20th century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, 7% of votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls from polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organization announced a broad victory of "yes," between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed in the night from Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has overwhelmingly triumphed," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in a quiet manner according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, was based on a text in 444 points consolidating the President's "new socialism."
The draft Constitution devotes the power of the State to the economy, by reserving it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Ported by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and put forward a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country 13.9 million people, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the Quito-Washington agreement for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight followers captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 1530 hours on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on helicopters to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb in Cairo, for examination.
They are "healthy," and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, "said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the edge of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this hostage group had been banged from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer reported that 30 special forces personnel, who were sent to two helicopters, had launched the attack in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the responsible who required anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanddos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army had said that it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the kidnappers were located, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which this movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and is taking place in this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the amount of misery that is given to small museums, archives, archaeological searches or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that he negates his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinese castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, in the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 sociétés d'histoire, de patrimoine, d'archives et de généalogie are concerned to search history, preserve with three under private archives and preserve archaeological vestiges.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when proponents and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old forgotten stones and cemeteries.
When, a rostrum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the US credit market crisis, by nationalizing it in part. The three countries support, in the amount of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also using the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition manager.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been growing for more than a year is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions to be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will redeem almost half (49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will no doubt sell part of its holdings, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzy fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be let go to bankruptcy.
Only Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's leaders, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the non-Atlantic uncertainty, related to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the source of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as head of the bank as new Director General.
The financial agency was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also repurchased leasing companies.
A fox in the poulailler
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information on prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's about entrusting his huller to a fox "- said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug requirements, in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and insured capital in the event of damage, the health status of the client present, and if they believe that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they were aware of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it easily supplies with pharmacies, data about the person's drug purchases over the past eighteen months. From this, the program itself determines what disease the person suffers from and what its health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts it in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no more to do to the insurer except the paperwork. However, small problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures may be used against migraine or heat puffings, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others, no.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and must request permission from the patient before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are being forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past misconduct.
In recent years, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with drug use data, and in this way they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the control circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he has developed even further his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, and ultimately, hens depend on the goodness of the fox.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are twice multiplying their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation on atomic energy will be discussed in particular.
The European Union recognizes that India is a large emerging democratic power to which a wider right to speak in international affairs should be given, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
In fact, they did not take too much care of this issue yesterday at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Head of Diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would increase trade by two, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among EU partners.
The Summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation had been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject had been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need for a global market at the climate conference next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and have supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is visiting the French capital today, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth €20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international appointment in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403miles of titles in exhibition, and Turkey as a guest of honour.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with an Italian Point - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the Buchmesse butterfly 5.0: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign copyright is gradually decreasing from the total Italian production, and in particular from that for adults and children.
We found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a tray at 3000 metres above sea level, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County sheriff John Anderson evicted the remaining doubts: "The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one Steve Fosset was travelling on the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered to be dead.
The United States Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was tracked, a team of investigators sent to the site, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset dispatched from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal effects were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents called Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he had made the world round by plane and without a stopover.
Of all these records, also that of having stolen at 15.445 metres high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you're not waiting for.
A 4x4 out of common of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with large surfaces and net angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the last born of the "compact" off road of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
The communication will be accompanied by the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from October 17.
Thus the advertising beating that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication modality, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a brand car.
A maxi display project, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of the Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in tridimensional format.
In fact, we will feel that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recompose into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to raise the interest of future purchasers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, so far, had never created big problems.
Neither had it ever been with the fake tifosi.
Group extraction is on the right.
The proponents are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in reality) of Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricoloured flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by the English shutter.
In Bulgaria, they found a shutter of real Nazists, that of the Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been prohibited from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, had no right to the ticket, and could not travel.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders may purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids to attend Italian stadiums, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot on the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others may be added to the one hundred and fifty first.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire, and not legitimize this behaving," Viminal supports.
So, "keep your eyes well open especially in view of the National Team game of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce chorus, and the arm tense during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (really not pleasant) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds observer number 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
To date, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's talk about whistles to Mameli's hymn: those are not crimes too, but if you allow me, they are not polite... "
