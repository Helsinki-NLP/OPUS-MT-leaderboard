Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth American President of History to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be given to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the King of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will have its summum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the award in the Committee's own forum.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the award was awarded.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a President who is leading a war in two countries at this time.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to underline.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of 10 million Swedish kroons (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable works, but he has not yet made a concrete decision on which.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet, including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling not to deserve it fully.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the time of the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act."
A nature defender accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police charged the president of the Association of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Litoměřice police.
The President of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bennes are not at the fragrance in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their drink packages, while in the villages of Moravia du Sud you fall on sorting bennes at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take several minutes before you find the appropriate bins.
I don't mean we wouldn't waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the city's municipal councillors, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of many of the bins dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is the Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but it seems to me quite little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sincerity either.
So in the end, many of my friends don't sort their waste.
By lazy.
It makes them a sneak to get to the junkies.
I'm not surprised about that.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I haven't seen any Kounicova Street color junk.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was over it.
It's after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to be the best representative of the city, right?
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aesthetics are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league of hockey that makes the city ashamed all over the country, instead of buying some extra bins and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to have been able to confuse my impression with official statistics after dragging a while on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has taken off retreats and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or even public servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social-democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It is only to put the problems back to later, to undermine the ground," said Janota.
It is important to know that on the money borrowed the interest payable is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state has no real choice to know where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in the funds, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow more and more quickly and with it, interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of electors.
These are mainly sections already decided and started, of which it is not possible to change projects to possibly reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adroitement - it will draw from the ČEZ dividends (electric power supplier and distributor), which the State has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottom-up chip.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to complete pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the reform of pensions that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7% of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department side or, at the worst, reach the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of $100 million in the two-billion State Fund project, which will allow for online monitoring of the expenditure of each administration.
The first step will start in January.
If the Finance Minister did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to move from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just a button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
He will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not a matter of fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously operated the listed Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new mobile phone technologies is growing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to 2012 devices.
The scarcity of snow in the mountains traps the hotels
The deserted tracks are not only a problem for slopes operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to uncover free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users travel through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately if there will be snow or sludge at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info. information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotels currently offer only one-week stays for New Year's.
I think they're going to try again for a moment to place them, but they will also give up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease, "Jandura estimated.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas for the moment, but it is not completely sold.
We still have half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few last-minute cheaper Christmas stays, "said Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are just as good, the remaining winter stays are selling medium.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete, "Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as well as Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Polish and February is also sold well, "says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also 80% complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in Jánské Lázně's most recent hotel.
This year we have been delightfully surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at this time.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest for the stays in the Krkonoše will grow still certainly has indicated the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Krkonoše hotels must not, however, hope for more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there are precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, time should be warm, says Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Rehearsal is mother of wisdom
He even became comic, the effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, replicated his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered very simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so ardemment expected, it turned out that he had recopiated it with carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq," he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful so that the current newspapers did not speak about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, which said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than could be hoped.
Barack Obama hopes in Afghanistan, the miracle will reproduce
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Commander of Operation Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticences of the White House despite the subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The President hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he at least squandered the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had out of 10,000 originally.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-rise will bring the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricide wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is quite the opposite - no one can count on it and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change the day-to-day leadership according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only the powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state of action," which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes it perplexed by his volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be convinced that the small soldiers sent to the tumult of war for their "prompt return to home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the enhanced sanctions do not affect the Iranian people, the Americans will face the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be addressed, for example, as Obama says, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
Each such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to put it on a new strategy, in case it is found to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash bonuses
The high-ranking executive employees of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link retributions with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning that needs to be taken, "said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong banking premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
The United Kingdom announced on Wednesday that it was planning to allocate a single fee of fifty percent of bankers' bonus in excess of £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have obtained Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
It is five women, a record number, who today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature from the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their chromosome research.
The Chemistry Award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the Nobel Medal degree, and the certificate of acquisition of the financial award.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kroons in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been given this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To discharge his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the State budget for next year as it was voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps Janota's position at the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
In his view, the deficit is too large, which further increases the financial crisis.
The meeting was informed by the presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be signed by Klaus, it is a deficit of DKK 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies on Wednesday validated the proposals from the left regarding money transfers and increased public servants' rewards, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government reproached the proposals of the social democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, there was a violent disagreement between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement which questioned the future of Fischer's firm, which had been formed by agreement between ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
The criticism states that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer Government and which it believes must curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but that there is nothing to do with it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long overlooked the "serious problem" of the "irrefrinable impairment" of public finances.
Now, in his view, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly not working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts."
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is scary and will exceed 200 billion kroons.
On Wednesday already, ČSSD has described the ratification of the State budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africa states that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu's new film will expose to the world many things about the country, its fighting and its victories.
History is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor rewarded to the Oscars, embodies the life film of Nelson Mandela, an infatigable fight against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was a 90-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally."
The seventy-twelve-year-old actor who was rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama located in the middle of boxing, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slave-making himself a slave, a president of the fictitious USA, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African State man was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
The South African team will eventually move forward in the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to a large screen.
I had no other purpose if not to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge for me was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get back from your energy, she's moving and I feel like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I look much bigger in the film."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive opinions and we are even talking about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarised his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-done film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent positive appreciations.
The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only acknowledged yesterday having tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile that was originally to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly away, or she damaged herself in the middle of a flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" like "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't steal but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage again on the equipment.
It was clearly the third floor engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired from a moving and immersed boat.
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably by a defective "Bulava."
On the other hand, the Norwegian people have not doubted for a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot talk about a failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage only touched the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went unharmed, the Department of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore empties the generals of optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even take ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will meet again in a professional game at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympic Champion and Holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a hand-in-need hand to his team of CSKA Moscow and will make his entry probablyalready in the Friday game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at 40 years in 1998, is for the time being the President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is training regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, cited by the AP agency.
It has not been specified if the legendary hockey player's comeback will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus became the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and got 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champions, and triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected hommages in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled every overtime.
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime hours.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai factory confirmed that.
Management, however, wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company has offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroons to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
He will also be awarded a post-eriori for the day worked on November 28.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way in which it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their year-end feasts aindicated Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of both trade unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the car plant were forced to work almost two hours per day in addition to their eight hours.
Trade unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the car plant management and the trade unions is to take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchatrès said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when almost 400 employees spontaneously entered the strike because of continuous overtime.
They also protested against the bad conditions of pay and so-called strangling.
Management defended that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements for car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who had ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of Krowen 5,000 (about €209) for them.
The Hyundai Nošovice car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It made about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow down the proliferation of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed drug immunity.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top of the fact that the combination does not act so intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg, opens the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to the virus's proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple-wall cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A trash-resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explain the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to consider further in order to develop effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína řezáčová, Director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Science.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS takes care of Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget as "frightening" for the following year, and according to him, Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should question its existence.
The Prime Minister has described the ODS as a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
The spokesperson for ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly not working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the House of Deputies who is concerned with the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of ODS and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposite.
The House of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, with the proposals for amendments of Kroner 12 billion included by the left.
The House has increased money for public servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's grievance over the proposals of social democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of DKK 163 billion.
ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad alternative than an interim budget.
Disappointment and useless
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of useless, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his duties if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after his passage to government:
He indicated at the same time that he was wondering if he would stay in his office.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason for that.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who have imposed changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by ODS did nothing detrimental, Topolánek pointed out in a text release from the United States.
He recalled that the Deputy Ministers of some departments called for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
However, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS was retracted.
Nečas pointed out at the same time that ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to be voted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he reacted to the question whether ODS had not been reproached by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have failed.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of everything positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit certain less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, strengthen some others.
The total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of the new two-per-cent hours compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more links to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino rame.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can rejoice at an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
One of the greatest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main train station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional kroons.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in a total of four billion kroons to pay the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase in the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška reduced-price Internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška will recently depend on the journey, while until then it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels always hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have now abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed about it, but that was the source of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage took place in Agusan del Sur province.
It was reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police leak.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November in connection with the elections of the Governor's administration there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested as a result of suspicion of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywoodian film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the United States in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him, was back in the role of the world-known fighter against apartheid.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the returns of the critics and of the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand in full preparation for the football world Cup, and on the other because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the ruling black majority.
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where "pavanent" Hollywoodian stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by resuming his own terms.
I've dreamed of this long-term role and I've been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able - as they say - to recover from his energy, he said at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual has added.
Porter le maillot de la équipe nationale de rugby
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is freely translated into the title. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicted the South African human rights defender during his term as President.
Morgan Freeman therefore tried during the film to bring together two racial groups of a long divided population and along with Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered clothed of the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the world Cup, which South Africa had won at that time.
To have been shown on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been lonely ovationated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let us hope that the football championship will succeed in unite people again into one nation, "said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only" black "of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
However, the South African whites are sceptical as recently entrusted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship began on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of kroons to flames in the Louny region
A fire burnt in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution centre near the commune of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesperson for the Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally expected to let the processor consume, but they reconsidered their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the processor.
No one was injured and according to the spokesperson of Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission package.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of kroons, the exact figure can be known once the fire is off.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed processor will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electrical power supplies were not interrupted, says ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohema Soña Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in Czech territory of transmission systems and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renoves and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electric energy from transport systems to distribution systems and lines of a length of 4339 km.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, is going to file a complaint today for defamation against three social democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc Martin Tesařík region.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minut de Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and say that we are doing fine buckets, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for the calomnies on the Student Agency, said Jančura to the Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that there was evidence that no region had carried out in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is the continuation of his media show that serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million kroons in an ad that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and plan to take it back after New Year.
He said that the campaign will focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of about Kroner 150 billion, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats to Jančura by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He was a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who this is, but I won't say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as of January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voice is already rising, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
New vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay for the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year already a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet the parents paid 1600 kroons or more for one dose.
The vaccination of the younger requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 kroons on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
To date, the State has spent about KK 500,000 a year on all child vaccination.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package."
Pneumococcus are the cause of medium ear flammations, but also serious infections such as meningian flammations and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age are caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced repaid vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose this at least.
I think it is a direction that must now be followed has said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We do not consider it for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršetrès.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Pediatrician Specialized Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on volontariata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease in vaccine renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that from next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Physicians will have to buy their products themselves
This is, however, related to the concerns of the pediatricians who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance, as doctors receive them in the same way as other government-provided vaccine products.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct amounts from health insurance."
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest almost 40,000 kroons per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
The son of Frank Frazetta, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while he was loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) agency.
AP cited a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such permission, said the agency.
The Labour is defending the increase in the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and the reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism by the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction in the deficit by postponing its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew his attention to lightning by addressing low and average wages.
Its main proposals include an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The anger of social insurance
The unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible for and warned that "problems" were coming forward.
The decrease in social insurance - which will make it possible to get about GBP 3 billion a year - has put the world of business angry, because he believes it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will fall more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate profit tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Reductions of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person who wins GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and one person who wins GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while one person who wins GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 was "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and noted that a decrease in expenditures was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important and will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would restart at the end of the year.
However, the Labour's economic growth forecasts - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missing opportunity" '
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" making difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They did not present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would result in a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said that the money collected through increased taxes and lower expenditures would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that plans were "built on wind."
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said that the advertising schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned below - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people most need it and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Wrong budget"
Although Ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would only start to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscale Studies) stated that the figures of the Chancellor in future involve substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"Pain is actually only postponed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important ads will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI is investigating "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters, suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid at a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the American state of Virginia last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was also looking for information about these persons.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what charges are against them and under what conditions they are held, "said the spokesperson, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it is actually the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comments on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency, but she said that the United States must "work more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to deracinate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been removed from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential elections in June campaign.
One man cited in the report said that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes and another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to the greatest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of 'Working with Facebook networks' and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was cited.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that protesters held after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these organizations were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a competitive track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders in competition for cash prices.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park runway, a small tremplin preceded a 100 m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view of the top of the track was beautiful but rather intimidating.
It's a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city scintillating down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talents, "he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned in the melting.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why French don't like scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and worries the country for about 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
Good anthropologist, he does not only want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France this queM. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He can listen very well to and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political drama that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts in a Sunni purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today is a small part of Europe's Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrow key values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were demonstrating their experience by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then 14-year-old brave who had only to fight the tip of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young hurricanes, captured as they swim alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and cirques.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are always a millionth of the surface needed for an adult in liberte. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters to species survival.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killers continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assaults to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters northernmost of these two nations of hunting that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scary summary of Arctic science and a captivating overview of what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheres nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of changes.
It's not because of trying.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th century, the pioneering trips of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting of the ice pallet.
The submarines of the Cold War then mapped the changes in the subsurface.
The satellite monitors and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contempts the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the pumpkin water nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn."
Des Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson first class made a seven-hour bus trip to place a simple crown on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we are at risk of being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns on the tombs of the veterans in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemoration in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 kroons on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave over $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career member.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emmitoufled in several layers of hot clothes, volunteers walked between the lawn and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new tombs, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children played and the couples stood by hand, bearing the fresh pine crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 kroons to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read loudly the names engraved in the stone while others bent to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wetland for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many tears mothers on his son's grave.
She left Zanesfield in Ohio and had taken eight hours to come to the grave of Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free of... my son paid for that, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has arrested an American national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous."
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of an arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an increasingly large blogger community led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husband and she are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but it has always been denied permission.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist Brothers' Government in Cuba and the Obama Administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee's average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for textos or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings such as universities.
Cubans who often want to connect must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a great mistake.
One activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often caused a negative reaction to the United States, as both countries began to start a better dialogue.
Pakistan authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who shattered the Internet in search of young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the prohibited mountains in the north-east, becoming a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed themselves on the condition of maintaining anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permission to get entry into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists in the determination of those who trust them.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have had a priority to infiltrate men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for climate
Dozens of thousands of Protestants have walked in the streets here, Saturday, asking for more action on the climate by negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center palace.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25 000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city.
On this day, when little has happened during United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists have walked through the city, deploying signs in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to his mother's home country, Peru, has opened her eyes on the devastating problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to make the word and to appeal to leaders around the world to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people because they had a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people because they had a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passage that asked to keep anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists who were wearing black masks and clothes, lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English "In fact, that's something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He observed that the march may seem to be harmful or useful according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disrupting negotiations or that they are detrimental to the freedom of others."
The results of the tests show tenacious differences between breeds
Last week's federal report on mathematics results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools
Although the District remains far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is apparent from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between Afro-American and white results, both locally and nationally.
Average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in WashingtonD.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their Afro-American comrades have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap in fact increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase of the group director of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) were being propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This means that we have raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in education in the District.
I do not jump any joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic-related), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is scary is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting school students from the end classes of the elementary cycle and early college who did not integrate the basis of reading earlier in their school course and who are quite late in comparison with their comrades.
Every day, the mathematics program for Kindergarten (Kindergarten) to Grade 6 (6th) classes focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these lower-than-class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP pose the question whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who studies the results of the city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest Washington districts.
Thus, this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendent of Schools, she is trying to use the middle class of white and black.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they originate, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap extended the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "starting point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and clines a moment of eyes in view of white columns, brick facades and green lawn.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, born in Silver Spring and living in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
As well, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new impressed student than enthusiastic.
Great Here I am going to study! Excluded Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide was heading them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? She said she was thinking, when she was told the low ratio of law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Spanish immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second-generation hispanic" in five continues his high school -- a significant success if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without having completed the high school.
Their success is important, says researchers, they open the way for next generations who will play an important role in the country's labour force.
Researchers who study battleships say they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children in low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with over 60 per cent coming to university, according to the United States Ministry of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in rehabilitating Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by dozens of years of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with a participation in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started Friday.
The only one who had put an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, were Asian and European companies that opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information site on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability while US military troops withdrew, have freed US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, said analysts.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, are left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the state, has enchanted more on contracts than other companies and has left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit auctions made tenders which were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, declared US counter-espionage authorities on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, within the Anarchic Tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading to the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's civil secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority stated that local suspicious activists rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained "completely shredded bodies."
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize complots around the world, said one of the authorities that wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of the al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaeda's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but this does not diminish its threat to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of activists in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has been down since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a web site moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also killing suspicious informants, says the site.
United Nations Special Envoy to Kabul withdrew
UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate with allegations of extensive corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States schedule for withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, "said Eide in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a substitute.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives state that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a Swiss-Italian citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that Galbraith's charges -- which were thanked -- "have been detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism with regard to international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted on United Nations officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
Secretary for Defence Robert M. Gates said Friday that the great world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a parland of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has devastated the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a denouement. ¨
One of the things that weigh me most, is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is well the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishment" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer enormously "from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately necessary for a medical research reactor.
The administration has led to such an agreement, a means of developing confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from the attempts to agree - in part, the experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
I frankly believe that the raiding of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact agreed in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major global Powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish to counter the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are still tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of American troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of the Kurds about the outstanding withdrawal. The US authorities cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not give up on you. "
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda poster, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave."
They learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have started to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, called "small emperors," a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 years and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, which is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not so rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
Redigited in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women from a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters inciting families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and to slide prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although those responsible in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in the demand for couples wishing a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western people misconsider that the single child policy is a rights problem, said Yang, a construction engineer whose woman is pregnant for seven months of the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company said so more cruly.
For middle-class couples who lower birth rates, he said, we must be selfish for success.
People 20 or 30 years old grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child needs a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
"Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living," he said.
We don't want to make too much sacrifice.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations, which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations, has come back under the fire of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations spilling most of the burden, in the coming time.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with over 100 leaders from around the world coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to support global warming in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the top limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "the full image."
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Climate Negotiation Representative, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder towards China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions by major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after Chinese Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US principal negotiator either lacked "common sense," or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major global powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States fighting their respective obligations while the poorest nations insist that the two dozens of most influential countries are unaware of the scientific imperatives to act more couragously.
Ricardo Ulate, a representative of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to find out who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on them to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Insular States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the European Commission's Climate Unit, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the full political process," in part by what they are now unified and that they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Discussions became an urgent issue, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems pending before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and information conferences in order to be able to make claims that will be considered in the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Palace every day -- guitar activists present night shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
Intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the great, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Conservation International's global policy.
HVCs are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km / h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 513, Monday morning, a whistle will lose the night to report the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed subway train in the country will reach 225 km / h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin subway train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and link the major conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburbs, the length of business travel will be much less long, and the passage of the aircraft and the car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties are members of this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and environmental concerns are likely to curb British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line between London and West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network that goes north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in an Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When it is over, travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be required.
As space constraints are given, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts report that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to run out of high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, as a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75.000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his house in his constituency.
The party leader who was demolished by David Cameron to complain that the members of Parliament were "maintained," increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension at his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to have the taxpayer pay the additional interest, which amounts to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control over members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland - Melton district.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda at home, describing it in his plans as an orangeray.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee concerning his prior borrowing provisions.
The Committee incriminated him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the loan of GBP 271,406 from his London property to his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75.000 loan.
The variable standard interest rate RBS has increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the Ghost Office in September, after an undercover journalist said he was filmed saying that members of Parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" of the... e "
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked for more, but I didn't. "
The member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former position as a oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that "it could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with deflection or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It could not be more net or simpler. "
Faithful, come and see the calendar of the Avent of Brighton.
The Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5: 30 p.m. to 6: 30 p.m. each day, with free pats and hot wine.
Noel's songs so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël," for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We hope that religion will be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Avent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent this through spirituality. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Dozens of thousands of people have manifested on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, throughout the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred interpellations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, have parade in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to conclude by Friday an agreement that can enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization of climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the cortège, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with pavement and hammer beams, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened without menagement.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to it of "Blocs Blacks" members, these ultra-violent groupuscules that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were "undistinguished," stressing that about 100 of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold. "
Parliament party, the cortège, a rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candle wake with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrators had come by car and by train from large cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate."
Today we are going down the streets to ask for reparation of the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: we have time, "said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that drain in Africa, rivers where we can walk as we had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had led to the dispatch of events.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, parade in red, sailing bandanas vanting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters have also held meetings to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered together.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce."
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first ballot after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five successful candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Soukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with somptuous landscapes, by the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch along with the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located around this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, provided a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the voting process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in allusion to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For his part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, asserts that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: world events, incidents in Copenhagen
Dozens of thousands of people walked around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the live, interpellated almost 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, parade in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December the delegates from 193 countries, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament party, the cortège, generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the expected speakers, before a candle wake with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the departure of the cortège, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened unmanageably, throwing several of them down.
The police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of "Blocs Blacks," these ultra-violent groupuscules which had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interrogation of about 20 people, according to the police.
We have to look at the extremist groupuscules, had warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the law enforcement helicopters were turning in the sky.
The majority of demonstrators, who came by car and train from large cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate."
Today we are going down the streets to ask for reparation of the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP to come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had led to the dispatch of events.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, have manifested, clothed with red and bore bandanas vanting solar energy in front of the town hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred protesters have also held meetings to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered together.
The history-geo is reinforced from the reform of general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminals.
From now on, first-time students will have all four hours per week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "we need to get out of hypocrisy" because he says "S is no longer a scientific sector" but "basically, it concentrates the best students."
The ES and L sectors cannot remain subsectors of S, he continued, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals either blinding themselves from the absence of history-geography in terminals in technological lycées."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey in L'Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) disagreed with the government's project to remove compulsory education from history-geography in terminals S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was "not a question" of deleting the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their view sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, "said the Minister.
They will also take internships in situation during the M2 year and then be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add all of the courses offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in National Education."
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school map "by 2012."
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Normal Superior School of the rue d'Ulm on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a 15-minute series of expert interventions each, filmed and open to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and makes them want to know more, explained in the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day that draws its name from that given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 stakeholders were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but using graphics, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he said, hoping that listeners will accept that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an extremely serious scientific issue."
The videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison workers' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to require the payment by year-end parties of premiums and overtime whose payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-prison (2nd Union of Supervisors) has asked personnel who will not be in service to manifest Tuesday morning in front of the penitentiaries and "block them," to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-Prison (3rd Union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization," judging "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back dissatisfaction and anger."
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the rest will be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors ensuring that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, "said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the penitentiary administration to set up a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation arising from a misassessment of the number of overtime does not occur in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be lean, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous functions and objectives premiums, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back."
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille, by announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations."
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than unfortunate to try to get on with staff deniers, "said the Bordeaux GTC-Prison.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less than others.
But in any case the account is not there, said the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "colder things" than the ones he receives.
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with a family at the White House, entrusted to the "papess" of the small Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I give things more cool than those I receive."
As part of a special show to be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the four-legged little companion of the family will be from the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama made a mistake against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Certainly not, I offered you sympas gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, did he have to confess before replying humor by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace with his finger: "Who offered you this?"
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fervent support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered to him at Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only a lot later in my life that I realized that it was him who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, "said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors had found "lesions resulting from the operation" of the discale hernia in Paris on 26 November, said in Paris his press service, stating that these lesions had "required a restorative operation."
The singer's press service, however, sought to reassure itself that the situation was "under control," while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Interrogated by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this discale hernia.
The intervention, which had been scheduled for several days, had been carried out by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic community.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured himself not to be "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a battant."
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a bullshit because doing 12 hours of plane after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had been reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigated."
Mr. Camus had also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, at the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed having been operated with "small colon cancer," then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66," presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is extensively commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings had to even deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the World-2009 in a large basin, took an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly affectionates, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in a small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are last allowed saw only three records of the world beaten while we were waiting for a deferment.
One has been improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swim and the other two by Russia in Gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swim relay.
A regret for Bousquet, who was staring on the record of the world of the 50 m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two reins of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old French who imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet outdated the Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in the occurence, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
Originally 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of combinations did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his brand over 400 m free swimming (3: 32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3: 34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danois Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
I didn't give myself a lot about this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophage panel belonging to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophage panel, which belonged in particular to French writer Emile Zola, was awarded Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, announced art merchant Sotheby's.
This front panel of two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four dionymous scenes in a sophisticated architectural décor, surrounded by satyres and bacchantes, is a rare room, there are only four or five in the world," had explained to AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby '.
He was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most enchanted so far, has told the AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble dates back a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his tub in his particular Paris hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, Minister under the IIth Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It was still a shade area of about 50 years.
In search of the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and of the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart."
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the disappointed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exception by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived on Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft went back to its place of origin, according to a source of the Directorate General for Migration.
The putschist government has wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and to apply for political asylum abroad to grant him an outlet.
But the disappointed president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of State in office invited.
The putschist government "had a new failure in wanting me to give up (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr Zelaya on the Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the torn president, refugee at the Brazil Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has made us an application for a luggage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, had said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the Honduran radio HRN.
I don't ask any country for asylum, "said Manuel Zelaya in an interview at the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as President of the people of Honduras, he said.
Mr. Zelaya's rumors of departure had mobilized Wednesday the supporters of the disappointed President, who came together around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their seats.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he had come back by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to blame for the crime of "high treason" including accusing him of justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote recognized by the United States but challenged by countries in Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, the US trade balance generates optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing the recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.

For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell in October from 7.6 per cent in September to $32.9 billion.

On the other hand, new unemployment enrollment in the United States increased against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.

Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters conspute to "White Dames"
A few hundred Cuban supporters of power on Thursday consputed wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another event for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Around 40 "White Dames," married or close to political prisoners, were held in the middle of the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government when they were walking to the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a AFP journalist found.
At the bottom of the Yankees!, "mercenaries!," "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!," "Vive Fidel and Raul!" scandoned, the fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came to "ensure their protection."
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Dames" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also about to manifest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were, they, arrested by police officers in civilian, found an AFP journalist.
The police force brought into civilian vehicles dissidents who were consputed by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
The 2005 Sakharov Prize winner of the European Parliament, the "White Dames" had organized an unauthorized walk to "ask for the release of all political prisoners," 200 according to the dissidence, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda served a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under locks.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarissim, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forcee kills an octogenar with a knife and makes five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife gunman killed an octogenar and injured five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor was reportedly beaten with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenar, in or in front of a pharmacy from 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Deeply injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a head of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about 30 years old, interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeny sucked.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a discomfort and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passagers, apparently at random: a trentenary and a quadragenary, the latter grip.
The scenario was still confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives he was wearing in a cross behind his back, explained an on-site leader of the Alliance Union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passagers, including young people, according to AFP testimonies, tried to control the force.
I saw a guy about 30 years with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was a cozy guy, reported Alberto, a server from a close bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their head, tried to attack the armed man and were injured by punching, according to police sources.
The facts have occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passengers came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put it in a security position, and I saw a very important abdomen wound, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later arrived a second person of about 30 years, injured with a knife.
It was the national police that arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has referred the investigation to the Department of Judicial Police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forensics were hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being held in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of surexcitation" like "all the forces of this species whose forces deplete under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a morals case over 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist," denounced to three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- had been discussing, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious procedural misconduct.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel requested that a trial be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argumentary already developed at first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never been back to the United States since.
The Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to come to the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to run away?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor from the court, while despising his authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "there are other alternatives to leak."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who asked for the abandonment of the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every rebound in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was placed in his cottage in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street finishes without direction, freed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange finished without direction on Friday, in a market rooted between better than expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while Nasdaq, with a technological dominant, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, "said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the strength of economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence increased significantly in December, to 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been freed by a further increase in the dollar, at the highest for two months in the face of the euro, which "pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury Bond increased to 3,540%, compared with 3,482% on Wednesday night, and the performance of the 30-year Treasury Bond increased to 4,497%, compared to 4,492% on Wednesday night.
The election of Miss Monde again in South Africa
After a month of journey across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross Saturday the last straight line to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real turbillon.
To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town, it was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and had so many experiences!, except Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 1700 (1500 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa has been marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of scenery in this country."
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional suit and of course in a swimsuit.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss Monde Steve Douglas Committee.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equate, "said Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptional, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shaken their hand.
Not common for a Head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the drawing of lots in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup of football, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I will certainly come back for the World-2010, "said Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had been going to his father's bed for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday at his exit from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he was going "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discale hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a discale hernia in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is schooled, to attend a school show, found an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus considered that Johnny Hallyday was "gone far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that had amazed me, since I myself had two discale hernies, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "gone without drain, without nothing," after his parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic community.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfureux reputation, sentenced several times by the court, in cases of medical responsibility, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scrupules" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, which is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal."
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been increasing since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of OPA of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the sigle of the former Giscardian party, by putting him in no longer to use it on any basis, subject to judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF sigle, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the CN National Council.
To support his approach, he received support from Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to CN), who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dissented, has come out of his silence to launch a stand-alone to the Minister and the Member of Parliament, summing them to no longer use the sigle and to transmit to them the property of the mark, subject to judicial prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to + resume + the UDF sigle, writes the association in a mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought it was good to follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New centre +, the slogan + UDF of today +, also see the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office which replaces the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from any support as well as from (sound) website."
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to pass on the property of the mark to his legitimate successors."
If you did not, the courts would be brought before them to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories are warned.
In their mail, they stated that the UDF "was a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
In their view, therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 voted its accession to MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, "when he filed the mark," he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but a member of the UMP.
He profited scandalously and fraudulently from the abscence of deposit of the UDF acronym to do it on his behalf.
"It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for weakness abuse
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenar for the spoliation of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will well be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear up while holding the dreams of the empire of the cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise from Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to report before March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll do it.
I'll talk to her about it, said at the end of the hearing the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has been in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a touch-to-all photographer and artist, who she accuses of having profited for years of her mother's weakness to get a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend.
While the court was to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers's action, counsel 'pleadings sometimes turned to the great family release on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers's husband.
In the 2003 mail, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage. "
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a judge of the tutels has in recent days refused to grant her application to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees, points out the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to have collaborators accede to "values" determined from above as it was before, to impose on consumers products thought by plant technicians.
By putting the client at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies back there... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preferences factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees may lead to mortiferous demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
The EI "requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision from all stakeholders"; it requires a commitment from employees that authoritarian management revenues completely contrarize.
This is why we call for a management revolution that would be to put the employees at the centre of the company's concerns as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Will internal opinion surveys - such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his employees - encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally happens, after many detours, to do priority... what she has always done.!
- Then, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of the lung - grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
Issus of the major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory, recently reactivated by the United States' neurosciences, and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr supports the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, requires a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment for the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this design of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and "place" their human resources management. "
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "just war" is worth praise to Obama on the right
The American right welcomed Friday the speech delivered in Oslo the day before by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against United States enemies.
The Conservatives, who had embraced the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, in the daily USA Today, adding that she itself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her just published memoranda.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop those terrorists all over there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some occasions, I found this historic speech, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show" The Takeaway. "
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to see "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not repay a peace prize if the use of force did not exist. "
For Michael Gerson, former feather by George W. Bush reconverted chronicle at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to being "a citizen of the world" like "he always does," he spoke like an American president, "reminding Europeans" that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush era falcon, the former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, bull and inspiration-free" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the President, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we embrace war into the concept of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained commendable to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," has flattered the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama "delivered the speech it needed," said the New York Times, judging it "both dark and building."
Routiers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiating sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signature session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing the text of agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had clashed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting started at 11: 00 so that everyone agreed and at 6: 00 the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to companies" and "it was to be feared that he would come to disrupt the late-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and by 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "there is a rise from €8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going from far away, "said Patrice Clos (FO).
We are going to order our activists that there are no blockages, no blockades of refuelling centres.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement," even though it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages in view of international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "an historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "an acceptable compromise."
The Agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of a general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer costs" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amending finance law, voted on the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies that are members of this organization, and second to the whole profession, if the Minister of Labour is extended.
It will be "as soon as possible," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market," because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to confuse the turkey eaters of the next awakening, deplored the Unostra.
For the Bear, the agreement may "dig the tomb of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: disruption this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbance on the RER A, France's largest urban public transit line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 20am, due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette galleries, which are waiting for 200,000 customers every day, have been pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores."
The RER A crosses from the west to the east of the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two was in peak hours, and almost no hollow hours rame, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Franciliens having organized themselves.
In the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of college and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that he was "up 30 hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time."
Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said SNCF, which had provided a framework of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station to reach the subway.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, considered "meagre" by the trade unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due bonus, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, blamed the CGT, stressing that management "was not done to solve a problem while in the roads and the SNCF it is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said RATP.
This also made the trade unions know that the company "laughed at weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that management, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of ease" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents have given notice.
The unions demand a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, including 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in part two of their careers, pay between EUR 2,200 and EUR 2,700 gross as well as EUR 600 to EUR 650 in bonuses, for hourly hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court held on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the Government's task, which has just given hands to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Mr. Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including his President Ahmet Türk and Member of Parliament Aysel Tugluk, are banished from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to which Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk were entitled and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabelled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window for PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that it does not have "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes as the government has just given hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to delay Kurds' support for the PKK and to end the conflict.
DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution could lead to increased tensions in the anatolien southeast, where many protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city of southeast, which is populated by the majority of Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear-mogen grenades and used water guns, while protesters were throwing molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the Justice would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most murderous in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sabling service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to control them well.
And according to the meterologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES is following a very well-developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he started snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures descended below zero, large sablage vehicles travel 20 main routes (known as A routes).
This includes large-traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße are also included.
The FES officers start their service at 3: 00 in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a well-adjoining road base in 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3: 00 in the morning "so that roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migration begins."
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7: 30 in the morning.
This is a problem, says the head of the road clearing and sabling service "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass."
Then, if it no longer sneaks, we take care of access roads and dessert roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary lanes and the side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this still causes a few complaints.
At five in the morning, the FES pedestre team started working to prioritize hazardous areas and crossings.
As for cycling trails, FES services are generally not able to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt which was responsible for monitoring the state of the bridges between 10: 00 and 4: 30 p.m.
As the ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature descends below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service as needed.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 metres long for 1.50m high, its later members were powerful, its elongated skull was equipped with acarized and plumbed teeth, its short arms ended with saucy claws and had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time made part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangee and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa once again illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
He informs us about the relationship, distribution and characteristics of the parent.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook searches with other paleontologists, on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico
Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the search team tells that sometimes they found a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that part of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginning of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him as Tawa according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but it makes it possible to confirm certain theories about the beginning of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, what time the Saurians divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) that include tyrannosaure and the later-appeared velociraptor, from which the birds, the sauropods, quadrupheds in the long neck, and those related to them and the ornithisdog herbivores are part of such species as triceratops and stegosaure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae, vertebrae was also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of the huge sauropodes also had aerial bags and a light ossature, one can think that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Sauriens had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution divided from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging land that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologists team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there were at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn said there is an even older species, silesaure, who lived in current Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually none on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary age while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptiles branch, remains today a mystery.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus promoting the development of many new species while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success is, however, not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaur survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better suited, so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite 'development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then was in the shadow: they were mammals.
The solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the casino at the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 teachers from J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America, express their solidarity with the protesters at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English it condemns the intervention of the police requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in grèveafter walls and works of art had been barboiled with graffitis.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the debris did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses."
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable violation" of the freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism is only used to "delegitize and criminalize protest" and to try to make the reasons for mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee has thus diverted from the discussions that would still be essential.
The court officers require that criminal proceedings be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the debris.
Legitimation of Protestations
The young people of the Verdi Union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protestations are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Secretary for Youth of the Verdi Union.
As for Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann's Minister of Land Sciences (CDU), she has taken the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she said to the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and claims of students, they are evacuated.
The Party La Gauche has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the commune has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley."
There are important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research sites.
As of September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, the place of French sciences - with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration."
The signatories were the Vice Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Project Section Leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of well-known Soviet research institutes and companies.
There are the Institute of Electrotechnique in Moscow, the large firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armaments research.
Zelenograd (literary translation "Green City") draws its name from the woody hills in which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
S21 is much more than the landfill of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of works for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-line stations, with lanes that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time to be the relics of the 19th century transport technique that had the effect of sabot brake of modern rail traffic because it was once necessary a lot of time to move locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure - that's what you have to do.
This is why head-of-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about half-way on the TransEuropean Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe."
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and pilot car at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now being realised next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have wrecked it.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who charges the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic rather than the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that - if we believe the charts of the computer-generated planners - will be very verdoyant.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which we attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, EUR 6 billion will be embraced in the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will miss for other junction and swing points in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the 180 good kilometres Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built idling.
It would be very urgent to press the mushroom in this place.
But the S21 project is the effect of a braking hose.
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck of international traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government Reviews Airport Judgement
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the Hesse Administrative Tribunal's judgment concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP coalition had entrusted experts with legal review of the decision of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the rules concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case where the construction of the northwest drilling track of Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The authorization to attest 17 aircraft between 11: 00 and 5: 00 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal the judgement in cassation.
The opposition criticizes this time limit and tries to pressure the government representative to have the cirenounce in the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections that was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be conditioned as a total failure to speak.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to speak, "said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by referring to the electoral slogan of the FDP" We hold our promises. "
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's reproach that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "lawyers and redness."
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression."
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erased.
US banks repay aid
The large US banks, very affected by the crisis, are defending their ties with the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid provided under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the assistance received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to eliminate the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to the managers and the payment of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the banks that are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of the Bank of America, was specifically interested in thanking American taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by rebuying the investment bank Merrill Lynch to the strongest of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money in financial markets in order to free itself from State guardianship.
The US bank could thus launch a capital increase of $20 billion from Thursday, reported the CNBC chain quoting the banking community.
Citigroup's spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the release of the current holding position of Chief Reactor Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Administration of the German ZDF chain, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who led ZDF's Berlinois editor, was the great favorite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the intendant of the ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed that the Board of Directors should extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but that had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for Brender's reconduction and 7 others had voted against. Brender's deportation by vote represented a cohort, although predictable, for Schächter.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already allowed to hear several weeks before the vote, not to take Brender back to his position.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused that the contract of the highly estimated Chief Reactor be extended by invoking the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's information programming had decreased under Brender.
For this reason, protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, and the growing political influence on the ZDF was faded.
At the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it will not have been used for anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and romantic languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (a national German daily).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first at the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
He then continued his course: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the period; then he was a correspondent in Washington in 1991 / 1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenographins" (bimonthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinois Editor.
After Brender's disgrace, while he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendent's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider requesting the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory commissions.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender, had vaguely maneuvered with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehementness in his decision to limoger Brender.
With this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, as the Board of Directors could elect it without suspecting it to place a political partisan at the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked left-hand liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after one year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more reconciling: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must be used to close the selected study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be re-identified to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions."
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less examinations
Since the beginning of the estudiantine protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly expressed in the mouth the expression in the fashion: "étudiability."
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," can be read in a paper of about 30 pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the slippage, which was significantly detrimental to students' ability to study.
In addition, "study ability" should in future be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies.
The modules as well as the bottom must be carefully examined to see if one cannot avoid this feeling of choking that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative."
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every five years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorielset programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Service
For this purpose, the Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Act on Higher Education Institutions.
As a result, only one test will be required to close his studies.
The organisation of the studies must be more flexible, and it must be possible to guarantee recognition of the notes of other higher education institutions and to simplify access to the Master.
By the end of next year, the "study ability" of all academic cycles should have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but critics were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like to see the organisation of educational policy no longer happen in the future "behind the closed doors" of the Ministers and rectors of universities.
No later than after the educational strike, students as persons concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future diplomats of higher education were supported by the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He calls for the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduated to enrol in a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder ensure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master studies and as good as possible conditions of study.
The Länder must therefore hire more instructors.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in bribes of troubling sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the very coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate files."
Visibly destabilized and uncomfortable, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his German-Romanian writer colleagues such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, whom he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
In 1989 Söllner received the German Language Award in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enrolment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes, "so someone who has not been able to resist the Intimidation Trials of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary disequilibrium with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyms and low of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as much as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures the literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit," after having read the 914 pages of its own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes have guessed what real names were last hiding the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
On the contrary of Germany where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confuse.
Systematic clarification has been constantly curtailed and freed in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS), but the return of the files has been rather delayed since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psych, and in the end she had only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought it was possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many uneluctable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been spolied? The weighted reaction of listeners, in Söllner's confession, suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst to know than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative was coming there, shooting four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports product manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross went up at midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let himself drive into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself - he had not had alcohol, nor was he drunk with happiness.
He had a nice night, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because now it was about to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just been committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the final," that is, in the champions league thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be left blind by success. It will be a brutal fight not to revert."
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the champions league on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurface after the three expedient goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw to the lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match aller 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / match retour 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be shot by lot on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the full-minded entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in the one who had been lucky, who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an unwavering motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more brave, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe of success that sounded so good but that no longer made effects with the caregiver Babbel.
He triggered some magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that one would never believe possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, moved to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "He is someone who moves to action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For now, VfB Stuttgart needs more tenacity.
Like Gross, players and the manager do not overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won Glasgow before having had four days later a bad wake up in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't had a hard course yet.
That Heldt on the day of his 40th anniversary does not have the heart to party, even after the first win at home for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview of the goalie Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the game started.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, contempt Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbe criticism.
He had accused the direction of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertarian fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy so that his day of free after the games had been removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by a pure selfishness" enfoned Heldt and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two quadragenaries.
In all cast, they agreed for all the rest, that is, without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in success" said Heldt and Lehmann as a choir - and even the man with a plastic bag acquires it.
World Heavy Duty Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenge constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gestually.
But after twelve hard rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as World Heavy Duty Champion according to the WBC Federation version.
At the unanimity of the judges, he took up the points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains a world champion of heavy vehicles.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point victory at the unaminity of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko honestly defends his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine had already won twice the World Champion of WBO and WBC Federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't succeed in the KO so much.
Klitschko, released 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
The Challenge Johnson must have accepted his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left-hand side.
Johnson, eleven smaller centimeters, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's beatings, thus impeding Klitschko to bring into play his right against dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenge, tried most of all to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his beatings only very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenge had made a lot of noise in the capital of Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko to treat him with "vilain zombie" which "is not really capable."
During the weigh on Friday, the champion couldn't help provoking Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko set again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without combat.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and was in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rush is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Hague who, having trapped the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, The Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company is considering playing this game now at the Wembley stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front attack by the opposition: the head of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of Kunduz.
The SPD parties and La Gauche (die Linke) ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After examining the latest information about Kunduz's aerial attack, the opposition defended the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a contrevity" on the murderer strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the release of information of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 8: 00 p.m. newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in substance, the content of the report available to NATO which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of lafrappe was in reality not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the US air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz Military Commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked on Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to take a decision before the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Verts Renate Künast party are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices to express doubts about the real reasons for the removal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information from the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg about the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein as well as a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
To date, he has not received a response.
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was to be set up on the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychiatric patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our ominous rooms, we can unhindered the smartest dreams and fantasies.
However, who, awakened, has a dream experience, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the camanas, psychose and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and disgusting thoughts are very often manifested during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristote, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 saw "a great resemblance between madness and dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychose with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that make it up."
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a character of a comic band.
His body is in two dimensions with criarded colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, it floats at the rush of the ceiling.
He's feeling a hit.
Behind him the creatures of the winged devil, grimating, the bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They chase him, give him kicks with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Typical, wicked, screaming voices, coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of its stereo chain, making it a loop and attaches it to a crochet attached to the ceiling.
He goes up on a buckle and the loop goes around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's getting out of here.
Let it be a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to tear off the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychosis, the last 2-year date, the first almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
During the psych I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in its life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which make them suffer from hallucinations, megomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignifying, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like dream, psychose opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the psychiatry department of the CHU in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenia is in the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is as in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in his life an hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
The disgusting thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do this kind of cabrioles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have little brain damage.
It is assumed that neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what is still unexplained is how the anomaly of the neuronal system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
As well, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
What is crazy, says Lübeck's Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get out of it while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a question of point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports about hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head."
hallucinations are many of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychosis, but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently cooled; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrow of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognize that they have experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town of Mecklembourg-Pomerania earlier and goes to high school.
A young girl all to make normal to true say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the rebirth, a young, thin, long chestnut-haired boy may speak to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, astonished - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees, and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young sympathy.
Am I crazy? She asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are, in general, scary.
Often the visions are wealthy.
When she is in class, it happens that she cannot take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night the appearances are, in general, scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and much too late, she often cannot make a distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimating faces or the girl with blood entailles on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or friends about it, they'd take her for a crazy one.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her ferry last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact on the Internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, the probability is great that he has hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain's not busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was a little girl and often played by herself.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, that the man she called daddy, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
It is the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience," according to Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinguished from those in acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too conscientious we are sadly in a fast tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head doctor of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a serious, painful disease but that also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of changing the consciousness awakened by the dream.
The living oniroid are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the living one and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awakening.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience an engine paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that is detrimental to his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from reality.
It's a state of mental boundaries between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world is taking place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organisational capacity that is given to us, to us men, not to plunge into the negation of loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplantation; during that time, his body is sentenced to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen plunges in a world that he has created of all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his ankle caring about his health.
He lives in the middle age among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is removed by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfing with his hospital bed in the nephew of the Alps and meets a Korean mafieuse.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally distinguished from every dream.
The dream is a quite different state, he writes in describing what he has lived.
On the contrary, memories from mental travel are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more separate and more intensive than real life.
The intensity of this experience shines the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroid delusions, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in the state of the day.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At 27, the children will take over from the editions house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he said to the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, Hubert Burda publisher sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 years of age and are firmly committed to integrating society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years old, at the Spiegel.
All details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
It will also have to be seen if they are capable of doing so.
We cannot impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish both the children and the company.
Burda had reported last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-Director-General in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technological sector.
He then took over the Treasury sector, that is to say he was responsible for the capital of the company and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's name is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years "
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have been led by a capital bubbles, who have made huge unhappy speculations by thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, "said Burda.
I do not see myself in the role of the country as Springer could be, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken much too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can wish, about beauty and well-being, within reach of hand.
This is the quesemble objective set El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao mall (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, specialist in laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a power radius, with in particular a tea lounge, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contacting exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relax area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where one can benefit from the most innovative face care, body care and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, by offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program properly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to make all the muscles of the body work.
And if, after we have made our body work, we want to go through the hairdressing room, Teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where one offers rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the slogan of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10: 00 a.m. to 10: 00 p.m.
Diverse decolletates
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The form of take-off, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated take-off. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, is dote of the electric car
The power company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, has created the "Oficina LIVE."
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electrical Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements on mobility, by carrying out approaches, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In the end, the idea is to start what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come to join the project.
These are the three cities selected by the government under the MOVELE Plan to launch the installation of the electric car.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquillity" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would have today had a landscape of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has allocated €800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 ancillary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than €3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with self-government communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20 000 m ² of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Car Show, a meeting space for professionals and engine enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m ², where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
It will not only be possible to find motorcycles and collection cars, but also to find in ClassicAuto Madrid items of any kind related to the world of the engine.
For example, at flag exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, journals, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outside suitability test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Ability tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sport spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system, called i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horse gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the forward seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control board and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and orders, as well as vivid colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrasts with the sobriety of German products, and in particular with the Volkswagen Golf, that all want to surpass.
This compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this is a large safe with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horse gasoline engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and its control of its consumption.
Although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not make a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is, the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the track change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed regulator, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Pack Premium which, for another 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, two-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make much kilometers per year will be able to choose the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horse gasoline 2.0 engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a high level of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever dazzled us, dressed in as elegant models as sexys for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady."
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or navigating on the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
The truth is, it's more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what costs, for example, iPhone data subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at The Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandbrother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what the fact of renouncing data when crossing a border or looking desperately for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it has been a long time since it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have made a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of rate, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to rentabilise their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other Internet searches.
Without a subscription and without a slut.
It is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with life access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm watching my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I think it is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If Barack Obama took office as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, she chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, no doubt, the most important of her life: the award to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar colour, a yellow drawing green with shiny reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
As well as at a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States is following the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to give back the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for taking office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, it was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heel green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hair has also changed: the hair is now raised while it was wearing them leaved the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Women's Feminity and Career in Spain," carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15-75 years, does not leave any room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their professional career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have a low-stable job, start up in a couple earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back entry into life as a couple and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling together. This figure is rising to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to repulse the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised has a broad influence on maternity, but less on the date of common start of life, "CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado explains.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the age of marriage between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age on average.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have done elementary education are getting married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done middle or higher level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and upon arrival of a child, "said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, hearing the universal motto "Because I am worth it well."
Joyeux Noël's protagonist, one of the most elegant actresses in the international scene, thus joined other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, from yesterday and today, met for the annual award in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
The Ace Poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about 30 "radiographs" of writers who have passed through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does not do it according to the foreseeable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting, and Vincent does not save spawning or illumination.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and relectures.
I'll leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulsion that I felt without naming it: pleasure against funeste destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegiance Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of the remord, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre summits of universal literature, which must be engraved by the north face, on which the best mountaineers are still leaving and always taken."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a land owner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of magnitude. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry dearly pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and did so in his own leak and invoking posteriority with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed:" beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the worms of Spenser:" Sleep after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life, tired death ravites. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she would tell him that Edward VII was eyeing him between the azalees or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent was beyond madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if not try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What did Benet try if it wasn't to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do, if not to aspire the glory of this man, that he may serve him as a pieddestal? "
A coward aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent next to her and our dog, a melted blood, saved from the SPA and weighing not more than six kilos, and without saying, they assaulted her two feet that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun about assaulting a small defenseless animal, which was in addition on a leash.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she hurt these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been glowing all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the local police station even if we doubt that this is a great deal of use and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the assassins were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to mistreat a defenceless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The Michelin Tire Manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage helmet wear, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmet wear, as it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safer products" and stated that it contributes to this objective through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet incentive campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be," will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure its widest diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles began to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the trade union of the Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger car derivatives, pick-up, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand have not been dissipated, however, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
For example, in addition to restrictions on bank credit limitations, other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of poor economic conditions must be added.
In view of this situation and the difference in the number of passenger vehicles, the purchase aid for the 2000E did not serve much.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks of itself.
Yesterday at Ganvam, it was again recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The concessionaire association is planning a year 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As has been done with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as will be done with ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for new registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, although by its way of action it can also help to avoid many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant shall act by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system through the driver's shot.
But the latter does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in turn, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of component, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called smart emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four sinks with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors pushes back the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April - probably on 8 -, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that he will need more time to conclude Opel's rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, said that each point of the plan had been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contact potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch Skyper car manufacturer's application, supported by the Russian group Converg, is becoming important.
In case there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche's engineers left the Boxster S and managed to make it less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, first, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual built roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winners, to set up sports bucks, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they renounced the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six other kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK double clutch box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on roads from California's secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as unforgettable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we had not tested such a small and light model that at the same time guarantees so much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to heal his musclesat low speed for the time required, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that changes the rugging of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The surface of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the hens nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made an act of presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found ice cream in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultraleger car, of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate love of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlette of home parades, the singer displays her face as bad as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl."
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a shiny triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the arduous field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences that Dusko Ivanovic's team suffered. She is thus at the head of her group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show which, with eight baskets at three points was the best of her team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great amount of engagement and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, left it to pretend that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "minus six" evaluation already left it to pretend that this night was not going to be the best of Brazil.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's that we don't win so easily in their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making the yolks take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, who were injured but far from dead, needed to chase some hard actions to take the air, and it was at this time that the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, gave the meter a reassuring score (54-67), and the premises managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything for all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they had earned for the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for misconduct, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost nowhere in Greece in the face of the Olympiacos and gave it head of the Euroligue Group B, in a game marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the scale of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter-time, made it possible to make the Andalusian dream. An aggressive defence and three baskets at three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blurred the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the release for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The interior players and the Lithuanian Linas Kleizas magnet, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
It's impossible to climb up.
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, showed themselves superior and even managed to equate the difference of the meeting disputed at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chew.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last release of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos was implacable when the players were pressing and showing their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine having the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and city where you wish to work.
For a week since the application worked, the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker "feels ill-paid," explained Trovit's product manager Albert Ribera in a press release.
According to the data available to Trovitfrom its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros per year and one French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 gross euros annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid work in Spain is that of server, with 11 592 euro net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the Internet over the past three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overturned President will have to abandon the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, after his term of office, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention that leaving the embassy before the end of the established time limit: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant mark in the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize the debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions purchase assets to be mobilized.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been almost finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the rouages, as the ECB did, with their award at one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterogeneous measures, and we are witnessing a reverse in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of scholarships and the differences in business bonds are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, leading to an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened by a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to shut down the moral risk defenders, who were again trying to cause a case of awareness among world economic policy officials who had freed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is to decreate a new day of Action de grâces.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissipates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country not to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has led the Greek government to transparency and made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excess in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt are increasing to the extent of European business obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and our differences continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecasting indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their stimulus models and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back at the expense of a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augure much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "caution is mother of sureté."
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his intervention, followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission, eight-closed.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and an additional EUR 60 000 million between that date and 2030, if the current nuclear power plants are to remain open.
If not, the necessary investment would not amount to $60,000 but would amount to $95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investment should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18 000 MW are needed, with other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the Government's recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what its company demands, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "ad hoc" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they are mature and that a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus's handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, lasts five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaborative protocol to create the Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona's first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession highway in Australia, a market on which she is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The site is an estimated Australian $1,700 million tunnel (about €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city hall wishes to be able to have them by the end of 2014.
After having chosen the public / private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists to be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment is US $1,700 million (about EUR 1,047 million) and in the last phase are facing three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against Acciona's team, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that took the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatization, but entering it is a great challenge, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, which still remains an unvalidated step for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just conquered a place in this market by its 30% participation in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona has a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalinization sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind turbine park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the consolidation of companies responsible for building and managing Adelaine's desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for infrastructure construction and management.
The underground toll lane, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and that Northern Link (north link), is called to link the western Toowong highway to the peripheral lane to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the award will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll line will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lines, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide US $500 million (EUR 308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief much more fructify, which yesterday mentioned the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC gets a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is being called upon to build a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been charged with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the site is scheduled for early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore gets adjumped to Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about €3 million per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been chosen from 16 agencies that have come to the Renfe's call for tender, of which four have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated over 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a recurrent one.
An application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephony subsidiary followed up with other operators and opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
At the beginning, Orange's application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait 2010 for it to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which places them in third and fifth position of the clubs that poached the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA League of Champions does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of large clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, had won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern in Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Madrid Atlético) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the third final perceive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and not more than 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça poached 2.5 million for winning the Super European Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion has 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid on the basis of the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25-29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public acquisition offer (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares were completed at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual evaluation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
Jerez's group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If so, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and of the judicial goes and comes from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leading position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the Chair of the group.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar societies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new misappropriation of funds cannot be discarded.
With regard to the credit to the Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Commission on the Market of Values (CNMV) approved yesterday the OPA of exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation as it understood that its terms were aligned with existing standards and that it considered "sufficient" the content of the explanatory sheet presented, following the amendments applied on December 2, 2003.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,144,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao awards.
He further explained that 5,572,778 million shares had been fixed and that they could in no way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, and he indicated that the price had been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then to processing and offering them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex of the North American Solera group is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and motorisations have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies start working.
This is a very hard job, because each of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price recorded.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is established which can be click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If this is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in one week if the process is moving very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information about the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or the Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
For documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for the management of break parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but she does it in the United States.

This company offers ten different tools, with the flagship product AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessment of claims, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.

This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it little, not more than ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it was removed from the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows to auction on declared wreck vehicles.

Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.

Internet logs of accidental cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.

Garage description in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential part of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, then it can print the quote to give it back to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that that intended for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that the mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow to select a door and turn it to see the internal face.
