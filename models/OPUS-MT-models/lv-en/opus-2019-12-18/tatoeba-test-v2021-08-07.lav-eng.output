When an English-speaking person notices that a foreigner with whom he speaks doesn't understand something from what he says, he repeats exactly the same thing, but louder as if this man is deaf. At no point he doesn't think that his choice of words might be complicated, or that his expression could be easily misunderstood by a foreigner, and that he could say it more easily with other words. As a result, not only does he still understand what he says, but he is also irritated about being considered deaf.
