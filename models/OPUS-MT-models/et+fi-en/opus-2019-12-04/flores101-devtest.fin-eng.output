The United States Gymnastics Union supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the unacceptable need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the opinion of the United States Olympic Committee that it would be better for our athletes, our teams and their sports to move forward through a meaningful change within the organisation than by losing our status as a kind of alliance.

This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provided information that is not usually found in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to the scientists, the animal's feather cover was all chestnut brown and light or carotenoid-coloured.
In addition, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of birds closing down.
Because the feathers of the dinosaur do not have a well-developed rud, but they have other feather properties - such as weathering rays and weathering rays - the scientists concluded that the blade is likely to be a later stage of evolution of these other properties.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature control or music consumption. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the scientists claimed that the sample was derived from an adult individual feather suit rather than from the infant's falling asleep.
Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the scientists claimed that the sample came from an adult individual feather suit rather than from a boy's falling asleep.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at Gaziantep's main police station in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty people.

The work carried out was first theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect the effects of tidal water between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the gravity of the moon affects the earth, causing tidal water, the attraction of the Milky Way also affects the dwarf ellipses of the archer.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy surround it as a kind of beam and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally not been a state-of-the-art technology: voters close themselves to the booth and place in the envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper in which they have entered the candidate they want.
Once the authorities have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.

The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the series of events. In the evening, volunteers count their votes under strict supervision and in accordance with the procedures laid down.

The first of them was a flotation where his first bill was not finished. 36 out of 116 participants also failed to get to the finish line.
In his second competition, he reached the tenth place in the women's seating class with a common result of 4.41.30, which was 2.11.60 times slower than the first Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1.99.02 times slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Gy√∂ngyi Dan.
Four skiers from the women's seating group were unable to get to the end of their bill, and 45 out of 117 skiers in Giant Slalom were unable to invest in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh's police found a stolen laptop and a cell phone.
Assistant Chief Inspector D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Even though three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed when the rescue service released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to a James Paget hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of his son.
He's under arrest for prosecution and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be corrupted, as his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have considered that the publication of images may be detrimental to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University states that "journalists seem to be balancing dangerously if they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for the charges in general, has given the journalists the impression that no further comment will be made, at least before the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to pass in the way they passed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects discussed were, according to the information, the future status of Jerusalem for both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the Treaty, and the Palestinian Authority accepts such a presence for only five years.
Forest guards were to closely monitor the shooters involved in the additional surveillance of pests, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
The eligible volunteers were recruited as a joint project of the National Park and Wild Animals Service and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) and as part of the shooting programme of the Federation of Shots and Shots.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of NPWS Park Protection and Cultural Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Mr Martley recognised nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martley's fifth temporary election council in four years.
Last month, a delegation appointed by the President recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at taking the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martley's response to the extensive anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
From time to time, the demonstrations that had become violent started with the elections that had not been held, some of which had to be held as early as 2011.
Some 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns for four persons.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, the Ministry announced that Apple had informed it about 34 other cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry replied by calling the postponement of Apple's study "very unfortunate."
The earthquake tested the Marianas at 7.19 local time (Friday at 21.19 Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency was told that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre also reported no evidence of tsunami.
Former Filipino police have held Hong Kong tourists hostage for kidnapping their buses in the capital of the Philippines in Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as well as the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took an older woman's place when she needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza died in the fire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went to a doctor's career.
He trained as a obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature childbirth at idleness.
His studies showed that the administration of the hormone will speed up the development of the lungs in the foetus.
On Wednesday, Xinhua announced that an official research team had found two black boxes, the flight recorder.
Other wrestlers also showed Luna respect.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and Luna passed away on the night of two months.
Dustin's "Goldu" Runners commented: "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Before the federal parliamentary elections in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of opponents to the Republic of Australia had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign, Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of the Ministry of Supply, claimed that she felt that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the respondents shared his views and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain the last monarch in Australia.
At the end of the study, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a Republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe that Australia should never become a Republic.
The Olympic winner was supposed to participate in the 100 m and 200 m liberation of the Commonwealth Games and three message races, but his condition has been uncertain due to the pain.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to relieve pain because they are prohibited in competitions.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, professor of IT at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime figure known to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February with different equipment and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to the planet as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are born, and especially how the Earth was born, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
The term of office of 53-year-old Cuomo as governor began earlier this year and last month he signed a bill legalising the marriage of the same sex.
He called the rumors "political jawbone and ridiculous."
He is believed to be running for president in 2016.
The US Aviation Authority claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than an older technology based on ground-level radar, enabling air traffic controllers to better locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and trains on the ground will not stop at Wembley. Also, parking and access parking services are not available at the match site.
Concerns about lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in Science revealed the development of a new species of birds in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had developed in two generations, although the series had been believed to last much longer. It was due to the mutual increase of the original Darwinian Peoples (Geospiza fortes) and the newcomer species of the cactus circus (Geospiza contemportris).
Gold can be worked on in all forms. It can also be shrouded into small objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rotated and red, and can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures in books called "book paintings."
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can do the meter by using red cabbage juice.
Potassium juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e. alkali) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the test chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outer layer, which seems strange and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the Mino towns of Greece in Greece and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men were bathing in the same facilities at the same time.
When you call someone over thousands of miles, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost right away.
The satellite was sent to space in a rocket ride, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To take a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet long.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the biggest thing the bike has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Under them come medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small cat animals (including pet cats that are separated) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds with much higher numbers.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological compartment. According to this concept, every cat animal has its own special function, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are among the most social cat animals and live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males of each other's origin and sometimes up to thirty females and puppies.
The females are usually close to each other, forming sisters and daughters of a great family.
Lion flocks behave in a similar way to wolf or dog flocks. These animals are surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not to other large cats), and they are also very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not very well), swim, jump far and draw five times as strongly as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same family of large cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats can boar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of the lion, but more like a phrase consisting of grumbling, screaming words.
Oselots like to eat small animals, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can catch them. Almost all animals hunted by oselot are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the oselots trace and find edible animals, that is, by the smell of prey, sniffing around the land where they have been.
Oselots see very well in the dark because of the blurred vision and move very unnoticed. They hunt by merging into their environment and then capturing the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves over a mountain line or over a river or over a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so in order to be a strong competitor the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
When a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population over time.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations seem so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process a process of sorting, which only means the emergence of a new species, which is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale, and they use carbon dioxide that people inhale out of.
The plants produce their food from the sun by contacting them, and they prefer the shadow.
We make our house out of plants and make clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
Messaurus was a great beast of his own time, so he was afraid of anything but other messaurs.
There were over 70 razor sharp teeth in its long jaws, plus an extra toothpick on the palate, so no one who hit its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue, and its diet included turtles, big fish and other mossaurs, and it could even be cannibal.
It also attacked everything coming into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual party delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a rodent called a peanut mouse.
The second difference between the poor and the women were eating their food sitting on a chair, but the rich preferred to organise a joint feast where they lay on their side while eating their meals.
It was not possible to serve food at the feast of ancient Rome that came to Europe from America or Asia in the later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, for example, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a master temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the home of God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests strive to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and celebrations.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called most sacred, to which only priests could go.
Sometimes the temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers called zikurates.
The top of the tower was God's special sanctuary.
In the warm air of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open air.
Women put food in the yard, and the shops were just open desks on the streets. The building materials used were stone.
There were no large forests in Kanaan land, so the tree was extremely expensive.
The Norwegian sagas said that Erik Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite what he found, the Eskimos were already living on the island.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map was drawn on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true, although something has been written behind the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776" are written upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that the large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 ¬Ω inch times 24 ¬Ω inch) was wrapped in a roll for storage in the early days.
It is therefore likely that the label was only added as a label.
D-Day lived as an invasion and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was in the hands of the French, the French, who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the attackers and did not fight against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1944, the code name of the attack was Operation Drago.
The United States and Free France only released the south of France in two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture common to a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city state, and it also sort of defines the size of society.
The city states are the predecessors of nations. The civilizational culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from several generations to another long-term cultural footprint and to a greater spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are usually not considered to be the right civilizations.
During the United States War on Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was Congress - on the basis of the Confederal Articles.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, in the absence of national executive or judicial authority, it had to rely on the often uncooperative authorities of the L√§nder to implement all its legislation.
Nor did it have the power to amend the tax laws and the customs duties between the L√§nder.
The amendment of the articles required the unanimous approval of all the L√§nder, and the L√§nder were so obscure about the central government that their representatives were often not present.
In addition to the German national team, the Italian football team is the second most successful in the world. It won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor sport.
Winter sports are among the most popular in northern regions, and even in international matches and the Olympic Games, Italians compete in them.
Japan has almost 7 000 islands (the largest is Honshu), so Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
In view of the fact that the islands of Japan are on the brink or as a group, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago' in geographical terms.
Taiwan was beginning to be known in the 14th century, when European sailors who sailed by mentioned the island using its name Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India trading company set up a base in South-West Taiwan, at the same time introducing a change in the cereals production methods of the indigenous population and hiring Chinese workers for their rice and sugar crops.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan the Qing Dynasty province in 1885.
After a defeat in 1895 in the first Chinese-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonosek Treaty, which gave Taiwan the sovereignty of Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the three windows room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the world's most common styling image size is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its image ratio.
The size of 35 mm is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the ratio of this size (when divided by twelve to obtain the simplest size ratio) is 3: 2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) either correspond or are very close to this image ratio.
The often abused and much mocked third rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamism in the image but still maintains some order.
According to this, the most effective position of the main object is at the point where the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three-thirds intersect (see for example).
In this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be examined closely.
Christianity had united European countries for over a thousand years, despite the differences in languages and customs.
The power of it everywhere affected all the kings and the people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money is intended for that kind of use.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many people to question the completion of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began the German sea island.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies of military and civilian equipment, even though the blockade was in breach of the generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the last two hundred years.
Britain mine international waters to prevent ships from entering entire oceans and even put ships at risk.
Since the tactics triggered only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, most of the attitudes of citizens and states were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations decided to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous superior) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was a unique way to describe different periods: every phase or family in power in China was its own dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable time between each dynasty and the division of regions. The most well-known of these periods was the period of 60 years between the three kingdoms of the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these times, many nobles fought fiercely in pursuit of the throne.
The season of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest ages in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for access to the highest seat in Xi'an's mighty palace.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of a metric system, the transition from sovereignty to republicism, the principle of nationality and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the posts also opened up to all male applicants, thus allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the military because military values were now based on ability rather than class status.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira and was located on a light-bearing Mount Nur.
The cave itself, whose time the tooth left alone, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located in one of the mountains that rise north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if you know it exists. Once you get inside the cave, the isolation is perfect.
You can only see clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. Inside the cave you can see or hear very little about the earthly world.
There are several pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Giza Sphinx located on the plain of Giza in the valley of the Dead.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 2000s, is one of many great pyramids made for the glory of the dead pharaohs.
The upper plains of Giza, the Giza Necropolis, located in the valley of the Dead of Egypt, include several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of the rising spring looks like the letter "V 'and the sign of the falling spring is like a staple or a square missing a footnote.
The rising spring means that you should start with the tip and push the spring. The falling means that you should start with the frost (where you like the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The rising spring usually makes a softer sound, the falling spring is stronger and thicker.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed suspension marks are on the books for musical reasons, so they should normally be followed.
A gang of working women forced the horrified King Ludvig XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They came back to Paris in the chariots, surrounded by a crowd, shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows completely.
At some point, one of the crowds waved the head of a bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Philippines themselves had to pay the war costs of the invasion of the Philippines to the American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial administration to cover a significant part of the costs and to pay interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Government of the Philippines.
The basic benefits of imperialism in the United States were, of course, the giants of the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people.
In order to understand the Templars, you need to understand the background in which the organization was created.
The era of events is usually discussed in the middle of the heart, in the history of Europe between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The cardiac medieval period was preceded by an early medieval period followed by a late medieval period, which is generally thought to have ended in approximately 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that virtually covers a wide range of ideas about the "technological thrust," i.e. the necessity of technology, in such an absolute sense that human destiny is guided by the logic of scientific laws and their emergence by technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have two common basic ideas: firstly, that technological development itself follows a route which is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and secondly, that technology in turn has natural rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, it could be argued that inventing a car will inevitably lead to road development.
On the other hand, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods will be developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars leads to more accidents in road transport, leading to new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was an important material in romance and ambushed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography was considered to shape individuals; over time, the customs and culture typical of this geographical location were formed. As they were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrarily prescribed laws.
Constantinopol was considered to be the fashion capital of the feudal era of Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as the centre of luxury began in about 400 AD and continued until about 1100.
In the 1100's, its status weakened mainly because the crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more appreciated than the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at that time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinopol to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 900s and 1000's and the 1300s.
At first, clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication patterns, Western European styles may have been behind by 25-30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most important developments of the era, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes with crusades.
Self-subsistence farming is a cultivation where sufficient food is produced only to support the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple, often organic system using organic seeds in the eco-zone combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple ways to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers used self-sufficiency, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Sub-cultures bring together people of the same mind who feel rejected by the standards of society, thus enabling them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, place and / or sex of members.
Characteristics that define a sub-culture as own and distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality, geographical or multiple combinations of factors.
The members of the subculture often communicate their membership with the characteristic and symbolic use of style, including fashion, behaviour and their own slang.
One of the most common methods for demonstrating the importance of socialisation is to use the few unfortunate children who were left out of socialisation provided by adults, either as a result of negligence, misfortune or deliberate exploitation.
These children are called "wild." Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, rejection has been caused by parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical injury.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Others are said to be raised by animals, some are said to have lived on their own in nature.
If a wild child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he / she (within the framework of his / her physical limitations) acts in almost the same way as his / her guardian, for example by showing the same fear or indifference to humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. The timely support for learning (scaffolding) goes one step further.
The darts are not a learning method, but a tool to support individuals in their new learning experience, for example when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The darts can be both virtual and real. In other words, the teacher is kind of a dart, but so is Microsoft Office's little paper doll.
Virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, make suggestions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and growing, but some live.
We consider the foster home system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster home system is designed to provide a safe home, loving guardians, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The purpose of the investment of children is to meet all the basic conditions which they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines both mass communications and people-to-people communications.
The specific features of the Internet mean additional dimensions in the case of the purpose theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are presented as important influences for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal participation" and "continuous relations" as new aspects of the impact of the public's response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. only a few milliseconds long-lasting facial movements.
In particular, it has been argued that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks described in his article The President's Speech how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behaviour.
A study of the 20th century has shown that there are two stocks of genetic modification: latent and apparent.
The mutation increases new genetic variation, the choice removes it from the stock of variations.
With each generation, separation and recombination move the variation back and forth between these two warehouses.
It is difficult for a primate with a similar digestive system to humans to obtain enough amino acids from plants available on savannah.
In addition, there are serious consequences for the absence of them: slowing down growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins derived from leaves and pea plants, but it is difficult for primates like us to melt them without cooking them.
By contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digestible and also provides a high level of protein content containing all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problems' in a manner similar to that of savannah chimps today.
Stopping sleep means deliberately waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep again a little later (10-60 minutes later).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not wake up completely.
If you notice you turn off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include abundant drinking of fluids (especially water or tea known as diuretics) before going to bed, which makes it necessary to rise out of bed to urinate.
The amount of peace within a person corresponds to the amount of tension in his body and mind in the opposite way.
The less tension, the more positive his life force is. It is possible for everyone to find the perfect peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Buddhism of Tibet is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it added an idea of the stomach line, a great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including kundalin yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalin yoga, kundalin energy (lighting energy) is generated through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is a deity yoga. Visualizing the deities purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war, the clashes between systems, procedures and cultures led to a breakdown of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, an earlier ally had become enemies, leading to a cold war.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war really took place, because the surrogate armies were fighting on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence had already broken by 17 September 1939 and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise in Romania's bridge position.
However, these plans were made empty in almost one night, as more than 800 000 Soviet Red Army soldiers progressed to the country and created the front lines of Belarus and Ukraine after attacking the eastern parts of Poland, contrary to the peace agreement in Riga, the non-aggression pact in the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
It has traditionally been the task of the fleets to ensure that their own country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. The Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet mostly tried to block this traffic by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been tame about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them easily in order to obtain milk, hair, meat and hides.
Bovine goats were usually reared in flocks that migrated in mountain areas or other pastures. Often they are taken care of by goat shepherds, which were often children or young, such as the more famous shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons were made up of parallel wooden lanes only, they enabled the horses to draw the wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly less uniform roads at the time.
The track jams were introduced quite early to keep track in place, but gradually it was realised that the track would be more efficient if there were an iron strip on top of it.
It became common practice, but the iron consumed more than the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (i.e. a vertical man) developed.
The previous Australopithecus did not walk as continuously in the upright position.
The speciality of double-legged is found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4,2-3,9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can go to life in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often just like treating the symptoms of the disease, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, then we should find the roots of the problems and remove them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a great deal as a result of the scientific and technical advances made by mankind, and the problems have increased as a result of the overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After it had been approved by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlapi avoarks.
John Nixon read the document for the first time publicly in the Garden of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which allowed him to read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 open sheets of Dunlap known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like tyranny lizards.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk with their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all computers currently in use are based on the processing of data encoded in binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers or in the professional language of computer circuits bits.
Vomiting-like symptoms are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is a visible medicinal container or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the first aid guidelines for this poison on the label.
Entomologists use the term "bedbugs" specifically from this insect group.
The term comes from the fact that in the past the bugs have been very common. The bugs are insects that are well adapted to human parasites.
The predators and bedbugs are both nesting, adapted to live in their host's nest or cocoon.
There are approximately 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which is the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system including the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
The study has shown that women have a double tendency to develop MS compared to men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not for their own benefit or for their children.
These couples may, if they so wish, draw up a small adoption plan.
In adoption, biological parents give up their rights to parenthood, allowing the other couple to act as parents of the child.
The main task of science is to find out by scientific methods how the world works.
However, it is not only an experiment, and the experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations will also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
When Greek skills weakened in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in the body structure and behaviour are often highly dependent on the existence of inborn cycles and their emergence through biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not only reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely for a certain time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, the viruses, to plant their own DNA in the bacteria.
They performed two tests either with radioactive phosphorus in the phage or with radioactive sulphur in the phage protein.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the mutant component has affected, and whether it has affected gametes or other cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature sites in order to enjoy landscapes - including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation, park visits and familiarisation with ecosystem information.
One example is the visit to the Orangutans of Borneo, their learning and their photography.
Every morning, the inhabitants of small rural towns go to work in their car, and others come against them, whose job is where they left from.
In such dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and at the same time supports, a private car-based transport system.
Science now suggests that the vast carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and is using transport systems, almost everyone is complaining about transport systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely as many complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they cheat on a daily basis? Are transport planners just incompetent or is this something more fundamental?
The flow of traffic is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the flow of traffic, because the use of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform manner so that traffic flows usually have a reasonably good consistency and can be presented in a rough mathematical way.
In order to better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between (1) the flow, (2) the density and (3) the speed of the three main characteristics.
Understanding these relationships helps to scroll, design and maintain the road.
The insects were the first animals to take off. The ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings backwards against their bodies.
In this way, they have a wider range of small places to hide from the beasts.
Dragonflies and daisies are now the only insects that are unable to fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said the solar system was circling the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system was moving around the planet, including the sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
Amazon is the second longest and biggest river in the world, with more than eight times the water in it than the second in the biggest river.
Amazon is also the largest river in the world, 6 miles wide.
A full 20% of our planet's water that flows into the oceans comes from Amazon.
The actual Amazon River has a length of 6 387 km (3,980 miles), collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids from the stone continued until the end of the Old Reich, the size of the pyramids of Giza was never exceeded.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, who were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest state in the world.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language for its legislation and official communication.
Most of the people working in the state speak Italian as well as everyday language, but often Latin is used in religious supplies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican state are Roman Catholics.
People have known common chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they all occur naturally as their own and because they are also relatively easy to quarry with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorised everything made up of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more like the four forms of matter - solid, liquid, gas and plasma in the same order - but he also theorised that they would turn into other substances to form what we see.
Metallic alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic system contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals, but there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter, all of which consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that they could fit in trillions at the closing point of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when they came to the market.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing evolve, the value and uses of the pencil have become more repulsive.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and you never have to search for a sharpener.
You can only guess what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes around.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a core consisting of many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up the hill, and breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable core and are therefore prone to decomposition a minor or non-existent thrust.
The moon's surface consists of stone and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called its shell.
The thickness of the moon's shell is about 70 kilometers on the visible side of the Earth and about 100 kilometers on the reverse side of the moon.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker on the highlands.
There may be more dark sea areas on the visible side because the shell is thinner. Lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus primarily on what is behind people's behaviour or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and / or desires that they have embraced as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment make them do or do not do certain things.
Maslow's needs hierarchy theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start to lead their previous peers, there are generally two different behaviors. At the other end of the scale there is an attempt to stay "one of the guys" (or the likas).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, keeping discipline, assessing performance, sharing responsibility and keeping people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, man is transformed into an unidentified individual who feels that he has to change everything that the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the Group's successes and failures.
Such behaviour often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same quality as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members shall act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making powers than ordinary team members, because their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local government may not always understand this.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team that all members report to. An invisible team determines the level of demand of each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process that the creation of a learning organisation requires? One of the objectives of the systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of the organisation, creativity and inventiveness can be created.
As a result, a process in which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create an innovative culture and share information and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations reach higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to consciousness exploration, which is why it narrows the research area and makes it much more effective.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The increase in new technologies gives the opportunity to see and study the structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This will provide us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us to understand the processes of our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is thought to be strongly related to science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology which explores the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
An artificial intelligence study will try to get machines to perform automatically tasks that require intelligent operation.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and the identification of the handwriting, voice and face.
These have become differentiated disciplines focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
Nowadays, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and defence, just as it is part of many software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and often a teacher would like to take students to places where you can't get on a bus.
Technology offers a solution, i.e. virtual class excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a desk.
The virtual sharing of a class trip is an excellent way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina plan a website for their trip to the capital of the state. The website is renewed annually, but its old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of their blog experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the presence of the public usually changes things.
As students themselves are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to work to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to hover the world better around them." The need to feed the audience's interest to inspire students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages cooperation and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs can "enable students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and raise their point of view on the question that is being raised" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is an attractive bilingual capital of Canada, with a large number of art galleries and museums showing Canada's past and present.
Further south are the falls of Niagara and the north is, among other things, untouched, natural-beautiful Muskoka.
These and many other things create the impression of Ontario as a place which is considered by outsiders to be a legacy of Canada.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised by the next demographic comparison: more African-Americans live in the United States than citizens in Canada at all.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the biggest of them and the biggest of them in nature, like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France and are known as luxury beach sites.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it was allowed in the Comoros and Mayotte to have a lot of wind under its wings.
Europe's influence and colonialism began in the 14th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route in Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the north of the Sahel and the south and west of the Atlantic Ocean.
Women - All female tourists are recommended, regardless of their actual marital status, to say that they are married.
Using a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may experience as harassment. It is not unusual for someone to follow them, grabs the arm, etc.
Be strict when you fight men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not justify convergence!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 90s by Berber fishermen and was used by both Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese lost it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who founded the trading stations there.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting shopping places in Morocco.
In the old media, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as taginas, clay, leather products, water pipes and a wide range of tracksuits, but all of them are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city centre.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all excursions outside the city require preliminary investigation into the current state of fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, where you will find the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to move in Goma. The usual (local) charge is about 500 Congo francs for a short drive.
When this is combined with its relatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and there is an airport there.
It was added to the list of endangered sites of world heritage in 1990 due to the threat of sand in the desert.
It was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special program for the Wonders of the African World.
The city is a sharp opposite to other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic than African sense.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is located in the east of Mozambique, in the north of Zimbabwe and in the south of the Crocodilejoki River.
The area of the park is 19 500 km ¬≤ and is divided into 14 different natural areas, each of which supports a variety of fauna and natural plants.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily protection and entrance fee is levied in the park, as is the case in all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to buy Wild Card (wild card), which can either access part of South African parks or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong renders its name to the Hong Kong region and is the main target of many tourists.
The Hong Kong silhouette building circulation has been compared with the glowing column diagram, which is best reflected in Victoria's port water.
The best in Hong Kong can be seen by leaving the island and heading across to the Kowloon port area.
The vast majority of the city area of Hong Kong is located on a crowded filler site on the northern shore.
This is where the British colonial hosts took ownership, and if you look for signs of colonial history in the region, it is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the largest mangrove forest area in the world, extending 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the outskirts of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared the World Heritage Site of Unesco. The part on the Indian side of the forest is called Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not just mangroves, but include some of the last remains of the mighty jungles that once covered the whole plain of Ganges.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about one third of which is covered by water or swamp areas.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Indian antiques and approximately 30 000 akis deer.
The buses leave the intercounty bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially in the east and to Jakar and Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30 p.m.
Since buses within the area are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of counties are run by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Bouquet taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 noultrum) and Punekhaa (200 noultrum).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is on the verge of a rope. It crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in Guyana in France.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long, and it has two three and a half metres' width.
The bridge's underpass is 15 meters. Construction finished in August 2011, but the bridge was opened for traffic only in March 2017.
According to the timetable, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian border stations are expected to be completed.
The Guardians were the most important of the original groups living in the current East Paraguay area, living as half-herder hunters, but also self-sustaining.
Other indigenous tribes, such as guaycur√∫t and Payagu√°t, lived in the Chaco area, who managed to hunt, collect and fish.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "giant Indian province," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples of the country in the 16th century.
The Spaniards began a colonial period that lasted three hundred years.
Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity since the establishment of Asinci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is famous for the world's best polo team and players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the Las Ca√±itas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
The Argentine Poles Union provides news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is linked to GBP.
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, the pounds of England go all over the islands, and Stanley often goes with credit cards and the US dollar.
Credit cards are unlikely to be valid in the outer islands, although the British and US currencies may be valid.
It is almost impossible to change the currency of the Falklands themselves outside the islands, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there is summer when the northern hemisphere is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and in summer months temperatures above 30 degrees are common.
Winter can be deceptively colder: temperatures rarely fall to the frost side, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no special rainfall and dry periods: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities advise you to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from other wild animals.
Bison, deer, bears and almost all large animals can attack, even though they may look very generous.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Please also take into account that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid importing or manufacturing strongly fragrant foods and keep the camp tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced a notorious internaval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships - German, American and British - refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except one British cruiser, while almost 200 American and German lives were lost.
The peaceful assembly in the city during the Mau movement's struggle for independence led to the death of Grand Chief Tupu Tamesse Lealophi III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and continue from the North Long Bay to the South Devonport.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches that are safe to swim, and the mighukawa trees give most of them shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata in the wealthy districts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches, and the coastline edge a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most important local beer is "Number One." It is not multi-dimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are several French wines worth experimenting with, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better preserved on the way.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but careful people can easily find bottled water.
The idea of flat white milk coffee is a guest for Australians. A small black coffee is known as espresso, and cappuccino is offered with a large amount of whipped cream instead of foamed milk. Tea is offered without milk.
Cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So take heed of the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish are found north of 1770 near the beaches and estuaries from October to April. Occasionally, they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people, most sharks fear people and most likely swim away.
The estuary crocodiles are not actually living in the sea, but their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The passenger is given an advance period of peace of mind when booking that when he gets to the destination he will have a place to sleep.
Travel agencies often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation through the travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to and from the airport and even combined air and hotel packages.
They may also maintain your reservation if you need time to consider your offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, all changes and requests should first be directed through the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of participants in the music festival decide to camp in the region, and most participants consider it an essential part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive in time to get the campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the main stage music shows have finished, there may be places where music plays late into the night.
Some festivals have separate campsites for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during the winter season, check the location of the cabin, because passing through the ice causes terrible noise to the worst parts.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please check the conditions).
Casinos typically do their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and watches are usually not available, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood and in casino facilities.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks at the house. However, drunkenness weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to use cars with high latitude or mountain pass must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or extremely cold temperatures.
There's little friction on the icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive the same way you drive on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow can rain in a very short time so much that the car gets caught.
Snow or wind-driven snow and the moisture or ice accumulated in the vehicle windows may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries and traffic usually operates year round without interruptions.
Safari are perhaps the largest attraction in Africa and the highlight of the visit for many.
The word safari refers to land travel, which is intended to look at the magnificent African fauna, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come near cars, and ordinary equipment is good enough to look at them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as scrub walking, camping safari and hiking) means either a few hours or several days of camping.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two Summer Olympics since it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation may be difficult.
Cancellation practices vary, but according to the situation at the end of March, most of the cancellation practices based on the corona virus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were to be held.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yen, usually around 7 000 yen.
Irrigation of wet clothes can help them dry. In many hotels it is possible to borrow ironing iron and board even if they are not in the room itself.
If ironing iron is not available or if you do not particularly care about ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways of cleaning water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in closed bottles.
Tourists can run into pests that they are not used to in their own region.
Pesticides can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison and infect diseases.
The actual infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are generally not counted as pests.
Tax-free purchases mean the possibility of buying in certain places products exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Tourists who are heading towards heavy taxation countries may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
In the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, the most challenging driving conditions exist on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway because it repeatedly runs in remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving country roads, be careful: there are a lot of steep ups and downs, narrow lanes and sharp benches.
The speed limits imposed are considerably lower than in previous and later sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km per hour) - and their absolute compliance is even more important than in general.
Strangely enough, mobile phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rough and versatile, resembling the Austrian pastries of the southern neighbour.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made all year round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you need small but sturdy pastries, try one that's called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.

As 17 000 islands are to be selected, Indonesian food is an upper concept covering a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
However, if the concept is used without further definitions, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Java cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, with a large coverage of simply seasoned dishes. Java-preferred flavourings include peanuts, chili, sugar (especially java coconut sugar) and a wide range of aromatic spices.
The riders are rider's footrests hanging on both sides of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but there may be security concerns, because the rider's legs may be clinging to them.
If the rider falls off the horse's back, but the foot is caught in the foot, the runaway horse may come after him. A number of precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders use high-interest riding boots with a smooth and rather narrow base.
Some saddles, especially the English ones, have a safety bar that will allow the safety strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocham√≥n Valley - Chile climbing target number one, known as South American Yosemite. The valley has a variety of large granite walls and rock cliffs.
From the peaks there are breathtaking views. Climbers from around the world are constantly forming new routes to its endless walls.
Skiing species, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that count from snow to snow with skis or snowboard attached to feet.
Counting is an important tourist activity and many people sometimes called ski bums plan whole holidays around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings for skiers have already been made in 5000 B.C.!
The Alpine skiing sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegian opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Backdoor skiing: this activity is also known as a skiing, ski hiking or hiking.
It is related to Alpine skiing-style camping or mountain climbing, but it does not usually include such activities, as the latter is practised in steep terrain, and it requires much more rigid skis and monos.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you can go a little faster than on foot, but you can only very rarely get to the same speed as when you ski on maintained warehouses and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries; under normal circumstances travelling through several countries would mean completing visa applications and passing passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area is a bit like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to re-check your passport.
Also, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques; some tax authorities define all goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location. In North America, for example, newer objects are counted as antiques than in Europe.
Craft products may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeers are an important industry for the Sami people, and the related culture is also important for many other professions.
However, even traditionally not all Sami people have participated in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities and regarded the reindeer as mainly traction.
Today, many Sami people work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Saami.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misunderstandings about the Roma population.
If your visiting country is subject to a travel information document, it may affect your travel medical insurance and travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it is worth asking other countries for advice in addition to yours, even though their advice is for their own citizens.
One example is that the Americans may find themselves in situations in the Middle East different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The information is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, generalized and too simplified compared to more detailed information from elsewhere.
Dangerous weather is a common term for all dangerous weather phenomena which may cause damage, serious social disturbances or loss of life.
Hazardous weather can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, surface formation and atmospheric conditions.
Hard wind, hail, high rainfall and fires are the shape and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, cyclones, water statues and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal phenomena of hazardous weather include snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of dangerous weather affecting their destination, as this may affect travel plans.
All those who wish to visit a country that can be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
The Internet search for the term "course for hostile environments" is likely to result in an address of a local company.
The course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail and generally in combination with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications on war zones.
Tourists planning a gender improvement operation abroad should ensure that they have current documents for their return trip.
The willingness of public authorities to issue passports with no gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security inspections have also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to survive security scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Return flows are the reversible flow of the shore-breaking waves, often found in reefs or similar locations.
Due to underwater surface formation, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and there can be a rapid flow into deep water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion when trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the power, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't stay to take the power again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, it might be wise to wait for the saviors.
The return shock strikes earlier than the cultural shock (the transition phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more serious.
It is sometimes particularly difficult for tourists, who were able to adapt easily to the new culture, to adapt again to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some ways of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding when they knew that passengers needed to get used to the new country.
People do not necessarily realise that patience and understanding are also important for travellers returning home.
The Pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show begins they can be seen in full silence.
Usually you hear the voice of tourists and merchants, and the story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background to a long story and its multiplier.
The scenes are displayed against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many countries have called for the Southern Shetland Islands, which were found in 1819, and they have the largest number of bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is the island of King George, where the settlement centre of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the crater of the still functioning volcano, filled with water, acts as a huge natural port.
Ellsworthimaa is an area restricted by the Bellingshausen Sea south of the Peninsula.
The mountains of the peninsula will merge there and then rise again to form the 360 km Ellsworth mountains, which will be split in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The highest mountains of Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Mountains, the Vinson Massive, the highest peak of which is Mount Vinson in its 4,892 metres.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no reception, satellite phones can be the only option.
Satellite phones are usually not available to replace mobile phones, because to make a call you have to be outside and keep an accessible view of the satellite.

The local provider of your telephone services is likely to be able to provide further information on how to connect to the service in question.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option among those planning for the interim year.
It is particularly popular among school decision-makers, because they can take a year off before university without their education suffering.
In many cases, participation in a midyear course abroad may even improve the chances of continuing university studies in your own country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participation in these programmes.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. There are also thousands of islands in the country of thousands of lakes, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In islands and lakes you may not need a boat the size of a sail.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayak have a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there are boats for every seven or eight people.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is also very rare (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one of forty).
Most of the actual Baltic cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still go back to sleep overnight.
You do not need a separate visa if you only visit the countries on boat trips (2009 situation).
The brochures for some cruises include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so visiting the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling on an aircraft can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not previously flown or experienced something traumatic.
There is no shame in it: it is no different from many other people's own fears and hatred for some other things.
For some people, some kind of perception of the operation of the aircraft and what is happening in flight may help overcome the fear of ignorance or of feeling helpless.
Transport companies are well paid for their fast deliveries. Speed is often very important for their documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
While larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods on air cargo, then on some routes the unloading and customs could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulation does not allow the baggage to be shipped without a passenger, so at this stage you are needed.
The self-evident way to fly in the first or business class is to pay a big stick of cash for this privilege (or perhaps rather let your firm do it for you).
But it is not cheap: according to the rugged rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the business class compared to the tourist class and eleven times the price of the first class!
On direct flights from A to B, it is generally not even worth looking for discounts for business class or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has suffered from an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Republic of Transnistria in East Moldova, which has its own administration and currency, but no member of the United Nations recognises it.

The regular Metro alerts are only in Catalan, but the automatic system reports unexpected disturbances in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation as self-centered, rude and arrogant people.
Although it is often just an inappropriate stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is to be as merciful as possible and behave as someone who is "bien √©lev√©" (well-bred). It makes movement much easier.
The rude exterior of the Parisians will evaporate quickly if you show a common courtesy.
Plitvice National Park has a lot of forests, mainly beech, spruce and pine, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a considerable diversity of plant communities due to a wide range of microclimates, varying soil and peaks.

In addition to more common species, you can meet rare fauna such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and forests
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts covering their knees, and their shoulders should also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially the bright color, you might get a smile from a monk or a nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to be dressed in pants that extend beneath their knees.
They can also be borrowed from the entrance wardrobe, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorca kitchen is based on bread, vegetables and meat (in particular pork), and uses olive oil for everything, as is the case in similar Mediterranean regions.
A simple popular dinner especially in summer is pa amb was: bread with olive oil and tomato and any available side, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, plus the word "Sie," or "you," always start with a big initials, even in the middle of a sentence.

Nowadays, old-fashioned observatories are generally not used for their original purpose but have been transformed into museums or learning environments.
As light pollution was not the same problem as it is today in their days of glory, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge institutions and are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
Watching cherry flowers has been part of Japanese culture since the 1970s.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the Emperor held the first cherry flower party only for himself and for the other members of the aristocracy affected by the imperial court.
Plants look the best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to at least take a "just one" sample.

They also determine the course of popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated on the birthday of Jesus.
The non-believers and non-Christians of Christian countries around the world have also introduced many traditions of celebration.
Traditionally, Easter night is spent awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be the spring and fertility ritual before Christianity.
More traditional churches often deliver Easter Night Mass on Saturday night. The church often breaks out to celebrate at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals originally arrived on the island came in swimming, flying or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant turtle became the main grass-eating animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit an Arctic or Antarctic area in winter, you will experience a chamois, so the sun will not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see northern lights because the sky is dark almost 24 hours a day.
