Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the mailman, the police arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld in Spain, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of a court.
Yesterday the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
According to suspicion, these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation aged between 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
In Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation in the Malaga province of Mijas was detained.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of them being the leading figure of the criminal community, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected suggest that the criminal community had clearly allocated roles and roles.
The purpose of the criminal community's activities was to commit drug offences and thus to generate proceeds from crime, "commented the head of the pre-trial procedure in the criminal case, Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have also fallen into the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some of them have been penalised for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been an important element throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become common to us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialised and we held suspects in crime in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
He added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were helpful in their detention in Spain.
For years, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are another message to criminals that we will get them from another end of Europe, "said Leis.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while in freedom, suspects may continue to commit new crimes, the prosecutor's office has requested their arrest and the court has also approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is waiting to be handed over to Estonia.
In this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial procedure in the criminal case is conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for Organised Crime and managed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the City Court of Tallinn convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia, following this underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He claimed to have taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged a monthly roof tax to businessmen.
Joint international operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, eight accused persons in the so-called "Dikaev criminal case ', from whom EUR 80 000 of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or nine persons in the conviction that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Estonia and South Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds seized there is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, it has been ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, take action together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement states: "The travel sign of the NAACP issued for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the State as a whole, given the suspicious racial events of the entire race that have recently taken place and have been highlighted here. '
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and by the fact that, to an equal extent, it is minorities who are the targets of state law enforcement.
"Human civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the edge of the road because of their skin color, beaten or killed, "said NAACP Missouri Branch President Rod Chapel to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints before."
It's the first kind of warning an organization has issued about a U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas on his way through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail or informing relatives that they are passing through the state."
On the basis of the most recent data from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, placing the number of similar violations in the 16th place in the country.
Travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the search for a place of residence or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel information on Texas and Arizona following the adoption by these states of immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, as ACLU said this would increase racial profiling.
Typically, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings for other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain US internal laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C are at a low cost, which may develop further into cirrhosis of the liver, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
The Health Office's epidemiological advisor, Mr Kutsar, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last of these symptoms also comes from the popular name of the inflammation of the liver called jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may occur without signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be converted to chronic hepatitis and can go on for decades without signs of disease, which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous liver disease.
The hearing Kutsar brings out various forms of hepatitis and describes their course more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, from infected human faeces to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth and drug use.
People with chronic liver disease, people having sex with infected people, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A, are at risk of hepatitis A infection.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular by recommended vaccination for people at risk of high risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with sick people's blood, injecting drugs, tattoo, piercing, using contaminated organs (toothbrushes, shaving equipment), donor blood, sex with a person with a risk of hepatitis, and from hepatitis to the foetus / newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborn children of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B disease.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular people at risk and persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes are recommended.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoidance of the use, tattoo and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe needles, and use of condoms in cases of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattoo, piercing, using blood-contaminated substance, donor blood, having sex with a person with a risk of hepatitis, and from a hepatitis patient to the foetus / newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of infected people, men having sex with men, new-born, sick family members and carers of the infected mother, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, persons infected with HIV and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure against hepatitis C is: avoidance of use, tattoo and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and syringe needles, and use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus that is multiplying in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
This includes hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringe needles, sexual contact, and rarely infected mother to foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and non-hepatitis B immune individuals.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread through the faeces-oral route to drinking water and food, including low-heat treated meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
Prevention measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the bathroom, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid the consumption of heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although in the last round, competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, Farah, 34 years old, found strength in the final line and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long by dragging his wife Tania and the kids along after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful, "said Farah to journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title contest in London with 5,000 and 10,000 metres of gold dubels running.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, is an extraordinary story" much deeper than the birth story of one of the works of art in the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.
But even more deeply in history.
The acclaimed information package could have been used, perhaps in a harsher scabbard, for a narrower subject, to allow the extravagant story of the title to become more effective.
There are now two books between one cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer on Gustav Klimt and her painting "Lady in Gold" and a much more extensive and comprehensive history book about the Jewish families and German occupation, with its repercussions in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the abysmal cultural life of Vienna, and anyone who himself ended up in the capital of Austria can imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstrasse or how everything turned around at the Central Café when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like a gram more culturally.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city with untreated syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe seems to give nothing more to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, however, every couple-sentence brush name adds colors to the early 20th century cultural life in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth resident of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele was married to Ferdinand Bloch, the Czech sugar magnate, and he posed for his famous paintings, his father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life she belonged to didn't draw.
When you look at "Lady in gold," it's hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, the hottest painter in Vienna was the last moment.
Klimt's order at the time cost 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a good-located farmhouse.
The fact that some portraits suspected the master's love story with the model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only definite fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that arose during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa in English.
Shortly before the beginning of work with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of Rabble San Vitale, and researchers think that it was there that the brilliant mosaic of the Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting "Kiss."
Art historians didn't miss the resemblance of two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his work publicly available," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before Klimt died, Adele had another portrait.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925) he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt Landscapes at the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was handed over to her niece, Maria and Luis.
One year after Klimt had finished "The Austrian Mona Lisa," he had tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Adolf Hitler, 17 years old, but failed in drawing.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be due to the fact that he was not accepted by Jewish professors at the Academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the mission of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the will of Mary had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find the works that were acceptable to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections of Vienna.
Hitler's personal art property was matched by some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heist, a 10-year trial between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer began.
It should only be noted here that if "kiss" is seen in the castle of Belvedere in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's depicting "Lady in gold" must be seen in the Neue Gallery in New York.
And before the Vienna race, read the above-mentioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions turned around after the book was closed, more Nazi and Jewish than the painting sold for $135 million and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait as a family fate story - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree, which was presented at the beginning of the book, facilitated the orientation of events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In life, Gold was very close to his own 200 m back-swimming personal record when he swam at 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to a 17-year-old, a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championships received 2.16.58, the Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last one to make it to the A-finals.
In the finals he passed the distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful mark of excellence.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) left Gold to separate for just over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time record, Gold rose to third place, and his new personal top mark is the fifth result of all Estonian times.
The young hope for the future is still at the Canadian adult championships for 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in the free mood and 200 m and 400 m in the complex.
Last week in Toronto, the Canadian Junior Championships took place and Gold made successful start-ups there too.
He won 200 meters in the mood for a silver medal in 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was thawed by the Estonian last in 2008.
In Estonia, only Elina Parteoka, Estonia's record woman, has swam this distance faster than gold.
The Estonian girl who lives in Canada won a bronze medal in a 100 m free mood with an excellent personal record and a brand-new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has swam this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached the personal top marker by another 100 m in the back of the swimsuit and received a message in the opening of the swim time of 1.03.69.
At half the distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swam in the finals at 2: 17,31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian season table in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen his teeth.
It is time for vacations - that is also a relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the most vacationing presidents, the critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend 17 days in a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's leave began yesterday, the opponents of Trump have spoken on the issue of leave for a week.
They're giving Trump too much rest.
It is the president's custom to spend weekends in his fleece in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 terms.
For example, George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama is half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after becoming president, Trump said "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long holidays during his duties, because there is a great deal to be done.
He also expressed his resentment three years ago for Barack Obama's vacation.
The current President wrote on Twitter at that time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS cutting off the heads of journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
This is officially referred to as working leave, during which Trump has no time for reading or other activities of the mind.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
In particular, the air conditioning system will be replaced in the west wing of the White House and therefore all personnel had to leave it.
In the west wing there is also the Oval Office and other premises of the President.
"I don't think any of you would want to be on the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, speaker of the White House, who stressed that the president would continue to work during his vacation.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the National Authority if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
Of course, the criticism upset him.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom of expression may be taken away from us and, in the dark and silence, we may be led, like sheep, to slaughter."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And for the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) therefore sued him.
The governor's staff dismissed the action and web commentary was full of counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His approval rate is top two among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkable reaction head.
He has led the state with his own firm hand and has been strictly determined by his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main means of communicating with his constituents, for example by presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's page, which is a public forum with official labelling, is administered by the staff who pay taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people who visit.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behavior in the interview given to The Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than modernisation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls on the web, spammers or people full of anger.
The Post talked to several real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, the real people who communicate with their chosen leaders, the teacher, the owner of the company and the pastor, not the Internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not dirty.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, underlining Hogan's Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland, Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary section of The Post.
"I also do not like the idea that, when a lot of people comment on the same subject, someone immediately calls it an indifferent collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's official called "targeted spam attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook era allows for easy matching of messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be when employees had to be sent out to do the same, so that they could gather the newspapers with critical instructions and burn them or arrest the protestors and make them shut up.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media channels toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter.
One of the first judgments of significant importance on this subject was handed down last week in Virginia.
The US District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the representative of the Loudounn County Supervisory Board violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voters from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for Facebook and Twitter use.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal charges had the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the anonymous writers thwarted his way of running.
And even then, Washington was supposed to be in the chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, taking Washington's decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected in the context of the online George Washington letter collection project, he buried his office under petitions which criticised his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And the right direction means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort at the Renaissance Club.
The former European representative, Ronan Rafferty, hopes for the comfort of home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course.
The North American, who was leading the last round in front of the Arctic Links tracks in the neighbourhood last year before the fall to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and plays the role of tournament ambassador instead of the founder and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"Players see the track in its best form, it is in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job building this place.
He's a keen supporter of the golf game and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
This allows the track to be perfectly presented. "
England will never be interested in being able to defend the championship for the first time, even though the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 years of career.
"This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremadura Open title because it was taken from the competition calendar a year after I won.
It's magical to come back to this part of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year. For me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts. "
Gary Orr, who joined the Senior European tour at the beginning of the year when he was 50, will also return to the competition on the ground.
It is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Openi in 2013.
"Play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburg man Orr.
"You want to play well, but you can feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again so much, and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I am pleased with the way things have been going so far. "
In Trio, former Champions winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the field.
Orr and former Captain Sam Torrance of the Ryder Cup are two of the six Scots in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access is free of charge and car parking costs a car with one passenger 5 pounds and two or more cars 10 pounds.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-stricken land
If Bardina is cooking a dinner, she won't be using the stove.
He rarely even uses a pot.
In the wooden cabin in Enarotal, the central city of the Paniai Regentre of the province of Papua, Indonesia, the housewife places the sweet potato called nota in local language directly in place of fire.
In half an hour, the cooled mule will be removed from the fire and ingested with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture, and at the same time he does his daily housework, for example washing his laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The toilet role is filled by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of his husband's four wives, he is not appointed to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the village's men to be unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares visit after five o'clock at night," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the mountain country of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony, which was joined under Indonesia in 1969 after the polemics caused a referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupants' forces by raising their hands.
The movement, which incited the Dutchman regime to be freed, quickly directed its fury against the Jakarta Government, which continues to hold the region under strong control, while keeping away foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the eastern part of the island remained in Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is an equally distant and abandoned place. To get here you have to fly 90 minutes from Jayapira, the province's capital, to Nabire, and then go through the five-hour journey that makes you nauseous with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs whose rust has turned different shades into yellow brown.
Very few Indonesian people have made a journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, the papaya of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," says Degei, referring to his color-wrap hand-woven turban, a dark blouse and a bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold-rich land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, a company based in Phoenix, is located 100 km from Panama, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted approximately USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be fleshed with consumer timber stocks, estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the sufferings of the papaya, as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times 2005 study showed that Freeport paid some USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
The attempts of the coupons to ensure greater autonomy threaten the golden goose and are mercilessly retreated with them.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 papaya have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Committee on Human Rights of Asia, the mass killing in the mountainous countries of Papua tribes in the 1970s was a genocide measure.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protestors were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the Birsbane archbishop, "We will lose everything ', contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shock is particularly widespread) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to read together because such incidents occur every week," says Human Rights Watch Indonesian Detective Andreas Harsono.
The screws have been turned off even more, as Papua natural resources have caused the influx of neo-settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing because Muslim economic migrants are arriving from the peoples of Indonesia, from the islands of Java, Kalimanta, Sumatra and Sulawes.
The Japanese family cuisine sell the gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, which is served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local papaya," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Pania, who moved to Jayapiras, the capital of the province for a job.
"Indigenous papaya papaya papua papua mama-mama [women] will therefore lose their market share. '
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, known as Jokow among the people, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But there has been very little change in Papua and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokow in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says you.
In fact, only two months after Jokow took office, Paniai was in a state of destitution.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs in Enarotalia at the campfire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from the darkness.
The sick kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and returned later with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses say that drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot into the children.
One child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to the football field in front of the local police station and the military control centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and presented a waita dance of Papua mee's pago tribe, during which they ran around and copied a bird song.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
In the event of the evildoom, an order was sent to the soldiers through the internal radio. "If the mass of the people resists more than three times, shoot them down," said the official document, which has been seen in Time magazine, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
The parent of the city of Enarotal, Kego Koto, Yeremias Kayame (56), felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to Time magazine in his bright colors on the porch of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but she says the bullet came from a group of assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times by a cousin who saw him shot.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Time in the gloom of Yohanes, who, like many Indonesian people, used only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of the Papua Police told the reporters that he was only in charge of the security of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with murder," said Commissioner Pudjo Sultiyo, the press representative of the Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news about the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapura made a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
On 5 June, when Mr Jakarta spoke, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided by the law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including those in Panama.
The families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with dark misgivings.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the Paniai people are afraid to break up this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Paniai neighbouring register in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when it came to words between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to transport a unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's office on the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at the police, on which they responded with warning shots.
However, according to the locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people by killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we were afraid of revenge," said TIME 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lived near the hospital and saw the injured entering.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the responsible police officers to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development nourishes the discontent of honey, many, Dan and Damal tribes living in the pervasive middle mountain land of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) with the rebel army, which, according to them, protects the rights of the papayas by organising occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Panama, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, under the pretext of defending the "sovereignty of the state" of the army, over the last few years, the Panic has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The small rice sold in Enarotalia is too expensive for local people to buy.
The bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food themselves mainly in sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of their prey to the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous papaya and new migrants have intensified, which have been abundant since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and richer migrants.
Couples themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are still severe restrictions on external media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua, because "they did not follow the relevant practices', although they had been given a rare licence to film.
According to Mr Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asia Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to abolish the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists who are trying to report about Papua's most troubled provinces and Western Papua are threatened with new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in his statement.
The lack of a press poll means that the international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States were encouraged by Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported VPL as well.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the group's charges, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press so that evidence of human rights cases can be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, insisting that "we want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the papaya do not believe that they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokow is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai are constantly living under the threat of a predator army, they are suffering from dire education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like the other papayas, regard their voice to Jokow as a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai's shootings were still able to deal with the last symbolic resentment they buried one of the victims's bodies in a country opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set in motion, they will not at least allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a banged head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
On Friday, the fire crashed through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to escape from this height of 337 metres and a 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has ravaged the high-rise that happens to be called Torch, the Torch Tower, for only two years.
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up with a fire alarm and screaming at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor, "Reuters was told by a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai's civil protection officers, fire brigades extinguished the fire at approximately 4: 00 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to secure shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used throughout the world on the external surface of high-performance materials.
The investigation carried out by the Torch Board following the fire in 2015 found that the greatest damage was caused by facades - decorative panels and insulation on the outside.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenfell Tower and the facade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that was there in June, which killed some 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably going to be sales hits in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale in the spring, even in the autumn it will be expected to have new hits on the shops.
According to the marketing and sales director of Tele2 Kristjan Seema, today's flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an eye-iris scanner, a screen with 4K resolution from edge to edge and a super-fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 was a great inspiration in the technology world, which has also reached the top of the sales table for Estonian smartphones.
The autumn will allow even more quick loading, more durable battery, a better quality camera and greater water and dust security for smart people.
He added that rumours already suggest that you can make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to take over the sales tables today.
These four top-of-the-line models of smartphones will still reach the store in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the store by mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous one for Apple's tenth birthday.
Four colours have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone panel, a home button has been lost and a fingerprint reader has been built inside the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an eye-iris scanner, wireless loading and even better quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The new Galaxy Note 8 model starts on August 23rd.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is gonna look like.
It is said that even more business users are meant to use, and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wave angle and the other is a TV object with a narrower field of vision.
Now no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to iPhone 8.
However, we are looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has brought three smartphones to the market with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a missing flagship - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August.
We are waiting for Nokia's 5,3-inch edge-to-edge screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras manufactured by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with a camera that's as good or better.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What is happening is that we will see it very soon, because traditionally Sony has released its autumn flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the transcripts of the phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post released the United States President Donald Trump and the transcripts of telephone calls between Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On 27 January, Trump made a telephone call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, to put an end to the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States, with him, broke the wall for a public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign to build a wall and pledge to make Mexico pay for this project along the southern border of the United States.
Transcripts of his first speech with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Australia, were also published, revealing the intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement between the United States of America and the refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "lame," and "stupid." He claimed that the agreement that was made during the Obama government would make him look "stupid" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump stopped the call by informing Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP City Lines in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for bus and coach transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree rejecting the Tartu bus offer by OÜ MRP City Lines because the offer did not comply with the requirements, explained Anneli Aputin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This appropriation is intended to cover the cost of the purchase, hire, maintenance, repair and maintenance of equipment and installations for the purchase, hire, maintenance and repair of equipment and installations.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take that up.
Although in social media, many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disrupts their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken parties, there are many who have no bad words about the festival that goes on on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that at the store the parties were so polite!
I didn't see any blur or discourtesy.
Even the kindness I saw, "says the perfumed Laine.
"It's nice to be here, to be here, and to be happy with Pärnu, which is in winter as it is in winter's sleep," he adds happily.
There's no problem with the sleepless Laine's sleep on the beach.
When he lived downtown, he heard music playing on the beach, now the music hasn't reached his home.
"But I hope I hear you," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who has also spoken to the evening paper, says that the big festival is more good for Pärnu - it makes a big contribution to the turnover of local traders.
He also welcomes the fact that so many foreigners have come to the summer capital.
You don't bother the lady with the party noise.
Even though I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's revived.
And it's nice to have people moving and it's been like this three times, "says the woman.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he wondered.
But he says the noise on the beach is common to the summer capital.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is in the park.
The noise and the noise haven't hit his vitals either.
But for what?
We should all stick together.
To think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
You don't crush a man with loud music.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live near there.
"Good people can save money and there's no trouble," he says.
He says the guests who came into the house are polite.
"With the bottles, they have, of course, exaggerated a little too much, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
The people on the beach have travelled away by then, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina who walks with children in Pärnu.
His family's dream music is not disturbed either, although last year it came even further from this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of the city ourselves, that actually sounds pretty good out there by the river Pärnu, "he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business.
On Friday, Pearson, a British education firm, said that he would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce his mid-term dividends by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the hardship of business.
The jobs to be lost, according to CEO John Fallon, are likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, in addition to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third cost reduction programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed since the announcement of a 1% increase in sales revenue to GBP 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to the officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people died in Herat's mosque attack.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "human self-imprinted explosive device."
According to the statement, everyone is injured in a stable state and is being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the "Islamic State '(ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul mostly killed at least 30 people in the Shiite District.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the centre - the most fatal military attack in the country since the US-led troops were overthrown by the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the military and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA annulled the decision to postpone the wolf decree following the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Regulation, which obliges states to limit emissions causing smoke, one day after 15 states sued the Agency due to this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 ozone measurement activities" late on Wednesday, saying that it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we must engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in the statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention to postpone the ozone concentration measurements by measuring wolf pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with a stricter air quality standard.
Fifteen states, mainly democratic, brought an action together with the Columbia District on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Mr Trump, is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But these efforts have resulted in counter-reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase the risk of respiratory disease," such as asthma.
German pigs could have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party because strong rains threaten the yield of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, "Bloomberg writes.
This year, the rainfall that has lasted for weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only good for animal feed.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than it was last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeeni, analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40% of German wheat can be used as animal feed, which is twice as much as usual, was predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by the heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was struck by rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn't even started harvesting yet, reported a local crop collector in Ceravis.
"It's a difficult day," said Ceravis's senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, perhaps the clever swings of Finnish interior design.
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interior of the exhibition houses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbours' efforts to create both harsh and perfect (energy-saving) homes are beginning to emerge.
Admiralty and also respect are worthy of Finnish wood use skills as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products.
Invigorating techniques and smart solutions can be found both by the builder and (home) designer in the fair houses.
It is evident there that black, white and grey shades, when complemented by wood tones and room plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week because the fair lasts until 13 August.
Appliances and herb pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night before today, the line was drawn down to this year's Weekend Festival Baltics, and Martin Garrix gave everything he could to remember himself as the last performer.
People were really turned around at the time of Garrix's performance - singing, flute, dancing in self-esteem.
When Garrix was finished, the joint mass was poured out of Pärnu Beach on the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught in the last three days on Weekend.
I'm sure you're in one of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course to face the most attractive boxing match in the near future, met for the first time in the 66.7 kg weight category on Thursday.
They were at ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council's lightweight champion, walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the world Boxing Organization's feather champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision to win over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are among the top of the weight table.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria at 19: 00 on Saturday night at ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas stated that the possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect measurement."
"I'm a former feather," said Garcia.
"I moved up [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kg.
I want to move down to light weight.
And he has to move up to light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what the fans have wanted.
Then let us offer them this. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question as to whether it should be paid, as part of his strategy to allow Lomachenko to debut at the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match, after their weight on the platform of the championship on 23 September.
"Looking at this fight could be pay-per-view because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying that he is open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a great fighter and could go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest when he praised Garcia, saying that he thought that the three division champions from Riverside looked "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to take a nap."
Garcia said the goal was to show the punch force and then fight.
Both confirmed that they can feel the tension growing between them in order to gain strength.
"It's a fight waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and noise.
I'm more than willing to work for it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It's gonna be a good fight. "
Which corners of the world are moving to Estonia?
Last month, the Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) extended and issued record 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals, who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, when it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners last year, the number was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of the Interior.
When, ten years ago, nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year, this figure is starting to reach 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, one year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Finland, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing most in Estonia, with 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and it is natural, due to the difficult circumstances in the country, that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many of them are already ahead of the family," said Kristin Rammus, Press Officer at the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens last month, although the total number of temporary residence permits issued to them over the last ten years has been highest.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then the citizens of Russia will be home migration.
"In view of the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helena Maasing, migrant researcher at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to, then after Harjumaa there is East Virumaa," he added and pointed out that about 40% of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," said Rammus, Press Officer at the Ministry of the Interior, who said that Russian citizens' interest in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years rather.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
It aims to promote the survival of the adapted people.
A long-term resident's residence permit, however, requires, for example, five years.
As a result of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians were granted such a residence permit, who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians are now able to change jobs and the Estonian state is no longer following up on whether the pay criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular - the grey passport holders (1029), the Russians (487), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received residence permits for their residence in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese citizens.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become surprisingly a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, it was 200 years ago.
They come from Nigeria to study here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to learning migration.
For them, too, the rule is that where the community has emerged, it is easier for others to come along, "said Rammus.
For ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If you get a residence permit every year for about 6,000 third-country nationals, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we consider the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at around one per cent, "Maasing commented that in fact the figures are small.
According to Statistics Finland, 14 822 people travelled to Estonia last year, while 13 792 people travelled from here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the emigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the emigrants.
This is why the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2,000 people last year.
The Estonians are primarily travelling between Finland and Estonia.
Mampu Couture's princess fashion is charming with skates, embroidery and quarrel.
However, for Maria Tammeoru, the northeastern idea box has a history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream and admire the old sleeves and collar in a museum for hours.
If you do anything with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mampu Couture may look like a stranger to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine you have in your life!
I have a friend who's got a whole sauna full of stew couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and she doesn't go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she wears them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognise the gap between bright events and gray everyday.
It was this mindset that made the plan to move high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who often cannot get to fashion.
Mampu's collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvis and Pärnu fashion allele, where the 45-model royal defilet filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often take part, nod with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - they cry bravo, they get up, they want to thank you by hand.
A lot of the audience just came to renew, but now they're Mampu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion work.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, and it didn't look like they were gonna end!
Maria also does not admit to fashion that creations must be presented by supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring on stage ordinary women.
I often invite my own customers to the stage - they have always been happy.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, I'm always behind the stage to give the last touch to things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to watch the hall.
Maria is this kind of fashion creator who wants not only to play a role as a representative, but to be in all hands.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
I guess these hours of work are going to be huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day at work ends, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and yet there are compliments.
Many times it has been said that there is magic in my dresses - they make you feel like a princess.
The staggering staggering lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mampu Couture until today.
Martin Müntersmith of the U18 boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament's weapon has now been turned against us
Sorry, I'm out of fairy tales.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And when there is such a difference in the table, there is nothing to be done, "commented the Estonian U18 basketball boys 61: 75 below the UK's only basketball player in the NBA, BC Kalev / Cramo assistant coach Martin Münrsepp.
Opposites took 28 balls out of the attack table, and they got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, either.
Many British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
But in defense, they got to hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the team down.
The opposite's homework was better done.
According to the masonry, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take off the attack of its opponents.
On the last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Attitude and intense behavior, which was our weapon at the sub-group tournament, now turned everything against us.
Today, we had no power against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, you can say good words about the entire team, so to date there was a single punch fist.
It's too bad you haven't met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that she was tired - she's been carrying quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before, "added the instructor.
Horrible numbers: The girls' basketball team threw less than 10 points at the EM tournament...
In the U18 age group, not only a basketball tournament in Tallinn for young men in the EMI B-division took place in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, has fallen into the field of anti-record.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter it was 9: 49, or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their feet off the gas pedal and that period remained at 16: 16.
Estonia threw 4 points in the first and second quarters, 1 points in the third quarter...
The Estonians hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 of the game, then one of the three, and then 21 of the other...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 shots were caught.
In addition, two points out of four free throws came.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses in that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33 hits and Estonia had 13% (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses; on the opening day it was necessary to acknowledge the superiority of Portugal 83: 56.
NATO ships have come to Tallinn to replenish supplies.
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to complement the fleet supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
In the course of the visit, the vessels shall prepare to return to the sea and shall give crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days off.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations in the search for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their cooperation training in local waters is a good expression of our integration with the Allied Forces," said Major Arto Reinmaa, Chief of Operations and Planning, who is in charge of the Navy Fleet.
From 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st Permanent Anti-Mines Group, the Latvian Naval Lieutenant, Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group leader at the ceremony in Riga from the Estonian Naval Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias from Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is designated as the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaiti, which also operates as a group leader.
This semester, the International Unit is also composed of the Estonian Navy minehunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under the command of the NATO Maritime Command is NATO's 1st Permanent Mines Response Team, a primary rapid reaction unit that can be deployed by the Alliance within five days to different parts of the world.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where 13 years ago the Birgitta Festival, called by Maestro various Klas, will be held down.
According to this year's Birgitta Festival, the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joost (36), will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: "Traviata" and "Tosca" are in the opera world's classic, the ballroom answers from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is no lack of the own production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful orator "Years" by the same international creative team who brought Haydni to the stage in 2015 "Creation."
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose enchantment takes over and never lets go.
For the experience of the listener in this exalted and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches human perception in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maestro Different Klas shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Klaus, it's been very helpful.
He directed me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of his career as a driver.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
In a different Klas, the Birgitta Festival team has been injected with so much goodness and, of course, it's all passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of the various Klasse that gave me the strength to make good progress with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonia.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this festival that you're offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written for the story of Astrid Lindgren.
That's Karlsson flying.
And one of the criminal nuances of this ballet is the author of the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write this work.
Apparently, he's had a character named Karlsson since he was a kid.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it in a pile.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as I do on myself, how I go against every new day.
And such conscious tone-holding, positivity-holding, and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have been particularly busy practising it and it works.
Smiling itself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them yet, but I think everyone will discover it gradually.
Now, this is a big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step on the conductor's remote?
Yes, it is. You have to change your clothes for the more comfortable ones.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before stepping into the drive.
But everyone come to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Look at the mood video with Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asyl applicants to evaluate their age with a new approach medically. The latest results show that more than 80% of the tested subjects were assessed as older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up to assess the age more precisely during the application for asylum following criticism by the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) that they have failed to correctly determine the age of a number of alleged minors.
At present, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and 25 further cases were assessed by the Institute of Forensics as being "likely to be 18 years of age or older '.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18 '.
The test shall be used only if the age of the person is under the mark of question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensics, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he said to the local newspaper.
The fact that a large number of cases were assessed as older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that 442 cases "there are indications that the subject is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed by a person that he would be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which makes X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, then allows dentists and radiologists to analyse them, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is Mr Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't be sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can, "he said to Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensics defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurately disenfranchising the child is low.
The highest, or at about 10%, is the risk when a person is just under 18. "

The 20-year-old hammer-thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the World Cup in London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MM's youngest female hammer shooter and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average score, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, "said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's World Cup debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rain didn't interfere with Orel, because he trains winter through the TT Stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympics had almost a full house full of people, did Orel sense people around him, or was he able to shut himself down?
I got it, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it gives you more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would be satisfied with the World Cup's debut and that he would still have many good races: "I came here with the 32nd result of this season, I finished at 18.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMI is the only thing that matters.
I take with me a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
The governor of West Virginia reported a party change.
Western Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting on Thursday evening with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought hard... today I say to you, the West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the rally, the cheering started.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a great announcement earlier at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes points out that he owns coal mines in five states and owns a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's exchange of parties is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from becoming better again rather than working for it."
"Only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is unled from the top and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said RNC spokesperson Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise there's a lot of people down there, too.
The Urmet in Weekend's medical tent told the evening paper yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
The wild and the bruises are the basic, out-twists and slight falls.
Of course, headaches, back pains and leg pains.
Urmeti says that visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's how problems come.
The doctors have also had to assist a few visitors with greater injuries - there have been a few panic attacks and also a break in the leg.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the parties are asking the doctors for a painkiller to treat the hangover.
Coe praised the Russian honest apology for the doping scandal.
According to him, Sebastian Coe, the international sinner of the Light Power, praised the "Thursday honest Russian apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to let the country back into sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian lightweight sinner, said at the IAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships, that the ban on competition imposed on his country was correct and had a firm aim to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the lightweight kids who have received gold and silver medals from the races."
In spite of his comments, the IAEA Congress voted in favour of maintaining the anti-competitive ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said President Coe of the IAEA to journalists.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance itself acknowledged that they have had quite a difficult time and that they are doing everything possible to restructure the Alliance."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that now is not the right time to take Russia back," said Coe.
"We need to do everything possible to normalise the situation in the next few months.
We have always followed the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the damaged system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweight gymnastics, which meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes in the World Championships on Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of recovery criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAF Council, he stated to journalists in London that doping controls were still insufficient and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
The fact that the revolution in electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and from the other they lose, smaller mining companies will not be helped.
Now Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future, in the age of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the UK, French and Norwegian governments' decisions to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels have increased their contributions to the distribution of electric cars.
This is why Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars are already sold for more than two decades than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"For some metals, this changes everything," said Simona Gambranin Bloomberg, raw material analyst at Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been growing for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in conventional cars, reported by Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about 5% by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore benefits from the increasing trend of electric cars from the increase in copper prices and from being the largest cobalt producer in the world, predicted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the cave's price has been on the London Metal Exchange.
The price increase was 37 per cent in the month.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20% in London, after exceeding the rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America.
On the losing side, there are companies like Recyclex and Campline that have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is the power supply of petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Metal Market Analyst.
The price movement of lead does not yet indicate the impact of the trend unwinding.
The lead has risen by 17 per cent this year, with it being the best metal from the price increase among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will not see the problems of metal until far in the future.
"I am not sure that this is so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of Triland Metals, a metalworking company.
If the lead demand falls, it will be slow.
Maybe this will happen in about ten years.
Until then, however, stricter exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries when engines are started frequently, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel because a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum minimum minimum demand of 1,6 million tonnes from 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7% of the total production of aluminium in the world.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminum has risen by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel in order to resist the lower minimum.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal diesel-powered cars were catalysts, reported by a metal refiner named Johnson Matthey.
"Many raw materials currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers over a 10-year period is that Toyota Motori and Hyundai Motos have developed hydrogen cells based on cars that depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers took a major setback in July because the Stuttgart Court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and the Porsche hometown.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world-record transition from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that holds the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still waiting.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) solely for the purchase of a Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar's salary starts to amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transition to the Neymar French club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to use this money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star block, given that the team is funded by the family of Katari's energy crusher.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in the football business.
FFP was set up by Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fail in their search for success in large debts are actually engaged in fraud and risk destruction if banks or owners should give up support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses rather than on the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - buy a club with potential and then spend a lot of money to make the team better and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
In the present three-year assessment period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini's disgraced rejection of the presidency in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said The Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who is the supervisor of FFP in UEFA last week.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar takeover clause in the form of a single lump sum, they are able to divide that amount into instalments for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, which makes it possible to demonstrate the transitional fee for the next five years in the form of an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
In 2014, in the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, received the most severe sanctions against Manchester City.
PSG was fined EUR 60 million (currently USD 82 million), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Champions League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to trick regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through club owners' companies.
Although the company of Qatar may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was blown up.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Qatar through payments from the Board of the 2022 World Cup.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become the champion of the world and claim that the UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition with PSG in a proactive manner.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made more than EUR 10 million in turnover over the 2015-2016 season.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, being clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was thus in breach of FFP.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said Mr Tebas, President of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, indicating that PSG is primarily owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares with La Liga the view that the state is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play because the country may have other ways or interests to represent the country by such a large player. "

Today 50 years ago: Hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore the roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which, on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage, particularly to Läänemaa, Harju and Raplamaa.
In the north-west of Estonia, the wind was over 30 m / s during these days.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and raging, like the end of the world.
In 2002, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu reminded the magazine Estonian Nature in an interview.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what are you going to support with your hands, where do you get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, the windows sprinkled the water in, "said Mrs Linda, who lived on the Kalda street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the train station's platform had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda only saw most of the sharks the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were down in the locus, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees like a rag and a prawn.
In August 1967, Western Virumaa was not able to suffer very badly in the storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was great there too, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padis Park were wiped from the ground, but our parks in the area were also severely affected.
In Tallinn the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of August 6, in Tallinn, a little girl was calling out, "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down any more! "wrote Virumaa's journal.
The Palli Manor building in Viljandi land was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to demolish it later.
The August storm was not able to withstand the structures of the Türi ski jumping mountain, which were no longer restored later.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and branches of trees is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the cleaning.
The crop fields were also hit hard in the storm, and the newspaper stated that "party start-ups must be both stimulating and guiding for harvesting."
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m / s.
The record of pure wind in Estonia is maintained from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m / s.
In the island of Vaindloo, the meter broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor coastal weather
The colder summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort on the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there is nothing, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people," says the cleaning lady on the beach.
On the beach of the Strom in Northern Tallinn, the gulls scream.
They are offered a melodic competition by a rocking tractor on low turns, which falls off the stripes of the plate.
In fact, the latter is sifting through the sand at seven centimeters deep, picking up marine debris and the scrap of human waste: stoppers, cigarettes and so on.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is beautiful, people are on the beach, and if they are not, there are no people, "says Aleksandr Usov, President of Haabersti Administration.
It's 6: 30 in the morning, and there's a lot of work to do on the beach, because at 8: 00, the place has to be okay for people.
Usov's at work at 4: 00.
Apart from Strom, he's still watching Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and the Pääjasaari Pikakari.
Landfill has decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
They're already holding what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the biggest jobs on the Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter washed ashore.
For example, 400 000 tonnes must be carried on the Pirita beach for the coastal season.
"This is an incredible amount," Usov points out.
The second major category is municipal waste, that is, all that people leave behind.
There are eight large waste containers on a 50-mile strom coast that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage comes in.
However, colder summer worlds have meant that the garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned.
Most of the time, they're children's toys.
By this time, Usov has shoved out of the sand a dozen model cars.
They wait for the owners to take them to the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but this is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that he will soon find them in the sand again.
The kids come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Dispose of trash
Erika Scholler, the representative of Haaberst's administrative services, acknowledges that the screening of the tractor is disrupting the local population.
Noise that lasts until early in the morning from night-time hours interferes with the dreams of people living next door.
In the day, however, this work is impossible.
One month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
However, like Pirita, Pikakaru and Pärnu, the aim is to get the Stroom beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more earl and rocks and harder to sift.
However, there is less waste on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When we hear that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the Strom beach, goes unforcibly into the conversation of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture all over the place in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags upside down, "Martin says.
Although it is difficult to expect people to be able to change their behaviour to date, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage cans and put covers on them, for example, to at least prevent the birds from reforming there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroom beach.
You can see that the city will take care of it.
It has become more pleasant with fields of children, enlightened and freshly asphalt roads.
There was a time when roller skates could only be driven one way, "Martin notes.
Findings of the treasure hunter in Stroom: coins, coins only
A 40-year-old Dimitri has had to take advantage of this morning's tide period, who, as a treasure hunter, is scouring the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he's gonna find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri says.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throw in the trash.
Usually there are coins.
"There is no gold, no rings, no such thing," said the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain at the same level as in the past, as weak economic growth and easing inflation have softened speculation over the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain weak as households' tight incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy-makers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the 6: 2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would remain, as inflation would still be expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in the rates will be necessary in the next few years to contain inflation caused by Brexit and that a higher than expected increase in borrowing costs may be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will close a fixed-term funding scheme offering low-cost financing to banks, although it said that it is now expected that GBP 15 billion will be increased under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank states: "In the MPC's medium forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain inprosperous in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household income will continue to have an impact on consumption '.
As regards the rates, it was reiterated that, in order to mitigate inflation, "some pressure on monetary policy" and "somewhat higher" are needed to alleviate inflation than is expected on the markets.
The stock exchange currently forecasts the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jump was gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The forecast of 1.8% growth in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the GBP / dollar / euro exchange rate fell.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of rising GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to pick up some momentum.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to welcome households suffering from rising inflation and low wages, saying that the situation would get worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent an income shock in the next few years, but a marked return in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also stimulates the economy by increasing demand for British production, which partly compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision comes a year after the rates were set at 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to completely blow life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers called for a 0.5% increase in the rate.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to a weak pound.
Mr Montlake, the head of the mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more competitive once again, as lenders want work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed because refinancing, often without a service fee and at a low rate, has become more and more popular. "
NHS is writing out 10 000 people with a controversial HIV drug
Since September, patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that during the initial three-year clinical trial it is now estimated that 10 000 people will receive pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a tablet that is given prior to intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the appeal court supported the Supreme Court's decision last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution's own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this exercise announced on Thursday as a "new extensive intervention," while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "turning moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the programme is launched everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking preEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicines may be taken daily or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-infected partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and enhance the comprehensive and ever more successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight for more than three decades against one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah Gold, the CEO of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the UK HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England will have access to a powerful new tool, individually managed and independent of negotiations with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly. "
The CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, Ian Green, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly launched across the country and that no member of the HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been acquired, we are on our way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
The Deputy Minister for Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to the prevention of HIV and to the end of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PreEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society. "
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while electricity prices fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the price of electricity for the next day's stock exchange between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36,27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price for the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved from Estonia to Finland for 75 per cent of the previous month's hours and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99% of the time and 73% of the hours had all transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the electricity exchange price may amount to approximately EUR 34 per megawatt hour in August and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affected the electricity production price, rose last month and transactions took place between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne.
High-rise living - half floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earth Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded her big home at Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold her apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with an ex-partner in Knightsbridge on much larger ground," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. "
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renewal course.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, "he said.
He hired Duck & Shed from an architectural and design studio in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill to take advantage of 3,8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to approach the matter in a creative way.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were located on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and the lower rooms was correct. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the window of Retrouvius, the left-handed copper light opens to the glamorous living room under the view.
Golden furniture with mirror surfaces, silver details and a retro-scented Serge Mouille luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricity, space and light abundance.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the rear mirror makes it look like another window opening in the room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne's cutlery and glass dishes.
In the living room, the charm is added to the possibility of closing the kitchen part if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that this is a garage-type lifting door.
"A little bit of design work went into it," Erfan explains the door to the MDF, which is spooned with steel gevs.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," Erfan says.
"Real estate broker enters an outdated form of room and calculates based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface using high quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home," Erfan says.
"You will not fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring. "
This shows that good design and increased surface area help to make a pretty normal apartment something amazing.
In fact, they might be a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
The only thing that matters is the amount of money you earn, and then you forget all the ethics.
His wife and three children only see him early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is the version of the business world of the Guard House - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
As the film continues, the less the frame house element remains, and the moralizing intent of the filmmakers is becoming increasingly apparent.
As a life-changing experience, the main character becomes cancer of his son's illness.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son who dreams of an architect's office makes his father walk to the big Chicago buildings to think about things that are really important, such as faith, goodness, love... not even a two-tower disaster will be untouched.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry, because even a spectator with the heaviest heart can't hold back tears when he sees the suffering of a cute cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now I'm betting on myself -- if the movie has happy itself, then I'll reward my perseverance after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, you can praise the writer for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm gonna lose my coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he storms down the hall to the room.
But the son has recovered wonderfully, and even though his father has just lost his job, that will prove positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well-designed, all the elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure that movie will bring it in.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually handle it.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a smoother water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawson:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first working day, he pointed out the key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to resolve when bad information came into the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if she were given good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried, too, and they have failed to control Trump's media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits are nowhere to be found.
"When nominee Trump was angry about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the affected publications," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "According to six former campaign workers, Trump's key to controlling Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a song of praise."
All right.
But the idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know that Trump's tweezers would have been even more flammable without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweezers Trump didn't post.
If his associates were able to get him out of trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the progress of the whole story, wrote in May about the willingness of the advisers to provide the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by the reporter Shane Goldmaker is as follows:
"The current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to a negative press, especially those with adverse effects, explosively by obsessing over the identification of their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a pristine copy of the article of the Internet Provost Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, which accused Katie Walsh, Deputy Chief of Staff, of being the "source of several leaflets' of the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mockery, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has taken them back.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and Rob Porter, Head of the White House Office, have "tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll turn out to be a more efficient leader from Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive and his helpers are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don't want to get permission to perform.
A lot of foreigners go to the center of Tallinn.
The people with whom the Night's Fairy came forward admitted to playing in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
First we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians with the rags and broken clothes were backpacks that could use a shower.
Despite his appearance, the only woman in the society played a song with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man next to him juggled three balls and invited the passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of the backbags and smoked a piece of ready-made jigsaw in his heart.
These three dogs didn't let the passing crowd get to them.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noemi and the balls, said he was doing music on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's presence was to collect ticket money for a ship flying to Finland on the same day.
The question is, did they ask permission from the city for music in the old town, shook Noemi and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the time, we get permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for that, "said Bob.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians' house and driving them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Centre to feel good.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet, and the third one had carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio of the pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said by kidding.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try, "he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds for EUR 149 million in July in the framework of the euro area central banks' public sector asset purchase programme, while the central bank's bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank shall not disclose more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to a discussion by the members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase plan comprises three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, covered bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest elsewhere.
The effect of the purchases will lead to lower-risk asset yields and will encourage investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, within the framework of a public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, while other countries' bonds are not purchased.
In the absence of bonds issued by the Estonian State, the Bank of Estonia will make a so-called replacement purchase within the amount allocated to them.
The central banks also make replacement purchases in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from the European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime Elering's bonds were also purchased, but as of June 2016, the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering's bonds.
Since June, both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds will be purchased by the Finnish Central Bank on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the most prosperous homeowners in the West Midlands have again faced a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug by the council to win back the field away from their wool.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field near the rich "millionaire district" christened Solihulli Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks since they were kicked out of May without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot on the defensive line, squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked section left behind in the footpath.
Angry residents have cursed the Solihulli Council, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers.
The council must be ashamed to get them to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably more today. "
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying the total tax if the council can't even stop this kind of thing. "
One local citizen who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous. We only just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there is a new attack.
This time the number has increased and the grass has even seen a horse rotting. "
The representative of the Solihulli Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the country near the Streetsbrook road, and we are cooperating with the Solihulli Police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. "
The Weekend Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that the world's top names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar says that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the three days of the festival.
But he will admit that the real people who have done their business have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists who have been able to bring home to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre - which is often not happening around us -" says the Minister of Culture.
What are the artists at the festival, but Saart speaks most of all?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buren, who came up last night.
After all, according to his record rotation, at some point all of us have turned our own feet, "he says.
But he'll bring up a number of other names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers: starting with NOÑP, and they can be read a whole row.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high, "he says.
Take a closer look at the evening paper video!
Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it offers software upgrade for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than travel restrictions', referring to European cities, including the BMW hometown Munich, which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced the renewal of three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers in Europe and the United States have enthusiastically promoted the use of diesel vehicles to help comply with the CO2 emission regulations.
However, nitric oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies is increasing, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harming powerful car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Businesses are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called fraud devices, which enabled the emission readings to be adjusted to the regulations during the car testing, but they withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audit of installing the system in order to circumvent European emission requirements, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generating a disproportionate proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
EU flags will be purchased for EUR 20 000 for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for the Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimeters will be allocated to 570 educational establishments of the European Union flag.
Tickets are designed to be displayed in indoor spaces, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in indoor spaces with tunnel fastening, provided by the ERR News Portal.
The label on the flagpole contains the following text: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is EUR 20 000 at the price of the Ministry of Education, which means that one ticket costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing threat situation in Mexico.
The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the state of Sinaloa's most recent chaos, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two parents' writers will discuss which one seems safer: whether to bring the children with them to an office that was the target of the grenade attack in 2009 or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room: "enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters to provide every column name without need for evidence, enough impressions and internal feelings.
There is a suspicion that drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are on the payroll of government or cartels, a whole list of bad people who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There are no breaths of violence and the more dead bodies are piling up across the country, the majority of them according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, are at least 25. 589 journalists have been killed in seven states since the election of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012.
The latest deaths include their editor and inspiration source, Riodoce's co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be perceived throughout the Riodoce building façade, with a large picture of the middle finger-pointing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts with his smiling face or his typical panamaphoe.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been brought to trial.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely get to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the murderers, the security meeting is not much good for Ibarra.
"It's really stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as you don't know why, you're mistrusting everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan, state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times.
A man with a gun drove off in Valdez's car and crashed near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left her wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, the subject of Valdez is mainly governed by silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the release to the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields, because rival clicks are fighting to fill the vacuum of power.
No matter how many people are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or how many people are killed, or how the graveyard is ploughed with plentiful, double-decorated, drug kings' mausoleum, which are bigger than the homes of many living people.
Let us forget for a moment that peace time indicates how valuable ports and drug routes to the United States are managed by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the risks involved in his work, Riodoce, the co-founder and manager of Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the nose man Damascus Lopez of a cartel that competes with Guzman's sons and is on the warpath.
This piece of paper might have pissed off the boys, suspected gang members bought all the copies of the edition as soon as they got to the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid on another newspaper activity that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always exist.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa it was "impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gained recognition with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to publish powerful studies without censorship fear and readers in a enchanted print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Committee of Journalists (CoR) for his courage to follow the Mexican drug colony wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said by accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of being a journalist, which is another way to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on. "
The Riodoce Collector misses Valdez, a joker who slandered like a sailor, a friend who generously shared arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They were relying on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has also made them question how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you messing with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-preservation even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay back.
According to Riodoce's editor, Andres Villarroal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened with Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to the toxic association of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
Landscape changes all the time.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two officers were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat under the shadow of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters were wondering if these officers were among the 50% police officers whom the governor himself has denounced as unreliable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountainous areas where de facto drug gangs have control.
Riodoce's edition of this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so we had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a favourite place for both drug dealers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician in power in the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread corruption in the context of cases.
The Villarera asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, bearing the nickname El Chapo, got out of the military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarroal, whose tenacious body construction has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have been cut off by our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and editorial workers have become something they never expected activists to do in the name of the press.
The reporter, Miriam Ramirez, grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office next morning for a protest about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
The body was found burned, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are criticising the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest against walkways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, when he met the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the reflection of government activities, worrying that hatred had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "restricted" by organised crime, fellow civil servants and an indifferent society.
In his last paper "Drug Press," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who are involved in organised crime.
The Media Monitoring Group, Article 19, allocated more than half of the press attacks last year to the police and public officials.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to silence you," said Ramirez.
The murders clearly seem to be a metaphor.
Nobody forgets the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, saying, "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his decapitated head was a computer laptop and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke of drug cartels publicly on the front cover with a "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled home countries or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to hide the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're being chased, as probably happened with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in one of Mexico's apartments in 2015 three months after he escaped Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work need to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that he is intimidated by the coverage of drug trafficking.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked down, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and raided the beer when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In Mazatlan, a resort town on the beach, 19 people were killed by confirmed reports of gunfire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of messages from cartels found in the region.
From that very edge of the sidewalk, reporters set up a new mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens flushed past another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez was leaning toward the officers on watch to see if they were on alert.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff carried out his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing down," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though pretty scary.
Scientists have now made public the first findings in relation to the incredible rhinoceros being discovered by the Canadian miner, so well preserved that it has been described by experts as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with its armor was reddish brown and its past had been somewhat "complicated."
The report published in Current Biology described the entity as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur input in the world."
Fossil is a new nodosaurus species that lived in the middle of the critical age, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival struck scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."
This armoured vegetarian is best preserved by the type of fossil that has ever been found in National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mines in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't look like the surrounding stone, and decided to look into it.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The following six years were worked on digging an animal out of 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you squat a little bit, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author Caleb Brown, the scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is displayed.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When examining his skin, scientists found that this vegetarian, though covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be exposed to significant meat-eating dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used a red and white colour to hide from predators, and applied an eclipse technique called countereclipse, which is also used by many animals today.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the environment and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus family creature first made news in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it Borealopelta, according to Mark Mitchell, the laboratory at the Markmitchell Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours on demanding disclosure of the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclipse, a method of protection common to the animal kingdom, which means that the top side of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the counter-eclipse is widespread, the findings come as a surprise because Borealopelta is much larger than animals currently living in the counter-eclipse.
It suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most modern animals - deer, zebras or armadillo - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a huge dinosaur covered with massive armour shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age could be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved contents of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when he died, reaching the sea, where he sank his back to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans probably went far inland as they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved armored skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the chalk age.
To rebuild it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's enough just to squint your eyes and it seems like he's sleeping. "
The critical age was the time when the vast dinosaurs on two legs, terosaur, were wandering the Earth.
Although all of these King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of his frightening predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 metres) long and weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The entity was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and it is a complete cone up to the hips.
These beings were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch stalks came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore was adventuring through the current Western Canada until the flooded river flushed into its open sea.
But the underwater burial site of the dinosaur helped to maintain its armour in excellent detail.
The statified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that mute scales along the dinosaur skull are still covered by the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The stony skin remains still cover the mute scales on the skull of the animal.
The right foot lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
How did one of the activists find the answer to "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just the day after travel to New York, this St. Louis resident, through Airbnb, sat in a rented room on the bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He ended up on a post with his former school partner.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Seamless @ TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly distributed along his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area sent a real-time note to Michael Brown, unarmed to the death of an 18-year-old black man killed by a white cop in Ferguson Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's inanimate body lying on the street staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later this evening he saw another provision that reported people gathering at Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of the police bird and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the sign "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was looking at a real-time flow where a cop stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop, he said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and we could call it typical."
I felt scared at the time.
I was angry and I cried. "
He booked a flight back and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11: 00, he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them were going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets" (whose streets?), which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of those who live in this community and who filled the streets in demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a flower dress and a crown suitable for it, went to Ferguson, they once again talked about the subject that had come to their attention several times before this morning, about the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he reminds me of asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him away," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time know the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel like I would do him a bear favor if I protected him from this world. "
The first stop they made when they got to Ferguson was on their way to South Florissant - a place across the road from the police station, which had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch meals.
They put food bags together and helped to distribute them to the protestors.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Alliance of Minorities Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
It all just worked out. "
A week later, Ferrell met a film director, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrell had the question: "Are you trying to document what's going on, or are you trying to find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was due to the countless number of cases where people - often white people - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and stamina.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already put his hands on co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the area who was known for his activism in relation to prisoners of death.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and the other six locals, who were watched by the "Whose Streets" team years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"For me, it was important how these people are portrayed, because that's how they're portrayed me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not "a redeemer's guide, but a community reunion," as Mr Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets" is surprisingly documenting personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt as if I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the linen.
"But I realized that doing this job and humping black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story highlights and puts the role of a black homosexual woman at the heart of the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who made up the theme reference # BlackLivesMatter after the murder of Black Teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 in social media are homosexual.
"In a leading role, black homosexual women have generally maintained movement," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he claims that "it is not a kind of thing to create equal opportunities' - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was located directly on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living at such nodes, there is much at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the region he calls home, just as a "huge boon."
However, he still attaches great importance to the mantra that he has devoured since he entered the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
7 tricks to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest male sons find after a drink-rich party that helps, too.
Or they say, "Avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a healthy, healthy one.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend rally - or any other party - and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink water.
For alcohol down and down, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Because your body loses a lot of fluid when you drink alcohol, you have to get it back somehow.
With water, mineral substances are also washed out of the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a drink, it is especially good to have a bubble-free or just slightly agitated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure a hangover wouldn't go to Grandma's house to break the trees - it could prove a fatal lie.
But an easy walk will help the body remember what it's like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way of getting well.
Give the body back the energy gradually and carefully.
If you're already starting to throw up from last night's overdrink, it's definitely not worth trying to get a big fat steak loaded into your stomach.
Start with, for example, the fresh juice containing the fruit sugars that are located quietly in your body.
If health is already suffering around noon, you might want to try a broth.
And a little later on, the back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last of the water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent hangover in the evening, your liver will have to treat not only alcohol but also paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
That way, you'll ruin your liver even more, and in the future, hangovers will be worse.
Plus, the painkiller won't stay in your body much longer anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach, it'll upset your stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along well with yourself.
It's kind of like walking, but you don't get an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid excessive activity and crazy postures - physical effort should be moderate during the hangover.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talk to your friends-sympathies, make simple fools and laugh friendly about yourself and others (suffering).
Joke and laugh may not make a hangover, but I'm sure it'll be more fun to put up with after-effects.
One day, the hangover will pass anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in the murder.
According to the police, there is a nationwide search for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who has become suspects since the discovery of the body of a man with fatal stab wounds in one of Chicago's luxury apartments.
According to Cook County court records, arrest orders were issued on Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren accused of first-degree murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, a 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police got a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds on her body when she arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to the officials, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the investigators considered the stabbing to be a murder while the police were actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations of the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been suspended from work and has been banned from entering Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail-sent statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to assist US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, it stated in the application that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communications at the Chicago Police Department, strongly recommends that suspects turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they're staying, but we're working on a more intensive definition of the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, suspects are being sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police got a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police descriptions, it was a grotesque sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren are in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," added Guglielmi.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the people: "The police are currently working on identifying the chronology of events and the background of the victim and investigating various motives, including the possibility that this was a family affair."
Idua companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of her employees in her e-commerce startup company, but the interviews were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company operating in San Francisco with 75 employees, Madison Reed.
So he called for help from external personnel.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, which is designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to carry out sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to pass the level C managers and directly address the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City, the start-up company Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, he has had a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to surveys and surveys for specific teams, it provides a company heat map which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Businesses are beginning to understand that they need to stay informed about their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped up in scandals since a blog post was published by a former employee describing the harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance can be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
In Denver, a start-up company, Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed an increase in interest and activity in the context of Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glintk, Convercent allows companies to send tailored impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and look at heat maps in problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been taken over by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Conversent.
Mr Quinlan said that if a company were found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, the departure of workers and cases, even if the regulatory authorities did not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations, has used Converent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday General Adviser James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercenter, however, there are possible problems, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not reach earlier leaders who were active in other cities or states' offices, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I can get closer to the workers' holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Mr Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after Arthur Andersen, an audit firm, collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media became mature" did companies realise that they could not prevent their black laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by taking periodic fees from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both start-ups.
In February, Conversent was financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to $47 million.
In November, Glint invested 10 million dollars in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise given the links between companies, culture and risk capital.
More and more research shows that today's workers expect more from their jobs than before.
Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley have high wages and interesting projects just on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel they are being listened to and the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General Benefits and Workers' Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Conversent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow workers to increase their commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they find support.
Data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in work culture.
However, these data will be useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything about them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can give rise to expectations that there will be changes.
And if the changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointment and a reduction in employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4000 proposals, you must be prepared for 4000 interviews," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't end, the workers will think," Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from workers disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
However, new data on workers are being collected in Ruby Tuesday and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, which is known for its large labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses. "
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
There is a low debt burden behind success, rapidly improving institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
"The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita in purchasing power is significantly closer to the EU average," said the Central Bank.
Although the objective is to equalise gross domestic product per capita with a richer Western Europe, in 2015, the Baltic economies represented only 2 / 3 of the 15 average countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek a better salary abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those questioned thought this about their economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily exercises makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when a bunch of UCLA football players stop for a conversation at the edge of a new practice field in the campus of the team.
Some of them have shaved their shirts, exposing their first day of training camp's efforts to a sweaty back.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes are a midday break.
Players attending summer courses will go back after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. next morning.
"The next three days will be a real test for them," said Coach Jim Mora of Bruins shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily training sessions to reduce the stress of players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three exercises were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit into the players' already tight schedule.
The transition from two exercises per day will mean more than one workout day - the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared to the previous season, and for the first time during Mora's six Westwood seasons, training will take place during summer courses.
Until 20 August, they are planning 18 exercises before formal preparation for the opening game against Texas A & M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change in the NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and that is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this ordeal; they will strive, they will be good young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice. "
Once the camp is over, UCLA will shut down the training, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of the parking lot close to their fields and the adjacent Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by football trails passing through the protective net around the gate post.
Since this weekend, the Bruins hotel is occupied by players, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with free rooms during the season.
"Let's take security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not overstated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a recording of your training, it might make a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use a security team over there and on the 8th parking lot.
Let's do the best we can by using what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place. "
For revenge, the Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Union, Kristina Ojuland, who was born to the Centre Party, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljus, who was created by the reunification of the forces of the Rock, and our Tallinn and the Tallinn Party to show hope to the electorate of businessmen in Action - it seems that the electoral union created on the initiative of those who have been scorched in party politics is taking part in local elections this year at least as much as it is in political parties.
However, chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaare?
When the support staff of Edgar Savisaare has become small, you can imagine events organised in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the Parliament, some former and current middlemen and many unknown faces - will that be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some loyal followers and friends of Savisaare are avoiding running for office in Tallinn be sought by the fact that the "Savaisaare List" of the perpetrators, led by the corrupt and suspected perpetrators of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city hall for the Russian pop song, in which the parent of the city district of Lasnamäe participates; and in all respects, the primitive computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, on his bike, must avoid the running of wallets and squirrels - is that how the Central City seeks the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to join the ballot boxes for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other parties see as a youth-like election campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, Channel 2 or TV3 sees a black square as opposed to the entertainment programme, there are two options: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and France24 channels can be seen in free circulation, or to surrender each month to a television operator in ten.
There are probably also those who, at first, welcome the free television experience, but at the end of the day - albeit reluctantly - pay for television pictures and advertisements.
Ear-locking music, noisy people and junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the noise, you should go home and find your country instead of hurting your head, and leave the place to the festival guests for a hefty amount of money.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said there is going to be a new US immigration plan that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill goes to the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it will change the way in which the US issues green cards to citizens from other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the funds to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, according to the media publications of the United States of America.
The young people of the Siberian Seto are moving to the city, the pensioners are returning to the country.
Evseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous gold miners of the ancient river of Mana.
He works 140 kilometers from home on the side of the Mana tributary Kuvai as a gold gardener.
This is hard work: two months in a row without rest days 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and back again.
For three years, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There is a tough order: when you go in, you make sure you don't bring vodka, and when you go out, you don't take gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho talking to local seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved arctic culture of Siberian setups is also beginning to affect home setups, because it is simply so amazing, thinks Piho Mare, who studied the most far-off setups.
His first trip to Siberia will last 30 years.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers still traveled to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out by the men in the Siberian Seto, who have been thinking about it.
It's hard to say exactly because there could be up to 30 people in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but she had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was several times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
You had to educate it, manage it somehow.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas not only related to agriculture but also to the river (swarm), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peters many settings later went to work in the classified city Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the sets constitute the majority of the population in this region at that time?
Yeah, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and being a child remained long.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How different was the culture of Siberian setups and different from that of motherland setups?
They're different, though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They made themselves (folk clothes), but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on traditional sediment clothing, because it is colder here.
Food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but here it was frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberia Setos and what life lives there? / Graphics: Alari Paloots
The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered to be very important.
It seems to me that now it's starting to give Setumaa back there, to influence them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to the village of Haida at the beginning of July to the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in homes for four days - J.P.
What's left of it is amazing.
"The slaughter is easy to come and also to leave, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm from Tapala.
The city is not just a military capital for a long time now, we have lots of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is a top-top city!
There's a small island by the White River that runs through the city where the slaughter boys tend to have a juniper party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," says Reigo.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the river side you can have a picnic and just do romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think ahead and back of life.
I've been walking with my girlfriends there, too.
Tamm has gone to the river bank between the three bridges to train his arches: "Since this place is by the city, no one may return when I hum their stories."
"The pine mountain has a wonderful view of Tapale, but there are also health courses where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, play discgolf - the golf course is done, the discs can be rented from the sports center," says Reigo.
The old pros go there, of course, with their disks, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
I guess I should invite my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale to visit because he's an experienced discgolfer and he has disks.
I think he's borrowing me!
Reigo and Pännikumägi were inseparable from the days of the current opera player's childhood.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears left on this mountain, many disappointments, and you can be in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sled and skis.
"The entire city is now full of construction works, all of which is becoming unknown," says Reigo.
Kill the old and tired vaxal building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer solutions.
I'm glad that in 2012, Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.M, accepted my idea and came to a summer theater with his theater.
Although this year's theatre season "Alexei Karenin" has just passed, on August 11, the railway station has "Awakening" as the old wagon building moves around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the City of Tapa is a day in which home cafes have been opened up in the vaaksa building and there are a series of cultural events, including popular events," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city in those days since 91.
The museum is already in a small yellow cabin on May 1, 1994.
"The house is small, but there are very many exponents and vast amounts of information," Reigo praises a place full of the City of Kill history, most of which focuses on railway and war.
Reigo says that if Tahal goes through all the recommended places, his stomach will be empty for a long time, but luckily, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sometimes when we sit in cafes, you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
The educated and young soldiers who have come to Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there, it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international society around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of movement!
In Greece, two Bulgarian people were arrested for illegal camping.
The television channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which announced that two Bulgarian people were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in the Sichonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarian people.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation going on.
The State Department told BTV that the Bulgarian people were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught resting in a place which is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves teach puppies to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers will have to give "teaching material" from their herd once again to the wolves after the break of the year - the wolves who probably taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
There are also data from the Environmental Agency that the wolf nest was not born in Hiiumaa last year and the information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that this year two wolf litter sites have been fixed on the island.
In the night until Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste, and injured half of 18 of the surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselia and badly injured one of you who had to be hit by an emergency.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law amending the Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
The amendment to the law renounces the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, which will be the subject of a plant health register.
In addition, GM will change the obligation for the crop operator to have prior agreement with the beekeeping operator within the prescribed radius.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently being grown in Estonia, we believe that clear rules are needed to co-exist GM and non-GM crops.
At least until it has decided to declare Estonia GMO-free, "said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it should be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and the administrative burden for the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection of GM crop locations and operators and the training of management, lays down requirements for GM crop management and start-up activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, the current obligation of GM crop growers to inform beekeepers of the start of cultivation of GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult this in the information system of the drafts and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The changes planned will affect, in particular, those active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the agricultural agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 is allowed to be grown.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in GM farming.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, the European stallion for which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also developed in southern regions and this maize is not compatible with our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Development has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination of GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of summer pasta, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of the varieties of oilseed rape, maize and soya grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that no genetically modified crops are deliberately grown in Estonia and that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of a "genius."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited a genius in the face of Nemanja Maticu since the midfield player made his debut on Wednesday night against Sampdor.
A 40 million pounds player bought over from Chelsea started in Dublin in the last pre-season game of Unite before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday, winning 2-1 in the starting line, making an impression on the role of defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the offensive.
However, while absent from the pre-season Asian tour of the Blues, Maticu was badly lacking in the match form and lasted only 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved firmly before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him get to the uniform as soon as possible."
As Matic, in the opening line of the Aviva Stadium, the other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began, and Mourinho started quietly putting in place his own starting men for the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work," by concluding contracts with three out of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another armored son got a GSM transmitter on foot on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living in his finger, the first stooge became a chaperone-equipped ring, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Great Gulf.
This is because the Ring is not a crop field, the Voice of the Islands writes.
On this Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the throats, and another son of a bitch and this on Muhu Island got on the transmitter.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a son of a bitch named Mati's GSM transmitter was supplied with a ring on Turk.
"His activities are all over the Internet: how he went to Spain to winter, coming back to the German-Polish border for a long time, and then came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a handle.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could just, by hand, open his front door, get into the office and even start the car.
Steven Northham, 33 years old, had a small chip inserted between his thumb and forefinger and now provides this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anaesthesiologist at the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also replace the locks on houses and cars to match the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child's father has now installed the technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military documents published by TIME, the White House decided to fly a Navy helicopter last month to the southern courtyard for an American production event to pay the taxpayers $24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's stay on board, was the central attraction of the American construction programme event that took place on 17 July in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their rounds.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the helicopter operating squadron Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military aid required a helicopter presence sub-command, FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed for an "unusual" event in the south yard.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," said the HMX-1 commander, the day before the event, in e-mail to his boss, the deputy naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard on the morning of July 17 for an event starting at 3: 00 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 6 and 21 p.m. on the same night.
It was added that, should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second eclipage is needed for return flights due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to TIME whether or not another eclipage was finally needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told it was not a violation," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," answered the deputy officer in charge.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" an official event, and the Hatch Act would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president supported the health reform efforts that were being discussed in the Senate at that time and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in line.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is no new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for purely photographic purposes is unusual.
Trump got a lot of attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background by the president's plane, and his Twitter account is crawling with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the presentation of" Made in America "where products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers from American materials were represented," said Lindsay Walters, White House spokesman.
HMX-1 teams often take pilot flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the US President's White House with centimeters of precision.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 pilot landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the "American Made" flight crew was included in the training standards for this month's flight.
The squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, none of the other exponents of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition of the helicopter in the south yard.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents for the President's flights and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is USD 24 380 per flight hour.
The squadron documents indicated the length of the flight from its basic base at the Navy Quantico airport in Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreparable costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations. ';
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, former spokesman of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it. "
It is not clear whether Trump touched the helicopter in the south yard during the event, or not, but he did sit behind the fire truck wheel.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives, making fun of the company's products in his own aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - peace and joy came through tears
In 2011, MMI Daegus hit Shaadeko in the final area, with a leg cramp in a 800-metre run, and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received zero distance jumps at a universityheld in China.
In 2012, Helsinki EM was damaged by a low cost injury, but during the debut Olympics in London he received 6013 points in 23rd place.
However, the misfortune continued.
The 2013 Moscow MMI received a thumb injury in the Estonian distance jump of the Estonian record after the opening day.
Two years later, he got the 15th place in Beijing World, and he was doing the Olympic rule, but that was more of a disappointment to the athlete.
The heaviest juniper ticket ever passed through Shadeiko was only a year ago when he did not receive a record of the result at the early Amsterdam Emil.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-race once.
Once, "confessed Shadeiko.
The worse was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic race in Rios was broken by a thigh injury on the first hurdle.
The time had come to take it down. Do you even want to continue with the seven races?
Is two days of effort worth all this?
She thought long, but she found peace in herself.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and clear your head.
"I knew I wasn't gonna put the pills in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page clean and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mäg, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the caretaker, but he realised that the athlete first and foremost had to find out for himself.
He was so beat up by everyone.
It was hard to put up with.
"But Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his own good.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set 6280 points in the new Estonian record at the Götzis multi-race.
In a high-level competition, he improved his own high-ranking brand by close to a metre (13.89) and ran in the barrier of a record close to time.
Then the multi-contestant felt that it was not a ceiling of powers at all, but that the deleted was just a primary race hunger.
Mägi, who guided him for years, says that Shadeiko is a student of art.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
If something's wrong or something's wrong, he'll say it right away.
She knows her body and trusts her sense.
That's what we have to start with.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the maximum in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby happiness of the loved ones will make you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of those close to him.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and the multi-contestant has received support from new world citizens.
"It's been quite interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to the "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" wine tasting process.
By smelling glass, spinning wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing aftertaste, we're putting our brains to work to create taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine statuettes do not actually contain taste, but taste is produced by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings a comparison of how the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste is created by a wine taster," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, exhorts that wine is not to get drunk.
"There has to be more in action," he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive drinking of wine can damage the brain instead of its benefits - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay from colleagues
The data from the Personnel Search Company Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT employees receive less pay from their colleagues.
Ten percent pay gap between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
The Foundation's ICT sector wage survey involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8,577 posts were examined.
63% of the posts were occupied by men.
"While only 3 companies stated that the pay gap was in favour of men and that the remaining companies did not see any pay gap, in reality, compared with similar works, the basic monthly salary for men is on average 10% higher than that for women and the total annual salary for men is on average 8% higher than that for women," said Fontes analyst Ilmar Pohala.
"Narcose" season 3 billboard: now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Netflix hit-and-run cartel will take centre stage.
Despite the fact that in Narcos's second season, Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed, the Netflix series has far from ended.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the flow service and the first of them has already been produced by a billboard that is teasing the series with new evils.
In the third season, the DEA will focus its attention on the world's richest drug trafficking organization, the Cal cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, "like the Fortune 500 company," with just more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of contacts with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.
In a brand-new ad clip, Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Penana, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcose's third season will open on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The UN Head of Mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for election in local councils, three women stand for vice-president and more than 30% of recently registered voters are women.
"The importance of the role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections to the Afghan local councils and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been relentlessly transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role played by women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense for both big and small.
There is always too little time together, but training with the ponds provides a good opportunity to combine meeting, game, proximity and burden.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, you always carry the live gloves and remember with your little voice impatiently: "Let's practice now!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to have a regular cock game or run along the coastline.
The canopy is the foundation for staying in the shape of feet and buttocks - who would like to take the shape of a sandcake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of bars!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the trainer's strength.
Those who are advanced can also make pitches with quite large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and feels the fun of the opportunity to lean high and to be important.
Bigger kids can do their own squats at the same time.
The extent of movement is determined by touching the ground and reaching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-assistant to hold on properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is extremely useful, but for a child a hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column to run through it.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to do when you can shake hands with a friend.
To add the load, you can stay in the plank, on a small ledge, and walk around in this position.
For extra weight, you can put a smaller child on your hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs are mowing on sand, trickles, ash and abs get a load like a snap.
The child falls on his feet so that his body weight is evenly distributed forward and back.
You can hold hands for safety.
Fold your legs and stretch straight up.
The kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be difficult.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra load is provided by the stretch of the legs.
Make sure the back remains in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun with a pair and a clap.
A handjob and a pulsed doo-doo.
Watch the child's safety, the position of the knee, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent while really effective throughout the body exercise.

From the Philippines to a wide world, or to the heart of the fashion fans.
Sacks of straw are a summer classic, which has become a separate hit product in recent years, which has to be hung by the hand of a proper summer singer and which has been able to be welded by traders despite its modest origin.
A bag plastered on the shoulders is probably one of those things that has existed every time in life and that has not given rise to any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it isn't, nothing's broken.
Now the sacks of straw are making a real race, and the fashion fans have changed their fancy designer sacks for the summer months against the simple sacks of straw.
It is not just a beach bag, but it is just as popular today as a street spy, and even the bolder women walk into an office with it.
It is worth making it clear, however, whether a summer look like this still sits or whether it is worth pushing the notebook and laptop to a slightly more formal sumadan.
The wealth of exchange has turned the sacks of straw into a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion logs, the first thing you can see is that fashion surgeons, on their holiday trip, first place them on the local market and buy themselves a sackcloth, which is then the faithful of the whole holiday season and which goes along with the beach, the market and also the girlfriends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags on the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that women (and men!) in the real world would probably go hand in hand to each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because few are these times when it is possible to buy some of the things that have come up in fashion for only some euro.
It is true that smart traders have also discovered a simple way of making money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably just so the richer clients don't have to feel like a mere mortal who promenade with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag for over a thousand euros.
However, the interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag can be used for around €6,000.
Unlike most fashion makers, the sacks of straw don't come from some big mould, but their story started far away.
It is said that sacks of straw come from far away from the Philippines, where they have been transferred to the wide air.
Beating a bag of straw is primarily an export business there, and locals are very often not seeing them.
It is claimed that the straw-braiding technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to the ordinary basket-braiding technique.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be as hard as the basket, patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and also more aggressive can be embedded in them.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips in them.
The letter of thanks may, however, be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the biggest braided sackcloth fan had not been seen before.
In fact, he matched his shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play a smaller role, but it is also because taking care of them is a cocksucker and, unlike any other Sumadan, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As always in the case of trending raids, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations besides their classic appearance.
For example, if you want, you can buy yourself a shoulder-braided rib or a tiny shoulder bag instead.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic sash bag never goes out of fashion, but the sling hole does.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, it has been considered to be a classic bag of straw, which resembles a basket of its style, is open and short, as well as straw, shrubs.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company expects confirmation from the managers of the cookie manufacturer McVitie of the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent on the future of the Tollcross investment.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, more than 500 people work.
McVitie's owner of Pladis said that they have invested more than 5 million pounds in an object in the last few years.
There were more employees and the trade union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes in the operations of the factory.
In a letter sent to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed a request to McVitie to "unleash concerns that the funding was not used to modernise production lines'.
GMB's senior organiser, Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we do not get an explanation from the head of the site about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
A number of generations of families have worked here and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, Glasgow needs, from the point of view of jobs, wages and well-being in the east, and Brexit, a company with a strong growth in productivity in McVitie in the face of rising housing costs and a chronic decline in production. '
The Pladis representative said: "The Tollcross site manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between workers and representatives of the GMB, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are going to review their activities on a rolling basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross object, most of which has gone to production lines and improvement of operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production object, and if there are any changes in its activities, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his efforts to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record invasion?
This noisy approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of buying-in, which was set up last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world who will receive more than GBP 500 000 a week from PSG after payment.
Barcelona is known to be angry about both the approach and the break-in of Neymar, although a source close to Catalans' board confirms that the club has always been the best care for the football player since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser warned all clubs that were thinking about recruiting one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll meet them and contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, as the Spanish club showed an interest earlier this summer in PSG's central field player Marco Verratt.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could be given a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from this," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, "said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Mr Varadkari, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it cannot be done, to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Referring to the fact that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have one with Great Britain."
The alternative would be to return to customs points which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"Barriers to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Märt Avandi through his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass through anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in Otepää in the winter capital, when about one thousand triathlets from over thirty countries took place for the half-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70,3 miles consisted of 1,9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among other things, Märt Avandi was victorious in the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would be difficult, and eventually it was difficult," said Avandi in the finish line.
In spite of the complexity, Avandi said that in fact the triathlon is capable of being a head for all.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the tempo that kills," he said, suggesting that at the right pace, almost everyone gets to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, then ten hours a week.
By 05: 34: 12 he reached the 270th place in total.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04: 59: 53) and to Jürgen Lig (time 05: 06: 37), he won the other so-called "nominees" in the class.
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was "a good example ', lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppin in 16 minutes (time 05: 50: 23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in approximately an hour (time 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45: 18, respectively).
The German Johannes Molda was crowned the general winner of the calculation of the men of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series 3: 58: 27; the Estonians were the best of the Ivo Great Age 04: 14: 09.
Among the women, Helle Frederis was defeated by the Danes in the time of 04: 24: 01, while of the Estonians Mary Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour, and received the time of 04: 58: 58.
Avandi passed a 1,9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410th position.
