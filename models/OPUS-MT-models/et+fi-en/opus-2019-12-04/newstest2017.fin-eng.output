A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and he says, "His affairs finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Sanfrancisco Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was a homicide and that an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a liner cook in Boston, had had his dream job as the liner chef of the Sanfrancisco restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said that they are "terrified and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missed very much," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the first night in the hostels, but that, recently, "his affairs were finally going well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGB.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of quarrel.
He was the brother who was drifting along with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a rough diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with any information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees strike: Requirements for new combat measures
The representatives of the medical trainees have asked their trade unions to adopt new industrial action measures in their dispute concerning the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the Council as a whole to support further measures in the fight against labour from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns regarding the agreement.
In July, doctors' trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
On Thursday evening, in a letter published through Twitter to Members, the President of the JDC, Ellen McCourt, said that the government had remained 'persistently silent' on the issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject fully the proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for an early, progressive and expanding programme of industrial action.
As a result of the dispute, doctors' trainees have taken six strikes this year, including the first complete stop in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
The director of the BMA medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote to reject the terms and conditions negotiated by the BMA.
He had informed the members of the BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was a good one and that it should be approved.
After the vote, the health minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be awarded to the doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside association?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally declare the end of the eight-month fight against words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the palace of St. Petersburg, I was given the clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, they were shaking hands at the event.
But Putin's smile looked strong, and he didn't give much heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyep Erdogan kept talking about his "dear friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was ferocious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, a state-controlled media led to an astonishing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious of them were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by Isis.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs every friend he can have after he was almost overthrown in last month's failed coup d'état.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush into the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey were again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as described in the Vedemosti report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
In addition to the long-standing resentment of the EU membership negotiations at the speed of the snail, Putin, who is eager to use cool and break Turkish ties to the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly scored at Ankara, where he called after a revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is the survival of Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the beautiful seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to introduce a 'group of outsiders', as a certain analyst described to me: two countries that feel that the West has abandoned them and treated them wrong, unifying their powers.
However, there are major differences between the two, despite public conciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself with the role of a peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that, after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr Putin chose to emphasise them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can seek a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster when a NATO member of Turkey shoots down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are even on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
At the moment, the Bank's strategies have used the "RBS" brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the head office and stock exchanges will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness Shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees, because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards the brand bank, because basically (we have asked) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins.
Dettori sprays champagne after the double win he has a total of 3000 wins
The rider Frankie Dettori secured his 300th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone in his second victory of the night at his home track when he competed with John Gosden on predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches this milestone in racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edder and Willie Carson.
Three-time Master Jockey Dettori, who won earlier on Ghayar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The Dettor will absorb the cheering when he leads Predilection out after the victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in the obstacle races - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical intelligence separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a wonderful ambassador to the races, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for many years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he weren't just a weekend jockey and a big jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has ridden the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is a good thing for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone in the landing of the saddle by a drone formed as his trademark.
From airplanes to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race race for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He also survived the plane crash and suffered a non-compete on account of drugs.
Three years ago, he was difficult to begin with when he returned after six months of non-compete, but he showed considerable character in challenging the sceptics and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has said in the past that he would like to continue to compete until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin fire Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to leave the post of Head of the Russian Presidential Administration ', but there was no reason to do so.
Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
The deceased, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be replaced.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Security Service of the Soviet Union in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, shown by state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew from his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin Ivanov on the Kremlin website, "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me a four-year responsibility for this very complex task, I wish I could even say work.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months. "
Mr Ivanov accepted the mandate in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second term of Putin, because Puti's third period would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another ally close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired for hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a set set set in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, the actor Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and arguments at the scene.
I regret that it happened, "he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how to remove Gibson's character from the FBI team are expected later.
The 54-year-old who used to be the star of the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminals, and I have given it everything for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be with you until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans that the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
The man who lives in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by the water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
£1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected Queensferry's crossing point to the north deck and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four parentheses between the "ferns," which are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge. "
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finalising the bridge-bridge closure is a demanding operation where extreme precise dimensions must be matched.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover of the last section of the deck is being poured today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be placed on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the tip of construction technology.
When the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the extension of the northern pillar road deck, we then had to close the remaining section on the north side, that is, the inland side.
This was done by pulling 700 mm south of the road bridge of the northern fairway.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be pulled at about 3% of the slope angle.
It is demanding because the tolerances that the team was working were tiny, just a few millimetres in both directions.
But I'm glad everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by themselves.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men, and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the pilot of the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to the coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men who got in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a kill switch rope on the boat's engine, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable health and happiness hunt
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but rather that they will spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and take part in some kind of action.
The display time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now, recently, smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not rule out each other.
I am referring, of course, to the craze called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later on, they were created by a series of cartoons, playing cards and other follow-up products).
As with many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the game release in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity of overloaded servers.
Only in days Pokémon Gole had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
In the case of nuts, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are traced by GPS, and which after being discovered can be "photographed" (by means of a screen capture on the phone) or "caught."
The generation that played the game at a younger age has joined the craze and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person."
The Apple Watch app, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game's publication, the number of people moving within 30 minutes of the day jumped from 45% to 53% for the following users.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns' call for 'find 30', 'get off the couch' and 'be active every day' have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and caring people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who regularly move are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. The benefits are too varied to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're hunting.
As usual, resentful jailers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there used to be applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and the use will cease in due course.
However, because of Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's gymnastics multi-match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity thing.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic jumping.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on the perm.
It's great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world exposed to the Olympic spotlight.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and the final five teammate, Aly Raisman, and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States Simone Biles on balance marks in the final of the women's scaffold gymnastics multimatch at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to have won the multi-match championship in a row, and the fifth American champion in all. At the same time he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class as the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated his species by winning 15 World Cup medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose ambition and precision mix has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
A return to the family home in Texas Springs without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning a gold and silver medal (in this order) women's scaffolding at the multi-game final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination of the departure party of the retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, the one with his trademark folding, is adapted to Latin American music, which would be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother while she was on her way to study in the gym where Boorman was coaching, has become a force factor.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak is likely to last as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance figure and the permanto, where Biles is the dominant champion of the world, were waiting.
He stood at the top of the line at 15: 433 and exceeded them by getting 15: 933 on the permanta.
Raisman hugged him kindly when they were waiting for the endpoints - just a formality - and the tears rose to the glitter red, white and blue of Biles' eyes, when the dream of which he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in a divided third place, but lost a bronze to Mustafina during the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "Grandma," was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the public after his perm performance in an emotional state of return, which sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's extensive tweeting of the past week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of a serial murder were shot while listening to music in the car
In the most deadly attack of the first serial killer case in Phoenix in the last decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as was reported in a police bulletin published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The bulletin says that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped on another vehicle.
According to the police, triple homicide doesn't seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the assailant didn't take the handbags or the other adult victim's $2,900.
A representative of the Phoenix Police Department, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led scientists to investigate whether it was connected to the four previous attacks.
All in all, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over four months, mainly in two Latin American districts.
"These happen in the residential area in front of home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several means of transport, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence leading to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized later because of his injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple murder, targeting an empty convertible van, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "The situation will be relieved"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, as a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised, "he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking with a stroller.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
Plus, he loves to play with his two brothers and he sings.
Elizabeth will show you how the signs Edmund invented sign "sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephalia may be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of people who are infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It'll get easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rainfall and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi.
The heavy rainfall and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that the numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their thunderstorms and caused a massive flood due to extreme rainfall.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, the Governor's Office for Security and Emergency Response, said that they are receiving requests for high tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the county of Tangipaha alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in a large part of South Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that further rain is expected in the region from three to five cents.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set the peak flood record during the weekend.
Weather reporter Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding of the Ascension district below the river is at risk as the flooded rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas.
On Friday morning at 9: 00, the Tickfast River, which flows south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest level ever.
Saviors are still picking up people from flood water in the counties of Akes and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were on Friday near Gloster among the survivors.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other half of the boy who lived near him warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family are all injured and that he is the only one able to swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the three in a big army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescue workers stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods' spread rapidly 'as heavy rainfall continues, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rainfall and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipaha County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, reported by the authorities.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipää a member of the City Council said 200 homes were flooded.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now flooded.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by rising water.
In the cities of Amis and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipaha, 20 streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to collect sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last great flood here was in March," said the city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be the same case.
In Mississippi, the emergency director of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said that a steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported flooded, but so far there has been no flood reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, "Full of Bullets," survived the shootout in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several surgeries.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting from the station.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking to see if either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators are telling CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The type of casings of the attack weapon, which originated from different types of attacks, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," the Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl got hit by a stray bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
The most successful female gymnast in the last four years has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are presenting unexpected but masterful gymnastics programmes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to have won individual gold in a series of women's multimatch.
And my teammate, Aly Raisman, got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but this is not how it looks in gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this will be Marta Karolyn's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competitive fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
A large proportion of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
With these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes ever since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie are inspired by numerous young girls.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15 000 young people (mostly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) in order to provide a high level of gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
The gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, as well as for school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl strength" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical trainees organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on "unknown ground" and that even further delays would damage staff and patients.
The first interns will be transferred to a new contract, which will include changes to night-time and weekend work patterns to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Medical Trainees, said last night in the opinion: "The medical trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
While there are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes a deep silence.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he doesn't, the interns will be ready to continue their work-fighting efforts.
The last strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 hours of reception, when nurses and consultants were recruited to replace the doctors on strike.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants better weekend pay for contract employees with 54,000 medical trainees.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers' Association, appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Work battles achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a difficult situation, causing concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from the sabbatical, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - would indicate how serious employers, the Health Education England Training Organisation and the Ministry of Health are about respect for the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The medicine used to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given as long as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS Controller NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people are having a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these people are having another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter accumulated in the artery wall, which forms cramps.
If the stenosis rips, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the circulation of blood into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot falls off, it can pass with blood and break the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, sold under the trading name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE draft guidance document published today recommends that 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the following two years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective prevention treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
The fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we recommend ticagrelor provisionally, we are pleased to be able to add the available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from it.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance document does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions.
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lufur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of the widespread vote in Muslim communities, which is being exposed today in a shocking government report.
The former Minister of Government, Sir Eric Pickles, is trying to get the police, election supervisors and city councils to ignore the evidence of the electoral fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity '.
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guards outside the polling stations to protect those who are afraid.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when they vote to prove who they are.
Nowadays, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the person to vote should be printed in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Exhibitors should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect the local government from electoral fraud, but would protect the local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the voting scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lufur Rahman, should be suspended as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting acting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the post-election vote in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told to put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the identification of the identity with the identity card.
He says in his report: "Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were put under pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh backgrounds.
"There were concerns that..." the state institutions had ignored this kind of behaviour because of the "politically correct" racial and religious hypersensitivity. "
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists dealing with ballot papers coming by post in order to stop 'collecting votes'.
The report that Mrs May is looking at also requires more stringent amendments for those who register to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options to prove the identity of the voters before voting.
Use the indelible ink on the person's finger so that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting via mail.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-to-post votes and envelopes in which they are sent.
Let the police put security chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at the polling stations.
Require that only English is used at the polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter has to enter the booth alone.
Sir Eric is going to kill the Great London police force, saying that it's "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court will stay as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal activity by Lufur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, without any doubt, on the basis of the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised inefficient "tick-to-box" checks in the voting agencies of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as a source of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation. "
Crazy about Kate's biker doppelganger and other famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have lost their minds about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic players who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the US men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the US men's archery team, Brady Ellison, has caused a storm on Twitter since he surfaced his pictures, where he seems to scare the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he had heard that he looked like Leo.
"Personally, I don't see much resemblance except maybe with the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the striking resemblance between British longjump Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, obvious eyes, has been said to be the double of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, Cameron van der Burgh, a South African swimmer, has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Actor of Inception.
Another long-term comparison has been between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnet, both with the same strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion Yulia Efimova has more than just tan skin and blond hair with the same actor Annalyne McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team reminds fans of the "sport version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Play Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actor really do have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner, gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful, broad smile matches the smile of the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator sends an apology for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 4-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4-year-old Women's 4x200-metre liberation message infuriated the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its reporters said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female cleaner had "lost like a bad smell" and "died like a pig."
The photographer Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions on women's 4x200 meters freelance in the message file.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's debriefing team to bring "color," was heard saying, "Baby, that little 14-year-old kid from China..."
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that. "
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam during the second part of the message 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Viewers all over Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'??
The idiot didn't realize he was still live. "
The Chinese Ai Yanhani was described in the 4 x 200-metre Women's Liberation Communication Fact: "That little 14-year-old Chinese cocksucker, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was loud and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who was running a CBC broadcast, immediately apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on the swim performance was received.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we regret that this has happened. "
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
My colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and added an apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and followers for their apologies on the air in the social media.
For the sake of clarity, Mr Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean that it could be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologise in this moment for the comment I made last night after the message from the women," he said at the CBC Olympics.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
"It may be unnecessary to say that I did not mean it as disrespectful, and that I am truly sorry."
Primark's client is stunned by a woman who bravely atoned for lingerie in the middle of the shop.
The customers didn't know where to look when she got undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try on her underwear.
Things didn't improve because after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally settled four pairs of underpants in a shop in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where she made up underpants and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who was in the store, said that after trying on her underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of the underpants that were on display, took off her stockings and underwear and put on her matching feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to make atonement," he just stood there with no shame. "
"Everyone was staring at him while he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided he didn't like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underpants he made up."
33-year-old Davidson, living in the city of Kent, said, "It is disgusting to think that someone takes home a pair of underwear that someone else has tried, but has not been cleaned."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I understood that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident at the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market. '
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you were approached from the front or from the back, this video shows how you can pay the assailant the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
Then you grab a gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you punch the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the groin on the knee, and when the assailant goes from pain to pain, twist the gun out of his hand, hit him with the back of the gun on his face and back off while the gun is pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time put some weight on the gun and hit the assailant in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video on how exactly Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for the tour guide
The British tourist has placed a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomit reflex by licking some of Europe's most dirty and disgusting places.
The host and travel writer Ian Wright from Suffolk, 51, licked the euro banknote, railing at Piccadilly Circus, the train toilet flushing button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to face.
However, the experiment, which was made by a film called the Internal Force, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train flushing button used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the sink in the kitchen.
On his journey across Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester of the endurance of his intestines as he travelled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from the public rail station railings to the toilet seat flushing button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "Since I was a child, I have been quite carefree in my health, and I have put in my mouth all kinds of things from the soil, worms and the damp water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had over 4,000 units on the photometer.
For comparison purposes, the counter-washed hands should read less than 60.
But in one of the Russian public toilets, he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4000 units, and the counter-washed hands had less than 60.
Wright has produced a visitor's movie, Internal Power, along with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
The movie said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting here.
With internal power, production was combined with Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the director of the snacks, juice and new categories in Valio said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, which would at the same time explain the probiotics' interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'.
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, about the importance of gut health and its connection with the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The director of the documentary, Tom Hakala, added: "Let me put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, such as the disgusting Russian latrine shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we saved some of those dirty licks. "
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents combined lactic bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that at least occasionally they use products that have been added to them.
The Oyster family destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted.
The Oyster family caused damages of £50,000 to their rental house after being evicted for the terror of their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after they had been complained about several times.
After they had been removed from the property by force, upset housing company employees found the property in bad condition.
The walls had been filled with emptying holes, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread to the floor and the walls had been cremated with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the people, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are many points to consider here, since this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is reputable, and their names are reputable. "
The couple had three boys who lived in real estate sometimes, and the police said that the family's tyranny included a street fight with baseball bats, intimidation of close residents, drug use, drug sales, excessive yelling, fighting and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms under the demolition threat found old waste.
The property from which drugs have been cared for in the past, the floorboards had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police called regularly.
Cornwall House forced the woman and her partner out of the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to change voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction saying that their lives had become hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here on an incredible number of occasions.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here... we're not used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone. "
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall House neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has been living in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and family behaviour, because eviction is always the last course of action Cornwall House considered.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous members of the community who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send out a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in the twenties.
After eviction, the dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the waste piles around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as scales, supplies and GBP 1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for giving his guilt for possession of class b drugs as a means to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her associates live homeless now in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had graffiti.
The police say they're trying to evict the residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police said that eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their behaviour is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behaviour," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew off the beach with a very low altitude.
Sunworship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives.
The Portuguese Air Force, P-3C Orion, swept past a very low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, the horrified tourists began to panic as the low-flying jet swept over the full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came almost into contact with the sun worshippers in the sand strip in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, although they did not see at first what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic passing through social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It went by twice really low, and at one point it seemed like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke from close-up fires, but the Air Force assured us that no one was in danger of being safe.
The fires this summer have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and four people have also died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that affected visibility, the smoke caused by the fires and the thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats
Expecting the first half of the year better than expected
In January to June, the Social and Health District of South Karelia (Exoote) achieved a better result than planned of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
This was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the waiting lists.
The extract shall cover the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten the queues and to buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be €4.6 million better than planned.
The Government of Exoten will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special bailiffs took a military oath in Immola
Seventy conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military jury was held in Immola on Friday.
The grand jury of the 10th Special Border Jäger Course was held in the garrison sports field.
The military oath was made by 70 garrisons.
Special border fighters are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border iceberg.
They invited 250 of them for the selection tests.
Special border rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in the veteran meeting at the whaling ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A drawing of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operated by the RTA unit, the Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
Chief of Staff works for Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian, married to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, considered by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is producing various reports to the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would less often leave the scene of the whistle only when they get the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target daily police activity where it is most needed.
In the context of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up, under three national units, and at each police station its own criminal intelligence unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police, is in charge of the activities at national level.
The PTR units have people working from the Police, Customs and Border Guard, as they call them.
The RTA units, for their part, work in regions divided according to the police services and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes through registers, alert mission databases and findings.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on what he did, there's a certain image of the unsub.
Sequences may be made either on the basis of the method of performance or by the person concerned, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk the city with their collar up, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals and themselves are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police attempts to fight crime.
The methods are publicly reported by the police if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, a form of marking of vacant dwellings, which was reported in early summer, used in housing breaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest order the district court protocol, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time we steal gloves.
An interview has been held with Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen from Häme Police Department, Lieutenant Tuomo from Lepola from Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police are gathering and analysing information to plan practical action.
In the background, the decline in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage Pora reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A school girl who joined Daddy from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, has been reported to have died in Syria.
Counselor Tasnai Akunjee said that the girl's family heard her death in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
The ITV News announced on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian air strike on Raqqa, which is the organisation's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning an escape from a war-torn country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a testament to others that there are real risks of going to war zone - that it could make people give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other school girls from East London flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that she had married a Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he's elected.
The Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid says that he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The head of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will elect a candidate for the replacement of the late Supreme Court Member, Anton Scalia.
On Thursday, Reid said in a phone conference that he predicted "with some certainty" that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He told Garland that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that republicans who obstruct the appointment of Garland are "henchmen" and "facilitators" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men."
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of being a nude celebrity, they're going to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, the chairman of the Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with lots of nude pictures differs from the Playboy of the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's for them too.
"We must begin to present the timeless and classic nudity of women, as well as men, where they feel comfortable and inspired by these images of naked female bodies," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill out a comment section with irritated insults written by a nickname EiAll Solitary Middle-aged Men, you will notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouTube, the much-spoken new coming of disks is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited by the novelty of physical objects, but by the cataracts of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl disc are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18 to 24 year olds who buy the most unlikely records is among them.
It is also not just about collecting enthusiasts, but also about emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs 66%).
But is YouTube's results correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me when I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would be very careful before I stop, I would make a cup out of my hands and say something authoritative, such as, "Let's look at this more closely."
Let's get a closer look at this.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office stores are now filling buildings with independent shops in the past - a handful of wonderful specialised record stores are still in place.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops while trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
The Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) in Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear above the picture (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of disks and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60's and early 70's, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that disc buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice. "
The 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouTube profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the records have come back in fashion and who have had the need to buy back their old records.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have generally been rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back, "he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of Vinyl Awareness at a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes a few seconds for a store like Phonica to realize that a record store offers comfort to the same-minded types of community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the near payment system.
Some vinyl fans can fade from the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of familiar record decks; objects that raise the memories of teenage days of happiness.
"I think sometimes it may be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the record pile.
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl disc in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of people who buy vinyl have no record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably seem seriously concerned when I was browsing the bossa nova collection stack.
This "award" aspect of awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who works in the Sound of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said," I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead disc so we can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a large proportion, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So, not parents, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
In Fop, where today there is almost a whole layer reserved for vinyl, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements, the loudspeakers are being cleared by Wild Beast's most recent syndicate and sex-filled pop, and no improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove a deafening psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so record collection isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... "he sighes in love.
"I don't know how to explain it. It's very unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look at jeans shorts, I observe a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with Adele's, Jeff Buckley's, Amy Winehouse's and Fleetwood Mac's records covered: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are merely ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
But given that even the slightest attention received by these items can mean more money for industry and send a few customers to Soho to get more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But although my findings suggest that YouTube's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings chilling around the Berwick Street record shops, browsing records and avoiding the ghastly, 30-year-old fake TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say Holker has a longer life span than any other backbone on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied Haiti, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application to close the sale of the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to dismantle 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros at temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that sites should be dismantled because they represent an unpaid parallel economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by a state-sponsored organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people who run temporary trade, but said that the concern of the prefect of Calais "was perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding "people living in extremely uncertain conditions."
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates on a non-profit basis and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to the top of the list - since the arrival rate rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food is falling sharply in Finland for consumers' pleasure and for producers' trouble.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become more expensive than 1%.
Over the last three years, food prices in Finland have fallen second most in those EU countries with the same wage levels as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data derive from the written by Ilkka Lehtinen, Statistics Finland's Development Manager, published in Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is this year's June.
In the early 2010's, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then a turn followed, and after that, food has become cheaper year after year.
Now the price is heavy by the Russian ban on food imports, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agricultural products have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," says Lehtinen.
The tightening of price competition in manufacturing and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large chains of S-Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as an impressive advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not the place for cheap food, although food prices have fallen heavily.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same anymore.
Anyone returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan describes the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fine writing will be abandoned, and instead, schools will start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education starts at the fourth.
The main change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
They used to think the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting on a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived backbone of the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks are swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold a second record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
As growth rate is slow, the observations indicate that only about one centimetre per year, adult individuals have still lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Mr Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen were consulted.
He determined the age of the adult ice sharks of 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio carbon timing of the spectacles.
The mean age of the examined sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent Amazonian cookies, were exposed to the age of approximately 335 and 392 years.
As it has been found in previous studies that ice sharks reach maturity only at 4 metres, researchers calculated that they are at that stage about 150 years old.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired for almost 300 people - no one cuts off sales.
Almost 300 employees are being laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operating companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of the negotiations is a reduction of around 300 jobs, most of which will take the form of redundancies," Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The negotiations at Stockmann concerned about 3 000 workers.
At the beginning, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The aim of this reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulty in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade continues to make losses.
According to the CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," says Veijäinen in the press release.
The performance improvement for the second quarter was mainly due to the successful success of Lindex's clothing chain.
The chain reached its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainfall in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from the HS.
There are rainfall in the middle of the country as well, but there are pits on the south side.
The temperature is no longer very high in the summer, as mercury is below 20 ° C in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenyan sports team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt.
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was performing as a national athlete in a doping test.
News agency AP told us that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a surprise test sample as Rotichina.
Doping officials came to turn Anzrah over to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour, "said Mr Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, when he came to the news office, Reuters.
The Olympic sport begins on Friday, and Rotichi is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich scored last year at the World Cup on his way to fourth and is in advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was using the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and they took him to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed, "the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio sports stadium rubble its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, watching sports.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was started on the medals of universal sport, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show their skills to an unfathomable audience.
The Rio organizers told on Friday that only 58% of the first day's morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was one in London, where the stadium was cheering about a cheering crowd.
The finals' tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The distribution of the Olympic Games in Rio has attracted attention even before sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, paddling and riding.
When the Brazilian medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twin, the Netherlands played against Russia and only about 30% of the 12 000 people were full.
At least the bad news is that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far away from European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilian people who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium full.
The organiser's spokesman, Mario Andrada, told us this weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million remaining to be sold," said Mr Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets to the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000.
More than half of the tickets are less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympic Games, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to the less well-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get a right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation was founded last year to acquire ecologically important natural areas.
Private, corporate and community entities can then redeem their rights as holders of land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire in exchange for the payment of the right of the holder.
The holder will have a veto right in a block of 187 square metres, which means in practice that not every holder needs to be approved if the land is to be changed for its purpose.
Holders' rights may also be acquired for more than one segment.
Acquisition of the right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You do not have to go anywhere to carry banderrolls or chain yourself up to protect nature, "Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired control of his company, explains.
For example, those who acquire the right to control receive accurate location information from their block, which allows for a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of those who acquired the ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the land section information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees as a risk to its acquisition of nature conservation only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public benefit foundation designed to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy Project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation buys land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly for the sale of rightholders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected areas.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki shopping market on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the biggest of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the number of inhabitants than in nine of the largest cities.
The Helsinki Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of the reported bike theft, how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August of this year, calculated per 1000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police records, there were four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two wheel steals per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," Tommi Reen, the police officer of the government.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Mäikäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, considers it rather unexpected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of wheel steals is largely dependent on the number of learning and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are separated from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the January to August period, slightly fewer bike theft has been recorded by the police throughout Finland than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are reporting just over 20 000 bike steals a year.
It means 50-60 flillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They are large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be discovered.
A typical verified bike theft is one where the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught with blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations, for example in a drug case where there may be stolen bikes in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves get caught weekly in the act themselves or in police investigations, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are being stolen, for example, from shopping centres' wheelsets, courtyards, warehouses and cellars, virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopos are the most frequently stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bike, for example, for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some people might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant as he may be guilty of a crime of concealment or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a fit bike is sold at a clear price," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsi to the shelters of Kallio's library in Helsinki for every day of his work.
He's had five wheels, but not one of them has been stolen, the Moose says. "Never been taken, has been a good monk since."
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsingian Moose wonders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike waved against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, like a bike rack.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad wheels, that kind of boogeyman."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from the courtyard of the building company.
Although the bike was unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be stolen.
Under the age of 15 to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the cycle of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator himself may join the Peer Jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Young officer Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
"All guide young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that, after their first crime, young people do not face the adult panel, but reflexes what has happened to people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Ilika Lovio, the service designer of Palmi, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault, which was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
"It has been a message that continue on the path you choose," Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Helsinki project of the Young Immigrants, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need them, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican players want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it in order to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be redirected to the Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring a landslide to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate targeting of all possible funds to the Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorative anchor around their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is the prominent Republican against Trump, Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children.
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, gave details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the American economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump wants to be president so the economy goes well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The centre of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for American workers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"[President] I object to all trade agreements that act against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the Republican economic programme announced by Donald Trump on Monday that it "favours only millionaires of this kind."
Trump's proposed downgrade to corporate taxes has previously been called "Trump's loophole."
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton peed.
These are Rio ratings: The races have not glued the Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
The sports competitions are usually shown in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have so far failed to reach the highest number of spectators.
At the same time, 12% of the population have been glued to the screens at best: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators from the Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Championships in general sport one month ago received almost 800 000 spectators at a time at TV2, and the European Football Championships received a fair amount of another million.
So far, the Olympic species have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Mr Pau Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that for the first time in the Rio Olympic Games, viewers are divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with the number of television viewers who choose the Olympic Games in general.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated to an entire channel.
When a broadcast comes in 24 hours a day, and there are viewers all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of rio's broadcasts come in overnight in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone thinks it is lame now - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the primaries, it would have boarded up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the audience has been close to what was expected.
When sports begin, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the competitions, which rose in Apple App Store on the first days of the Games to be the most uploaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're about 200 grand.
"The ratings of the network will not be available until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems at an early stage.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games appear on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
On Yle Fem you can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Speech passes the races daily.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious to the General ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, the Olympic Games will be seen both in the General and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters in the Ristinää.
It could be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technician-diving instructor, found a pressure of about 20 square meters in Ristiselä, the depth of which was 104 meters in the depth of the dive computer.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small recess of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters extend to Saimaa, Tosivesi and the main lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
This way, your Päijää will not be included in the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes of average depth were wrong.
Skin from the tax area: Tax on pensioners continues to tighten
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage and salary earners.
The Ihana says that the anomaly was brought up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be made equal to the wage and salary earners.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income from work, which reduced taxation.
The case was heated in Parliament by opposition representatives who grilled the then Minister for Finance Alexander Stubb (Co.) of the election promises.
Purchasing power will be secured. It won't grow.
In the line outlined by the Minister for Finance, Petteri Orpo (Co.), the main issue of tax cuts is, according to Ihala, to safeguard and not increase purchasing power, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's insecurity.
The Ihani is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and the Orpo for their willingness to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says it's important for credibility to stick to the treaty.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government period.
It has been done by the social partners, so it must not be destroyed by questioning.
This will be necessary because the economy is so heavily dependent on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Addressing prolonged unemployment in a quarrel
The deranged man appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget crisis, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were around 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed during the bombing of Finnish time.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand because of explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, "says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out specifically to Finns in Hua Hin to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalia, there's no record of the person responsible for the attacks yet.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict in relation to the Muslim population, says Westphalia.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalia.
He says the city is celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, these attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket and Hua Hin, popular by tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded in the newspaper.
According to local authorities, the popular tourist destination Hua Hin has launched a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
There was at least one death in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, Surat Than village and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in both.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of a military junta ruling Thailand, the perpetrators of the attacks are not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic more, he said to journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the advice of the High emissary on caution, "says Westphalia.
In wounded Europeans
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
There's been a little more information about the attack last night at Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutchmen and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near the clock tower known as the sightseeing.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
An employee of the county was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which blew up about half an hour ago.
Bangkok Post says the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won a women's quadruple match
The US Alexandra Raisman was second in 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina in third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still reaching for scaffolding in the Rio Games with perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics to a great extent over the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships from the last three years.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
The United States team in Biles has achieved two world championships.
The milder World Cup medals in Biles are from the jump and the boom.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huvila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think that there will be any more amazing results, the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates about twenty years working in the Huvila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If they haven't banished tourists before, I don't think this one has.
The company's office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The blanket heard about the attack from one of its own employees.
The employee called at about 9: 00 local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The villa says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set up for the Queen's birthday, "says Huvila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong's atmosphere was peaceful and the main street shops were allowed to open at about 10: 00 local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past half of the day in Thailand, Patong's traffic was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, "says the Huvila who went to the scene.
Later, the car in question was seen on Jouxholmintee in its Kronupys.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was caught right away.
One of them ran away, but later they found him in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to motor vehicles.
The police thank you for the tip.
Research Director of the Russian Leaders' Changes: Clear Replacement
In Russia, on Friday, the highest level of leadership change was made in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old with Estonian background.
He's an ex-diplomat. He was second in command of Ivanov.
Kangasporo says that the reason why Ivanov was fired may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up an independent power for themselves.
According to the fabric stream, it is also possible that Ivanov has been compromised by other leaders or has screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, takes over special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked to be reassigned and proposed that Vaina replace him, "said Russia Today.
Kangasporo says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet period.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but he was elected president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangasporo points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher Katri Pynnuniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place that Putin changes his immediate surroundings younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, "said Sherfan Darwish, representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90% of the city of Manbiji, which is important to Isis last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected to the previous news at 7: 30 p.m.: Previously, we misinformed you that the sirens were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document release is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutainen of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian says to the STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the State Council's Office and on the grounds that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under a race of values.
He insulted his back thigh in the early part of the year and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic qualifying.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key point, Mr Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included a bunch of low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, there is a sign that the star of Jamaica has risen in an age when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and a slipping interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was reduced to 200 metres in the early stages in the period 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by the injuries and your loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began on a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of the competitors, despite the final celebration, in the time of 9: 69.
This is harder.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached the legal point of his career, measuring the clock.
World records in Berlin at 9.58 metres and 19.19 in 2 hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
On 100, Bolt's greatest contender is the Olympic champion Justin Gatlin of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American with just one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the final of the lottery if he can get on the road.
In Daegu 2011, the 100-World Cup finals were left unrun by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as his last goal.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Exhibit from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, China's Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in a sample of doping from Chinese implants Chen Xinyi.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athlete was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of an epo-hormone.
He was fourth in Rio for a 100-metre-a-foot female butterfly swing.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese suimmer has taken his doping case to the International Civil Service Tribunal for Sport (ICC).
Xinhua tells us that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that the Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenia, for her part, has sent a sports coach home from Rio for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, told us that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media records, this is Kenyan speed-running coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-meter runner, Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will not be stopped by anything - historical gold came on display style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympic Games, Michael Phelps of the United States swam 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino ranked second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. The BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at the evening paper in a quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening paper website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get too stressed if there's a little noise in the social media or in the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
I mean, television is visual media, he stresses.
Skelton is wearing high-interest shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least for many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small things are just a funny thing.
Well, I'm sure Skelton wants to freak out, and maybe he does, but he stresses that he doesn't want to play a leading role.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the noise has gone all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grinds.
You know what?
It's a fuss out of nowhere if it comes from dressing up (host).
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests for suspected terrorism.
The Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the races.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by the police in July.
They believe that the detainees are connected to the Isis extremism.
It was reported that the detainees had incited violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been disseminated in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place off to the public.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time in the Rio Olympics when the police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package we found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the explosion.
The public didn't get to the stands by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package they found in the hangar.
The police blew up the package and let the public in the hall only after that.
The shot woke up the Spanish team that started the race with dreams.
With two losses, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria at points 96 to 87.
In the last two races Spain reached silver.
The police already performed a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time a police officer had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road cycling target last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian lady dressed Peteja-Siren - a Finnish citizen was thinking of a protest
The wind in the Cheater-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind on the Cheater-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady, on Thursday in Rio, put on the Wind Peterer Siren at the launch of the Day of Women's Surfing.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted to failure.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away, and the head coach of Finland, Joakim Wilenius, told us.
The athlete was considering a protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, then, because it would have been pointless under the rules of the Olympic Games.
I should have fallen into the water so I could be compensated, "said the Cheater-Siren.
The Finnish man hung on his board until the last because he didn't want to go into Rio's dirty water.
With the accident, the Finnish citizen remained in position at the time of his departure at 27.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Palestinian medalist is the eighth.
The accident with the tip didn't really affect much.
Friday is a big day when it's time to race for departure 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petey-Siren did not make a protest.
7 special issues which, according to science, prolong the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life extends.
Sometimes, things that can't be influenced by the person himself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to have a moderate or social presence.
Regular shopping can prolong age.
You don't have to go all the way out there to get a can of milk.
There's been a lot of research into the secret of a long age.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
Science says all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A study by Harvard University concluded that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to a "reduced risk of death ', particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, there are studies in favour of alcohol that suggest that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person's life by up to six years, a study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be more noisy people alive when the experiment was over.
Sex, where protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings extra years, and it is not a question of denying it.
However, achieving long-term age does not require absolute volatility.
A study by the University of Oxford found that the cholesterol levels of women with a large ass were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these issues with lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete who got into the Olympics or an actor who won the Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than a regular bumblebee.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long age is due to the social status of the person - who in turn makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of shopping behaviour among over 65 years of age found that the person shopping daily was likely to be less likely to be shopping older than the person shopping.
This is due to the fact that moving in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been shown to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So you're gonna have to put the credit card down on your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver derailed into the truck.
On Friday night a serious truck and passenger car crash took place in Koski in Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident took place in Koskell, mid-way between Koskenti and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the passenger car that came across had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left standing in its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went into a ditch and then, from there, across the ditch to the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car got squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in an aggravated DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket's bulk range was deficient because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to the Seinäjoki river.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday to buy candy from Salo's K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk sweets because the Post delivered our load to the Seinäjoki River!
We'll get more when Post gets the load!
So unless there was traffic in the lawn mowing, it was on the sign.
The sign that foxes its shop is linked to the fact that last spring Post expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The lawnmower is serving the Post until the end of August.
Fairy thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
The media have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this is incredible, and Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia managed to grab her own favorites in a bag of candy, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who was responsible for the company's transport services business in Post, regretted the damage to evening-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to sub-delivery (Salo) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told the evening-saying.
This is the first story to be reported by the Evening News.
Teija Haltia was not indignant at the sign because she found all of her own candy cutters in the selection.

The Backlund before and after photo couple has collected a number of commendable comments from the people's condensers.
You're great.
We're on the same road, a lot of motivation!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Project Do It Now.
Your pictures give me a lot of strength and enthusiasm when I'm on the same journey myself, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Let's do it now" project.
At the time, he told the evening paper that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was 10 kilos away.
In the course of a three-month fitness course, there were finally five pounds down.
The wish of the wife's family murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hoped that the victim would be remembered for a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
The Sipoo Veterinary Department has published a Facebook update to convey the victim's family's wishes for donations to police dogs.
In the publication it is reported that the victim had been employed as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinarian station and had also completed his carer training there.
The vet station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, funny and not afraid of work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to the police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe clothes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have told the evening paper that the victim was a very dear animal.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening state of arrest.
However, the stock market survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post to breach of the Equality Act
The postal service had no right to withhold the salary of a non-familiarisation worker, assessed by the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The district court obliged Post to pay the worker most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of his salary corresponding to his share of the day's work.
According to the District Court, in breach of the Equality Act, the worker was placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Association Decision of the Union for Posts and Logistics on the ban on education.
During last year's November postal bill, PAU made a decision that Post's employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
The news of the people first told me.
Returning Turkey to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights, writing to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their response to the Journalist Alliance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipila and Soin to express their concern for Turkish freedom of expression and of the press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of freedom of expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration - in place of the Estonian-based Vaino
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
This will be the grandson of Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old ex-diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin Communication, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will take over special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked to be reassigned and proposed to replace Vaina, "says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
A lot of people thought Ivanov was a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition into a game ban - cannot be seen in the opening of the League of Valioliga
The world record man for football moves is not seen in the field when the British League of Whites is kicked in this weekend.
Paul Pogba's prohibition of gambling followed along to England.
Manchester United's gigantic acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of the ban when ManU opens its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, told BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba as an Italian society to Juventus.
However, the English football union FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left with a ban on Juventus.
He got two warnings last season in the Italian cup, and it's gonna be a one-game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England. The FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when the ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the artists on the main stage is the punk-legend Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is staged with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind this success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's kind of unusual to think like this when it comes to the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of 70,000 visitors in the last year by 5,000.
The festival will see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance the work.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered along huge paths.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinking bars in a partially artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, 15 000 people's tent is the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a bit of a grandeur, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done to Kallio is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creamy things," like building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
Above all, we want to stand out on the substance.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit in with Flow's world of value: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan group in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at the festival that combines inindirock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we'll see this at a gig in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - the tourists fled in horror
The Hua Hin blew up local time on Thursday night with two bombs.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumuran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wild animal protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't get a good look at the tweet, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hint were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had gone off at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favoured by Finns.
No one was killed, apparently.
Meanwhile, there was another double bomb attack at Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police say they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken over the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KML: This part of the new stand-by forces will first go into battle in a war situation
In the event of an acute war, the armed forces will not be ordered to engage in battle until several months after the oath has been taken, "says the Central Finnish.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the military armed forces serving for 5.5 months, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve members of the stand-by forces are first appointed.
None of the garrisons or the reservists are ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became clear that the Defence Forces will start training the armed forces in the immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations even during training as a garrison.
Pamela Tola got a huge refund for the mold house.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, the house revealed a serious problem of moisture, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in financial losses for Tola and Warma amounting to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the district court and in the court of court.
The court of appeal gave judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse a couple's legal and settlement expenses for a total of EUR 47 344.
The right made the price reduction slightly reasonable, as some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known by the buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building faults that had occurred were substantially more serious than those which had been put forward.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report were not harmful.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainfall and melting water running along rock courses.
However, the discussions did not reveal that there was any urgency at all.
Tola and Waroma were under the impression that rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which was reported by witnesses to be due both to the rainfall of the rock and to the capillary increase in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial polluted air was also allowed to enter the interior via the porch, according to the inspector's assessment.
A mould or yeast that would allow a healthy risk, above the limit values, was found in brush samples from the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window napper and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also argued whether the apartment had been extended in breach of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes had been made to the dwelling in breach of the permit prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warma felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal finds in its judgment.
Creepy archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter on how documents on microfilms have been recorded in the US National Archives in Maryland concerning a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards originate from the National Racial Office in Nazi Germany.
The Breed Agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The National Board of Breed looked into women's background, including through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency the hand-written biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Breed Office wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who were very good at German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the records.
SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether in marriage or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the site of the US Holocaust Museum is described.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting the acquisition of children.
The German mother's honour card was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
Siren the Tickler's sixth, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko was third in the first race of the Finnjoll day to sail at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained at the top of his tail in the second race of the day.
The weasel rose to eight in the overall situation after five races, but the failure of the second one dropped him in 14.
Wind Peterer-Siren fought RS: X-Class Day slots 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petey-Siren is the sixth.
In 470, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were in position 23 at the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgreens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded with a few hours of sleep: "I was so hung up"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was best sold by Finland as a solo artist and star of dance boards and festivals from the bartender of the cruise ship in 1995, is still able to boast and is currently in a fierce uplift.
A book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and his career in good and evil.
Sillanpää's career rose to total praise when he won the crown of the Tango King in the Seinäjoki Tangomark market in 1995.
At the competition, Sillanpää sang thong songs, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kupapäki had written a tango song to Sillanka at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: the bridge head sang it on the tape with a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from the recording of a song that had become a giant hit, that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and to be top-notch.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from its then partner and the case ended up in the texts of You earned the gold song, which was published as a single in 2014.
It says in the book that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmäse were not the same as the Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the news of Jari and his ex-beloved divorce, Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption were the reasons for it, but Jari said it was total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polls of the voting week anticipated the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutes or universities were in favour of divorce, although a couple of individual scientists might disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign by the former US President, Bill Clinton, was "It's the economy, stupid" in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they couldn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics reports responses from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently reflected.
They were particularly struck by the fairness of the BBC, which gave just as much space to a few per cent of the economists in favour of the EU separation as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in explaining the views of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters on the consequences of the distinction.
Those far-flung combinations of letters talked face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both heard and understood, then they were ignored because economists represent an elite with which voters themselves do not share any common interests.
Academics such as economists in large cities would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas was not working.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants rush your hospital, immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British man get to be a doctor if he didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children, too.
How much easier would the real British children get to have a school if they got rid of them?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were carried out by Pertti Vanhanen, Finland.
According to him, in Aberdeen, we were prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, we began to prepare for the victory of Plan B, the camp in favour of the EU's separation, in case the result was left.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds out of the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, "says Vanhanen about Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Old Man, the standard would be 15-20%.
At the time, the value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Thus, real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp for the EU broke up won, Europe became a mess.
However, the two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite calm, "says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he felt that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, these people robbed the situation and put it in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, "says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation because of the cash collected, but it had to freeze its trade for six days in the end.
According to the Elder, they did not actually close down the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be withdrawn in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you do not have to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most people canceled the ad.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, "says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the European Union funds in Aberdeen.
But there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention for real estate funds
Mr Vanhanen felt that the closure of real estate funds' transactions received an excessive amount of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures dominate approximately four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen closed down for six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be "blatant" from the point of view of Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, Mr Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is at its weakest for 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought down the London real estate market.
At 2: 00 in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at 4: 00, when Pertti Vanhanen, the manager of the property investments of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word for it.
I realized that this is going to side with Plan B, "says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed straight for work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the night.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office gave the news a boost, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display terminals were blinking red.
It was one of those mornings that you never thought you'd live, "says Vanhanen.
It is not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, "says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market started to anticipate severe bills on the British real estate market, especially in London.
As many as 20% of the office buildings in London were expected to be negative in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the storm has gone down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much remains to be said: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The CBRE Real Estate Service Company's data on price developments cover approximately one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the minus was collected, and Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have there been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same drops hit crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, moreover, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began on the US property market.
Mr Vanhainen feels that the comparison is not entirely correct, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
It's a different atmosphere.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that in the past, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You can find your money, too.
The repair shop could have been in the way anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of buildings in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have been saying that the city, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started at a very high altitude.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class that becomes globalised, says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less used than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Spread out, spread out
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, "says Vanhanen.
Aberde also began to lighten his holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's coming.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
A lot of things he's not afraid to judge, but he says there's hardly any spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or even going ahead.
The old man has seen several shops up and down, because he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can get away with it.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have distributed, the risks are also distributed, "says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register shopping information more closely
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group today announced that it will start collecting more detailed information on the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the information has been collected so far from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to apply for the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group comes here after Kesko, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data will be collected with the agreement of the customer and will be used for marketing under authorisation.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, "says Riitala to the Financial Messages.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to the grocery shopping alone.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for marketing targeted at the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are only collected from K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not release their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer programme and such a programme is not planned for this period.
In Finland, the local store has its own customer loyalty program called "First Bonus," which can be associated with selected houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group level data, we stick to the balance of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on which day, as well as the customer's receipt, the final amount.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not permit the registration of product information.
Initially, the experiment
The customer owner and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
Basic data have included not only personal and address data but also professional, educational, housing and birth years and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total purchase and method of payment have been saved from the S-Front Card purchase.
In addition, the data of the S-bonus partners are derived from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
By contrast, in S-markets, Prismos, Home Terror and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be targeted more closely, "says Marjaana Saarikoski, the customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they'll be reporting a change to their customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored at the cashier's offices in any case, whether they want to or not.
A willing person can check his or her stored information on the S-Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs's newest dog confirmation - the puppy will be the first exploding dog
The black labrador's cub sniffs fiercely five similar boxes lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle drawer.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing with that favorite toy.
The box that Heila was sitting next to revealed a jar of casings that were smelling gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online commerce
Heila is Customs's first specialist in the search for weapons and explosives and will be stationed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job as the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures in Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, "says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second main reason for training an arms and explosives dog for Customs's tasks is the postal services through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 findings related to the purchase of weapons, arms parts, ammunition and explosives at Helsinki Airport, as well as their precursors, from online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports it will be a great advantage in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require further research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of arms and explosives dogs will be carried out in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in the church moor
The Heila puppy's education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila with police and military experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells they teach Heila to identify.
Heila will always be further trained as necessary, "says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs's six drug dogs as well as the Money and Drug Dog Massi.
The Labrador Reaper, Heila, has been selected from the ten puppies' litter.
The criteria for selecting a dog to choose from at the airport include bellyaching and hunting, as well as tranquillity, as the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go home without Heila. Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the evening-message says that he loses to a fast dog the protection of the camera's mike, but Heila returns the protection that looks like a soft toy right away from the "get off" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen on the job site at Helsinki Airport in the next half of next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to ironing the work vest on top of the dog, remind Suntio.
One working dog costs around EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from 8 to 10 hours, but active work rates can last from only 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
The owner of the heila was applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold Rugby of Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued that the government has set 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the Earth Broadcasting Corporation, the Fiji Government confirmed this once the championship was completed.
The day off is the day after the team returned home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian tells us that in the country the final was followed in the capital of Suva, where the stadium had a screen set up.
Normally only native Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times editor Majes Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish crane fainted after a fierce performance
The weight-lift Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a tough battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for a lift.
During or immediately after the severe lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got 175 kilos of employment in Rio and 145 kilos for the stroke.
He had 200 pounds in common.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as did the other one.
With the third attempt, the weight rose with the fierce screaming.
The body was trembling under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The satisfaction of the Finnish lifeguard was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Leadership League - Evening-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the men's football league, has made a deal with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa for the rest of the season.
We are looking for a top player on our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than ten players from all over the world.
And gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, and RoPS coach Juha Malinen told us in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPssi, Florida, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovaniemites will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threat Modern Family Star once again shakes: Teenage Star shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, who is known as Alex Dunphy in the modern family comedy series, blinks again by presenting his daring body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only exposed the actor's legs, but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behaviour to a much more courageous one.
The star has posed in his social media photos in very few clothes and has taken many tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very few costumes.
Winter on the threshold of adulthood has recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his profile so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child's star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life and he's grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started out in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has displeased some of his long-standing fans with his image transformation.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman at Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to many women, glowing a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start northern lights from the beginning of the autumn, "Visit Finland explains in the newsletter.
The main destinations of the Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly linked to heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for northern lights in Lapland during winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and goes on to the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times as fairy, says Anne Lind, the marketing manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group for the Northern Lights campaign in Finland is rich Japanese women aged between 25 and 35 who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University and from Turku and Tokyo Universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lind, Northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased clearly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, "Lind says.
Britain is content with rugbyhopea, as Fid's master course leads to gold.
The impressive progress of Great Britain in the rugby tournament collapsed in the final challenge posed by Fiji in the Thursday evening finals when the team experienced 43-7 crashes at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a master's course at the hearing, chewed, evaded, in a game of support, running lines, and still in power when he won gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby opening tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semifinals played earlier on the same day in South Africa may have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, in this condition, Fidi would have won a top-class team of 15.
Perhaps - but probably not - Britain can be comforted by the fact that at least one British man will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former boss of England from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, trained by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they only lost one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Mr Fidi began with an excellent start in the fight against British tampas for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the finish line.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremaluu scored at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... in the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravoisnuu crashed through British loose tackle and rushed to the line to make a goal.
After the touchdown, the score was 29-0 on the break.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's actually the way it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes during the break that blocked the Fid dam... for an entire four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal after the impressive Fid feed game.
Dan Norton scored for the UK when he scored in the left corner of the touchdown and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyous approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute paint had frosting in Fid's cake that didn't need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the fidians hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier on the same day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semi-finals, where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling footwork and scored under the goal posts in the second half.
A great late hit from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15-Asian rugby team in England, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer was a thrill for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's rowing victory.
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard ridges towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they rowed together, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the two of them raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's couple contest - the first women in the history books of British sports that reach such an achievement.
Their rule was perfect, and this was their 39th performance undefeated, which is also record.
This is what we see, two great athletes gliding on the surface with swan supremacy, not entirely depicting the nature of victory.
The background to each row is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day after having had a cancer diagnosis.
Like he said, it was a close one.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the period when they caused as little interference as possible - if that term can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thoughts of the couple were Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to handle his own nervous system.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment of Afghanistan, said: "I've been a tunneling this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he deserves a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race for five years.
The couple set a heavy rhythm that their competitors couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in the warehouse.
We were very attached in the moment.
Helen yelled, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good row and a race, and we did.
A couple wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover's gonna be at the wedding next month when he gets married to Steve Backshall, the TV adventurer.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was so stressed out.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better, "he said.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will hold the premature parliamentary elections called for by protestors who have been ravaged by the Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's last spring's rage will affect the results of the autumn elections.
In June, there was a clear criticism of those in power in the presidential elections, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, a presidential candidate for the Republicans of the United States, withdrew his latest atrocities.
He said that he was being sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President, Barack Obama, was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and involved in the establishment of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious by what they said and demanded an apology from Trump.
The commander in chief of the army should never let anyone who could sink down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-favoured burkin bathing suit on the beaches, says among other things the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swimming to anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which emphatically express religious links, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice, while a 31-year-old man drove to the celebration of French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - the blue-algae amplitude in Lake Läkösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-leaved amplitude has been observed at the lake of Lüökösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took samples of water from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the beach of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters of all bathing areas were below the time limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal concentrations in the seawater of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
However, under favourable conditions, the situation may quickly turn into blue algae blossoms, resulting in the formation in ferries of blue green seaweed on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
In the event of a blue seaweed opacity becoming blue seaweed blossoms, the bathing area shall also be notified separately on the bathing water declaration board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes proposed by the Ministry of Finance next year's budget proposal.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the change of the forest area.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is a good one, commented Juha Hakrainen, Director of Forestry at the Central Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the brittle finds criticism of the proposed tax change.
A reduction in the amount of the forest gift is proposed for the net capital income of the owner of the forest.
It is the capital income deducted from all other deductions.
According to MTK and Kakurainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of the wood.
The VM's proposal starts with a reduction in the net capital income of forestry that prevents it from resulting in a loss of capital income from forestry that would be deducted from other taxes.
A person like this would get a tax heist, even if they didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, "says Hakraainen.
In addition, he said that only a small proportion of forest owners were affected by the model.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in Kakurainen's mind.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of growing the size of the holding.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been reduced for decades according to Kakurainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail of fury caught the motorists at the Himanga, two cars derailed into a ditch and crashed into each other.
The Kalajoki Himanga had a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars driving in a row derailed into a ditch, and then the one in the back came running after the driver.
Harri Hähtiä, the day-old firefighter, said that the fall into the ditch was suspected to be due to a severe hail.
There were two people in the car behind the car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more details on their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the above was not injured.
The accident took place on Highway 8 from the Himanga a few miles to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers from the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the study group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of cancer increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatment may be improved by focusing on cancer cells in addition to interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications Journal in the field of cellular biology.
Muhos's family home death continues in court, the prosecution also demands a murder sentence against another perpetrator.
Muhos's family home death continues in court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for the death of a family in Muhos.
The second received eight years of 4 months for, among other things, a murder as a young person and an aggravated robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The Taposta convict was also convicted of serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The district court judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, by the plaintiffs and by the man who was sentenced to a tougher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a lesser sentence for a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a director of a child protection unit at a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder assaulted a director sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had gotten out of his grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a psych report, both convicted persons were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrate, growing only at 156.
The world's longest living backbone has been confirmed by an ice shark, a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, the holler, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The fact that it only grows one centimeter a year increases my life expectancy.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The scientists found out about the age by radio-carbon timing.
Because of the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest age was estimated at 392 years - although one way or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economist - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular through tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
It would leave a really huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Health reform in Barack Obama needs to be reconsidered.
The administration must be appointed "experts rather than bureaucrats."
According to Trump, "destructive" commercial policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be penalised by 45% and Mexico by 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
American, not global, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his own intentions, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organised protests.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump program leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early on Friday in Finnish time.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is a disaster, but the actual tsunami strikes in the middle of the streets of Madrid - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's story of novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Travelers (2013) was a small-time and grumpy satirical comedy, a pre-existing skin where I live (2011) Spanish career peaks.
On a level basis, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a chauvinese serenity drama of love, relationships and family, with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of it.
The story is simple, and we see much of it as a long flashback.
Life seems to be a model for middle-aged nominee (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will rise to the second leading woman, who is familiar with the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a thorn, but I myself would say that it was quite a clever and literally a one-off sweep.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Juliet to such a characteristic flagrant.
It is a strongly played, restrained, place in places with good music and quite sad-minded film, where it contains ingredients in elegance.
Instead, the visual colours typical of the Spanish director are still present, and so that it slowly begins to put into the eye more as a pure formality than as a functioning dramatic power tool.
The people in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or, otherwise, only sudden losses, but the surface remains as rough.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise on these issues, but the main point, that is to say, the tone of the scene does not improve much.
In a mechanical repetition, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro awarded at Nobel in 2013.
The Novells have been published in the book The Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly even-thick literary film.
There would have been emotionally unparalleled elements in even more dramatic drama, that much of the big stuff - especially the deafening guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Direction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government is trying to make an election - People's News
There will be no further cuts, the saying ministers, so that the Finns of basic Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out by scavenging.
There will be no further surgery.
The 4 billion savings that have already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Minister for Finance Petteri Orpo (co-ed) are convinced of the budget crisis.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because social security cuts were already decided in the spring's frame work.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment protection and almost all other benefits linked to national pensions will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
The municipal elections haunt us.
Why do ministers stress so massively that there will be no further cuts on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the polls tell us that the government party's primary Finns are facing a slump loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, basic Finns received 752 new councillors, many of whom will be realised in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of approximately equal parties rests on the fact that the heel of the Finns is holding.
Now it has not lasted; more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the attendance of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and, second, they will try to soften the attack waiting for the Finns to come.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different... if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The government has set itself the objective of reversing debt in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo draft budget will take over EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not broken down or even slowed down.
The other is to hold on to the program.
This means new, even harder cuts on the former in 2017 budget strife.
The budget would at least push close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring elections will receive what comes.
These measures did not help to bridge the debt gap.
It is quite clear that the current measures did not break down debt, despite Juha Sipilä's attempts to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki's budget at the press conference prove this irrefutable:
The global economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal to the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary recovery policy in the early 2010's.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Questionnaire: People want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of the KKS-Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, secondary school education and waste management to the individual municipality.
The responsibility of the region, for its part, is most clearly sought through the provision of regional education, specialist medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the functions entrusted to the municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
The underage drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol out on the Ilomantsin Road on Friday night at half past one.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man went to drive the police away from fair speeding.
The chase continued on the Sonkajanrannantee, from which the Sorronahontee and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, a young man ran running away, but a faster cop ran off to catch a fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Kavintie on Thursday night at 9: 15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue department pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above it, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
A crashed truck dripped into the road with hydraulics oil sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An old woman disappeared this afternoon in Ilmajoki.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoen Lahdenkylä in South Ostrobothnia.

Major accident material in the air - see photo gallery about the destruction of Paraphest
The crash current that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestyistus, estimates that the festival will be able to get on its feet financially, and the event can also be arranged next year.
At the end of Friday night, Kalle Salonen, the last performer of Paraphest, performed on the market platform.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations at the city theatre premises starting at 1: 00.
The Art Center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition between 1: 00 and 15: 00.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The burst current is generated in a thunderstorm cloud when the rain water and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the status of thunderstorm water bind heat and therefore the falling air mass cools and its velocity towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Finnish Meteorological Institute that several downflows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash currents.
The crash stream hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Paraphest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5: 00.
Three tents fell over, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child, who was transported to follow-up treatment with a minor injury.
Air pollution ages London people.
According to a study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than, for example, an elderly fellow living in rural areas.
Small particles aging the skin are a very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of almost 9,500 London people every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for London residents who walk on their way to work in close proximity to congested streets.
The inhabitants of London may try to protect themselves against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The brakes on the tractor let down a man standing in front of him.
A man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor still pushed him enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injuries.
The tractor couldn't have gone any further because it ran into the rocks in front of it.
The rush to the season to come with new power
The League-Riento, a river-mouth player in the volleyball Championships, is going on a series that starts in October from a better starting point than that of a man's memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when Rienno's beginnings have been dark.
Jani Säisi, who continues to be Rienno's head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, the centralists Fred Musoni will start his second season in Rienna.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on the Rwanda national team is a six-foot-tall hacker.
Garchet is a passport, and the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Josba, Katja and the River Boys to the United States National Team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all the alibiandy World Cup since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada since being better at the North American Qualifications.
I used to work in Turku and play with women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was about to set up a country team for the Taliban.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppan, 48, says.
Jomppanen was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jomppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was not yet a sport played at SM level like alibandy.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey series, Juppänen remembers.
Jomppanen played the Salibandyn SM series with the University during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
When he was playing, he trained the "A" girls at the club for the championship.
Women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jomppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, with a balance of 169 matches 51 + 34 = 85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoisian-oriented Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play at the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old, has played this game before six men's ground matches, where he has accumulated a total of power points of 9 + 4 = 13.
The 32-year-old defenseman Tatu Väänänen of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen has recovered from the thigh and is part of the standard equipment of the national team with 117 ground matches.
Mika Koponen was also appointed to the national team, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salimbymaa team is Petri Kettunen, a contender.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is quitting as a Beach Volley player at least after the current season.
The Beach Volley Finnish Championship will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
Within three days, medals are played in both adult and adolescent series.
In cooperation with Kouvola volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of each series will be eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY, raised by Essi Hasu, who has been at the beach volley peaks in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu, living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the pesistadium.
I haven't been in adult shows in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals around the house.
The region of Kouvola lit the spark of Hasu into sport and gave good lunches for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of childhood in mind.
When I was nine, I started volleyball at the E-girls at Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the head is too big a jersey, knee pads on the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreography after a point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team's spirit created an environment in which it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved, and our teammate's dad was coaching us, and our mom was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior season a natural choice of species to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
A song has been played on the beach of the Kärämälammi since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior Ski Tour part-competitions, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen in the SM finals at the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-punished duo in the tournament has a clear goal.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still don't have the gold SM in the trophy cabinet, but Hasu throws in riddles.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, there are new challenges to civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toenails will be put on the nail at least temporarily, and Hasu is planning.
The crash stream knocked over tents at the event of disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was near

Solomon Koli boldly went into agriculture
Agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Kol began their activities as a continuation of their home state.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking a debt and increasing the volume so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into play.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard water, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to go along with the project and I have been fully involved in it, Mr Koli says and adds that if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who is growing meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results because Solomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He'll be able to vote on the newspaper's website until 9 / 9 / 8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since last October, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate was -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been an inspiration to the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits Roy Licherini's painting.
Lens are simple tools that twist facial features and produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for the application to advertise blackface mask or favour bleached skin color as a gift for beauty.
So when Snapchat advertised some users this week with a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow-face" or "yellowface."
And they're wondering if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's bigger problem in terms of diversity.
The news and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of the Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Some of them vehemently denied an animation comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet on photographs was widely shared, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with a side-by-side gross Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degradability.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the fraternity conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racial youth audience may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
The 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed."
Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to withdraw his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu mainly criticised the company's white male management and ended his writing with hashtag # DeleteSnapchat (# Delete Snapchat)
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which makes them able to make decisions of this kind," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak directly. "
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint which Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, referring to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to the representative, some time ago the company hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented population and to take internal integration efforts forward.
For their part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it true that they need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials falsified Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that the authorities of the United States Military Command headquarters modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Isis than what was justified by events on the ground.
The interim report of the Working Party set up by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Appropriations Sub-Committee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among the headquarters intelligence analysts who said that their superiors were tampering with their estimates of American efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Cencom, is the military headquarters of the military branch in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by the higher-ranking Cencom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified, which were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community agents," said the press release of the report.
"The events of Cencom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to senior decision-makers," said Mr Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The failure of the management of Cencom goes right to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail persistent problems in the description and analysis of headquarters in the United States of America's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-level administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it seems that the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Cencom leaders to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, Isis, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from headquarters to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Cencom authority publicly stated that a major attack on Mosul could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," represented by Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas, said in the statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders of the US Military Action Headquarters manipulated the HQ intelligence outputs to mitigate Isis' threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working party after having heard that the analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an ongoing investigation into the Central Intelligence Agency.
On Thursday, the members of the House of Representatives's Committee of Inquiry published their own findings, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Cencom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment between Isis and Iraqi security forces," Mr Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democrat, said in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "extended the publication of intelligence outputs', worsened the mood among analysts and did not" give enough room for diverging perspectives'.
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House was trying to put pressure on Cencom's analysts to reconcile their conclusions with "predetermined or political narrative."
The Daily Coast will report Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector has begun an investigation following complaints from the analysts at Cencom.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions than the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claims).
Last year's accusations called into question how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of the military activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reflects a dispute over a decade ago when the Cencom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that, despite objections from several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the uprising regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The then commander of Cencom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators regarded his testimony to the Senate as an overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in the women's field hockey, holding an interlude with Britain
The day after having scored three goals on the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday the first two goals of the US women's field hockey team when the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but a 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But this he knows: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation at the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still undefeated after winning on Thursday Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams have made it through the quarter series, and this game will determine who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
The first to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group leader, a little longer at the beginning of the quarterly finals.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have stirred up their surprise success here, four years after they were the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played in Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player of all time.
He was not at the 2008 Olympic Games because he could not be included in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace in London as we do now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time goal with a knuckle-down close to the goal.
India had entered the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in 1-0 numbers until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then he circled to the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 wire.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the final goal.
This zero game was the first American goaltender to Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be continuing and inevitable, a fierce message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of a neighbor in the queue of a café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time and future heart crusher of the Olympic Games with a smile, could well be one of the names everyone knows at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-minded TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the centre, partly in the shade, are the species that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast. Long live it.
But if I may make a reasonable number on my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the contained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it first performed in the Sydney Games, there have been so few observations in the past 16 years that many of whom I interviewed did not realise it was an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share women's medals for men, Chinese and Canadian.
This year, the Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medals.
Trampoline, however, has a certain allure of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympic Games in an uncivilised ear.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an airless fan.
There are possibilities for amusement in the species, as we can see from the vibrations of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but there is also the fineness of gymnastics and swimming, two species which are basically combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín," which means a springboard.
The champions jump up to almost 30 feet with a giant trampoline, and they have to perform rolling series (translations, folds and folds) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those who wish for a medal must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
Not only do they hunt for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another grotesque border: world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and it can even make a spectator cry.
But that's also why watching the races can be a little exhausting.
The trampoline offers a rest period for this.
Trampoline's heading up.
The objective is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, seemingly without weight as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no raging rush towards the end, no jump into the distance, just a sleepless, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as we can get at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 1: 00 p.m. (ET), men's races will also come Saturday at 1: 00 p.m.
The NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 2: 00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by providing male athletes to stare and objectify (as the American male gymnasts suggested some time ago according to the Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan kingdom.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protestors calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced the violent opposition of the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, demonstrations against the government have shaken the country as it spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a radical political change.
According to the human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The spread of videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, shows how the security authorities hit young people with sticks while they were forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries value its stability.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country will receive that much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously and the capital of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about the repression of the government, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you stifle people and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All young people show their minds.
One generation is showing their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the acts of strangulation of the coalition governing land use.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies also received the last post held by the opposition and now holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the struggle along this tight and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over recent years, can try to use the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why after years of turbulence, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first one seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location via hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, are better connected.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the amphibians, coming from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, taking advantage of the oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is about to change, too.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oro Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the amhara and oro regions.
Many amharas and oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people. The population covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, the intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to discredit opponents.
"The current administration does not have that kind of basic instinct," Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unfamiliar to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by Tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a state of turmoil in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been robbed by the government first and then robbed.
In the ensuing attack, many demonstrators died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest went away relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the Ethiopian leaders for their vision of infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and for their considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal contempt of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in the city of Amhara in Gondari attacked companies owned by Tigres, and anti-Tigren hate is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it said a while ago that it had closed this base.
Although Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not already want their ally in an unstable area to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is a real balance."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-founded Isis claim to "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign, having taken over the dispute on Friday, by claiming that he was not serious when he repeated this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have been grasping to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain comments which he does not necessarily mean.
After the insinuations made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday, Trump claimed the same with increasing enthusiasm during Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
Early Friday morning's Twitter release Trump, however, said that he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a full translation of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump make his point by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took his hearing ears.
The latest review storm comes in the context of Trump's renewed efforts to focus his campaign in the midst of declining opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
Fleeing to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he faced a wide-ranging criticism, apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying 'of course I am sarcastic'.
This approach will allow Trump to make a political speech at the borders and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then" clarify "one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of softening his speeches for a big vote, Trump has been even more gallant in the last few days, with his popularity continuing to fall.
A new survey published on Friday in the NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist showed that Trump is a major player behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally tries to avoid apologies for the provocative things he has said, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faced an ever closer examination during the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his observations are.
The former Mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to a lot of trouble defending the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe there are real political comments in his words," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the truthfulness of Trump's argument that Obama and Clinton were setting up an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which grind every word of his word and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to figure him out, saying, "They're not gonna make it!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new piece of evidence that he was unfit to be president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the alley on Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soap dishes in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in a city to be rehabilitated.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also an invention.
The revived verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new verb has a Wi-Fi and you can pay with credit cards, but part of the staff is still the same and has the same unrefined atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same way.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try.
He brought in new ingredients.
There are bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are capers and roasted onions on the covers.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer in the cafeteria anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the cafeteria.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up on the coffee scheme for a while.
"I understood I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a chai drink mixed instead of his usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly as a clock, I went in and they were making spicy bagels with butter," he said.
The photo. Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes, because of the variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Chers offered to prepare a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient in the coffee shop's cold-extracted coffee.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up soon at a point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the building next door.
For many customers, it's enough that they get their old favorites in the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was inconsolable when the place was closed down.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he'd come home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I missed getting to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depression food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue cuisine, such as the goose liver steward, and the Maryland swamp turtle soup.
On that day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they will meet the journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the region of Fatiron, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock exchange collapse.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression period.
"The troubles were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made of ingredients and some cheap ingredients that continued the actual ingredients.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make your dinner.
Coe was grinning.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in his stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-as-as-as-you-can-pick-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal crowned the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for the Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
As distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery species, such as crumbs and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," said Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been at the centre of American meals for years, became a sparingly administered luxury product.
Specialist compositions were tested when calorie levels and nutrient levels were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
When doing research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an age course in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," said Coe.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Domestic experts such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to become "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of converting blended spaghetti and carrots into delicious doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic tastes.
Particularly tasty are the reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat the cake attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood with simple, iowa country food, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire who had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gold dining room.
He was out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the eating habits during the recession were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Our heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman said, "He even made people sick."
There was an incident with the wind farm.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," said Ziegelman, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a name that looked like it.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all accidentally sunk their spoons in a sticky, brown clutch.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once, and he did it twice.
Sounded like a positive budgetiser, he told his wife, "a little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for his legal expenses in the fight against the hepatitis C patent against Merc.
The US engagement sensor has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the legal expenses it incurred in the case of the hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments for their violation of two of Merck's patents relating to Gilead's success drugs Sovaldi and Harvo. This exemption followed the discovery by an American judge of Merck's abuses involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment lodged on Thursday, the US engagement judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can cure clearly more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of the active substance in Gilead's medicine, the laboratory work at the bottom of sofosbuvir.
US-sponsored troops say they've taken full control of the Manbij controlled by Isis.
After the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday that the troops supported by the United States have taken over the northern city of Manbij, which is close to the Turkish border.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages, held captive by fighters, from the Allied Corps of Sharfan Darwish SDF, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democrat presidential candidate and his / her spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton Group donated a million dollars to charitable organisations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speakers' allowances, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster in his book on his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in the statement.
As a steep contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for the US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
The Newyork businessman Trump and his lawyers have invoked the audit of the tax administration as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sam, said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns of the candidate for democracy.
On Thursday, special assistant to Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including Mitt Romney, President of the Republicans of 2012 and other Republican Collages, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business activities and numerous other ties with Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem by publishing a online video on Friday, highlighting the visible Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business column borrowed numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after a billionaire investor named Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Omaha in Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an audit of the tax administration and that Trump is not "afraid" of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
At present, the true federal rate of taxation of Clinton, which is based in Chappaqua, in New York was around 32% between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an inexpensive, indexed investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilli powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephant
Nature guardians in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from migrating to human settlements - they throw chilli powder-filled condoms at animals.
The way has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and hundreds without hurting animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed... tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities, which are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without damaging them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeygui.
The first two steps include showing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, let's throw the so-called "chili cloud."
The condom shall be filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and a firecracker, followed by a twisting of the condom so that only the fuse is visible.
When a condom is ignited, it explodes and bursts chilli powder dust into the air.
One fragrance is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks make a loud, bright explosion.
RT news: The Jewish filmmaker criticised the Berlin hotel which removed Israel's area code at the request of the Arab people
A French, Jewish filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to Arab customers' "requests'.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, disproved his frustration at the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to find a list of countries on the list of countries offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was "shocked him."
The hotel receptionist said it was a "deliberate decision of the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's heading number," said Lanzmann.
The Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But the more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We wait for the hotel to come to the right conclusion, "said the official.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave in" to the alleged requirements of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another publication, pointing out that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendam street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "unattention" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the fast-track list was never made," Kempinski's representative said according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds.
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when students gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems started when law enforcement tried to break up the student force, which led the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to Mr Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of Sao Paolo's State, just under 100 public schools would be closed down, and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protestors started to move in as one of the troops to support President Dima Rousseff, who was arrested while the Senate of the country voted on his charges.
RT business: Russia-Iran trade is growing sharply 71%
Since the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, says the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bi-directional cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5%, amounting to a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth in trade was achieved by supplying machines, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, this year, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also, for the first time, among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will break," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner crashed into the finish line when the British picked up the bike gold.
Callum Skinner of Scotland praised the men's team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night, when the three of the British team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was rehabilitated, and the legend was proud of the young man when he got to the finish line, taking advantage of the winning advance from the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after having placed modestly sixth in March's track race in the World Cup in London, even though Hoy has since ended his competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's closure also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held onto in relation to the Scottish potential, which is now behind us.
Hindes, Kenny... who won Hoy's championship four years ago... and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was a little behind after his own tour, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes' drive at a larger speed, so that he could slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindex's attention as they entered the trophy.
A 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hides admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the British competitors have not complained.
This time there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hides said, "It felt like he was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bicycles in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's condition, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's heroism, the victory of three Olympic gold in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (apparently on that sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have the total number of medals going up to six gold and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next race is in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one.
The team competition is always the best.
You win it with your friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely. "
Hides said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the title of knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Dull were in time the fastest four-person, four-mile team chase.
Their time was 3: 51: 943.
The world record winning gold in London 2012 is 3: 51: 659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the time periods when the officials invited him for the length measurement.
In the corresponding women's contest, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Sand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time when the clock stopped at 4: 13: 260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track-cycle team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and achieve a whole series of medals.
Having presented truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been understated before the Rio Games.
There has been a drama, the least of which has not been the resignation of the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April because of the charges of sexuality and bullying, and the end of the career of large people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first-night races in the biking stadium, it seems that Britain's present legendary reputation could once again be the case at a perfect time.
Portland's defrosted future as a result of cutting the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Victoria Aluminium smelting plant, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the factory's owners is in the process of concluding a distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut off.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria administration that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be continued.
The aid period for a period of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be in danger at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelting plant uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows for several years the speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been caused by the price of production of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the other three owners to close their contracts.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and the Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity needs of the non-melting plant will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "hedging agreements' which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period and will therefore actually expire in 2017.
"For this reason AGL expects the contracts to be profitable for the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All potential outcomes for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already "in anticipation of the end" reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by USD 187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's... ability to maintain the melting process or to secure the supply of non-melting electricity."
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it was due to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert both to the closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, AGL's CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts a year.
"If both plants leave the market, this represents a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
As an electricity producer to us, this would not be a good thing, "he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, model and mother-manager, is on the cover of the US Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand messenger and was a model in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of people I love made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or perhaps only Kardashian-style?), handwritten reality video, with the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, and involving everyone's favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but ended in a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
It is a cliché plot of almost every children's TV series "birthday season" (Seacrest says the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-drawn bunny), but Krisin had to somehow get her other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to a new Kardashian era with the place of September Vogue.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's lawsuit first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is a very special category.
The September number of Vogue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more similar to the coffee table than the fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832-page puree last year had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that, for the last two years, images of the newspaper have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities" on the cover who act as models than "celebrities."
The Oscar winner and Ambassador of Dior Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's honorary seat.
But if Jenner, who the newspaper describes as the "model of success" of his generation, were to hit the first category, he would be in quite a good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or real-life stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
In his true TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be difficult.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid calling them "the present-day bitch."
This feeling came back to the surface with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a reality star.
160 000 people are turned away every year by Community legal centres
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable will be turned away from the Community legal centres each year, as the sector prepares itself for the impact of further financial cuts on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and similar things - are already being turned away when they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services that are already stretched to the Community's extreme borders are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Community Legal Centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centres of Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need," he said.
People from violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and to Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the Land Government made its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was alleged to be armed with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign chief of operations in North Carolina threatened a worker in February while they were driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought by Vincent Bordin, a former software trainee for the state campaign, on Wednesday in Charlotte, the state court.
Mr Bordini said that he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realised that "it would not happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "took out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
Following a complaint to the local and regional campaign administration, Mr Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, it was stated in the application.
"Guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of the second addition" - usually understood the owners of weapons and the arsonists - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional shock.
Mr Hicks, Trump's representative, did not respond immediately to the request for comment.
The attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news company in Charlotte, reports that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just the local communities and all around London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Like before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the races and that we would be ashamed of the world.
Suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and economic growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a GBP 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget: from T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway supported by £16 billion in private money.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create the heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies that bypass advertising are "cat and mouse games" said one of the companies that produces such a programme.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog that said that users could update the software filters to prevent again advertising on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circled a new code.
In the blog, Mr Adblock's representative, Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of back-to-back battle between an open-source advertising community and its evaders has been going on since it was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertising inhibitors have become for industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in last year's Pagefair and Adobe research, which is almost four times the number that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after advertisers in computer sites, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not work in Facebook mobile applications for social networks or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer ads are still generating enough revenue to make it worth investing in this type of action.
On Tuesday, too, Facebook said that it would update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more power over how advertising is targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," the Facebook representative said in an e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She got hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several means of transport on the highway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud's police said in the statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but not all of them have yet been identified, a police officer who calls on them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
Criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's up to the DA, "Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking in the dark on the freeway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from charges of negligence in connection with the murder of a man who had hit and killed a man lying on the "A 'road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court was informed.
The Court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, drove in a legitimate manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation ', said the judge.
Anyone with information about Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had to live once
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus probably had to live once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus had a hot, water-free surface and carbon dioxide filled with an atmosphere that could sometimes have been an earth-like environment.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rate of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect it from rapid water evaporation.
The early Venus also had the advantage of a sun that was 30 per cent darker.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its day to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the newsletter.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as if it were an umbrella, protecting the surface to a large extent from the heat of the sun.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth's present temperatures.
The model produced a story about the development of Venus, similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably sometimes inhabited, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up on Avalanche's coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice-president of the hockey issue, saying that the reason was the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President / Director General of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice President and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche Hockey Affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
I have been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the views of the coach and the Deputy Director-General for Hockey Affairs must be fully consistent with those of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated as the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the victory of the central division, but Minnesota overturned Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 tie games, and the team lost five points to Wild by losing the Wild Card drop point of the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's chosen goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and delay strike
The fight against oil workers in the North Sea is being postponed because of wages, when all the parties in the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The strike against the Wood Group has been arranged randomly on the North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the process of resolving the current dispute."
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings throughout the day starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, the Wood Group cut the fees of the North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the space to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people on its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation of major labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea was essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just for a few, both in the North Sea and in the country as a whole," he said.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of investment is expected in new projects in the North Sea, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad constellation.
The last mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete list of the star speeds of the Plejad constellation.
New information will help astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at varying speeds, and how the cycles are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with the other constellations, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Reboll, researcher at the Pasadena Centre of Caltech's infrared processing and analysis in the press release.
The Plejad Starbase is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are right now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at their peak now.
With its high speed of rotation, these mature stars are pouring large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of recognisable spots such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Reboll compares stars to dancers the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Plejad ballet" we see that slow rotators are usually more massive, while the fastest rotators are usually very light stars, "Rebel said.
Because the Plejade constellation is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the star properties at rotational speeds.
"The Plejad constellation provides anchor for the rotation of the stars into theoretical models that cover both directions, younger and older," Rebel said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down to the speed of rotation and so to speak, hang their 'dancing shoes' on the nail.
Reboll and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad's speed of rotation in three articles which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
