A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
Only a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of the local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancisco Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Medical Agency.
San Francisco Police Department says they're investigating death as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the TV company ABC's KGB radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he saved the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant from being a chef six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're sorry about the big one," the congressman says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells me Frank first lived in hostels, but he finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGB station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of spending time with the family was to cook for all of us, "says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went along with the current.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was a rough diamond that shone every day, "he says.
Anyone who knows anything about this case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
The closing junior doctors are calling for further action in the field of industrial fighting.
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their union and asked for permission for further action in the dispute over a new contract of employment.
The JDC, a member of the British Medical Federation (BMA), is calling for the support of the entire government for further work-related action from early September onwards.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the Chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to the members of the JDC on Twitter saying that the government had been 'insisting' on questions which, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In the light of this, the JDC Government has voted against the new proposal for a new treaty in its entirety and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government to request permission for gradual expansion of industrial action since early September. "
Because of the dispute, junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of the BMA junior medical staff, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract that BMA had recommended.
At the meetings prior to the vote, Mr Malawana told the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, the health minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met in order to shake hands with a view to reconciliation and the formal conclusion of the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish official in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't get much heat, even with his own cautious measure.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyep Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin - five times according to a report.
I didn't keep count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper from our country wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
I personally understood his enthusiasm in the opposite direction.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the event was raging.
Putin attacked Ankara with strict words and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to regain real trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media ran a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But all of a sudden, it seemed like the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious of them were the allegations made by top officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Isis-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied these allegations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only held to allow Putin to obtain his apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a ceasefire to a firm are clear.
Above all, Mr Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed last month in a failed coup d'état.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic incentive for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter flight ban, as normally millions of Russian tourists travel annually to the Turkish coast.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take relief when air transport can finally continue.
They put their faith in a late season rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the price of fruit and vegetables has been forecast to fall by the state television when Turkish agricultural imports are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in the magazine Vedemast.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because it believes that the West has a sensual reaction to an attempted coup d'état.
Without forgetting the old resentment of the EU accession negotiations in Turkey and Putin's intervention, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool ties and break Turkish ties to the west.
There is no doubt that the Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own grievous concern about the change of power.
In this way, Russia and Turkey could, at their summit, pass on a picture of what was described by an analyst as an 'alliance of outsiders': two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created a self-image of itself as a peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between countries, while Mr Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries as to where they can seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by the NATO Member State, Turkey, when it shot down a Russian fighting machine, it is doubtless better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are at least once again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will in future only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank was forced to retreat from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategies have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors a million pounds of international sport, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more nationalist brands to enter the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be referred to as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, except for headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in place in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and that is why our staff is working for, because we are now becoming much more of a bank for different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands. "
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsoring sport.
"Now is the right time to move into a bank with different brands, because basically it is a question of how we can make the bank better for our customers," says the President-in-Office of the Bank.
"It would have been very foolish three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have introduced brands.
But our work and focus on customers' needs rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right. "
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory.
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant he won 3,000th.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3rd win at the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding the horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in a flat track running competitions.
In the past, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have been able to do the same.
Three-time master jockey Dettori, who previously won Ghayar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are all over the place because my family's here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility. "
The Dettor will receive the cheering with Predilection after his victory.
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy who won his record career over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone, which few have ever reached.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical skill is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race, his enthusiasm and narrowing has brought out supporters for years to come. "
"I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have won 6,000 races if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big ones!
To be serious, Frankie's riding career in the British Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vibrant person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey. "
Frankie Dettori ventilated his accomplishment in a distinctive way by jumping off his horse.
"From flying goals to flying downturns, Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
There's been a lot of ups and downs.
He has won a number of big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnicent Seven," but he has also survived the plane crash and has been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started, but he showed admirable character strength, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a while now, he's not about to end his career - Dettori has recently said that he wants to continue to compete until he's at least 50 years old. "
Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, suddenly dismissed his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the information provided by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration ', but the reasons for his dismissal were not given.
Mr Anton Vaino, acting as Vice-Director of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed.
The deceased, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol department and the government's office, says the Russian-speaking site of the Kremlin.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your confidence.
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring the implementation of the guidelines you have issued. "
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had asked for a divorce and recommended Vaina as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, shown by Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, particularly in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very sceptical about the official claim that a man who has been praised as a potential President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, difficult task for four years.
Now I have been the President's chief of administration for four years and eight months. "
Mr Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB of the State Security Service.
When Putin was the head of the KGB-replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
As Putin took over, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second period, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's district, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds, the star of the FBI Researchers, Thomas Gibson, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported the kicks in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, Gibson, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened, "he says in his press release.
Data on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios Bulletin.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I have put my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," says Gibson in a press release published on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show through, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans that the show could ever hope for. "
The 12th production period of the series will start in the United States on 28 September.
Mysterious landing of fish in the Banffist garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are sandeel that have been sucked into the land by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seaside, published footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
The Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry overpass and the earth bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "hillbillies," which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economic Affairs, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with over 30 000 concrete and steel being used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the bridge bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete cover in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted. "
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road cover of the North Tower, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. ground) gap.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the north side of the land bridge.
This was a massive operation, and at the same time it required a high level of precision.
Massive, because the soil has a length of 222 metres and a weight of approximately 6000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an angle of gradient of approximately 3%.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small - just a few millimetres.
I'm glad everything went well. "
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department is about the miracle rescue of three men.
The three men on their fishing boat off Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station issued an alert on Friday at 1.20 p.m. local time after its crew discovered an accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless journey without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the lifeboat to Moelfre.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately driven the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, 60-year-old, was found exhausted stuck to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It is a miracle that these three men who are on the water are still alive and well.
There was an emergency extinguishing cord on the boat's engine, but for some reason it had separated from the man who was driving the boat when the boat crashed.
They were really lucky in their journey. "
Pokémon Go yacht brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the last decade, many people have been complaining about why teenagers and children no longer go out and play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time took only watching TV, then there were video games and, last but not least, smartphones.
It is therefore great to note that technology and outdoor sports do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go craze. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later included a cartoon series, playing cards and other ancillary products).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this fell short before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for pokémon with their smartphones, which are monitored by GPS. When pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (by phone display) or "hijacked."
The wild man has pulled a generation that played a video game when they were younger and pulled their asses off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported that the Apple Watch smart watch on the Cardiff app, which discovered within two days of the launch of the game, that the number of people moving within 30 minutes per day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know which of the users is playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the raw data on the amount of physical activity.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have echoed into deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
In regular circulation, the likelihood of getting cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
In this way, it will achieve three basic things that support health - physical activity, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to even make new friends.
As usual, those of us who are part of this phenomenon also resent the spoils of joy.
And yes, someone can walk toward the door when they play.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
Because even though smart phone applications like Fitbit may have been able to monitor your activity in the past, they did not give reason to move forward, as Pokémon Go does.
The charm of novelty will disappear, and use will be reduced in due course.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase physical activity and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's scaffolding in a multi-match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
No trouble on the boom.
Chin-chin with permanta.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old scaffolding gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than his silver-based "Final Five" teammate, Aly Raisman, and the Russian bronze medalist, Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles will perform in the boom in the final of the individual competition for women's training during the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman who won the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his final totals became visible and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement leads to a completely new dimension of the species and brings him into the same category as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to his species for the last three years. He has won 15 World Cup medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest scaffolding gymnast of all time."
In Brazil, there was one last competition, above all between Biles and his own and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring for less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver rack gymnastics event at the multi-match finals on Thursday, Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11 August 2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on "i" for the going-away of Martha Karolyn, who has coordinated the national team and is now retiring.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which contains a series of volts known as his trump card, has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympia arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Already when his grandparents were little, adopting and finding Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a force figure. Boorman found her when she was on a day care tour in the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match since summer 2013 and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a perm where Biles is the defending champion of the world.
He got back to the lead after receiving 15.433 points in the beam and crowned the result by 15.933 points in the perm.
Raisman hugged him gently while they were waiting for the final points - which was just a formality - and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue glimmer of Biles when his dream of writing his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch to the competition four years ago, when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina during the rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "Grandma," was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the public after his permanto program and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fact that this 19-year-old made earlier in the week and the widespread tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
Police report three serial killers listening to music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder in ten years. The victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, says the police release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, it says.
The police suspect that the cause of the triple murder was probably not a robbery, because the attacker didn't take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the second adult victim's possession.
Speaker of the Phoenix Police Department, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether the death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
"It is common to the events that they have occurred in residential areas outside homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of the TV and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
The witness told the police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a press release on the shooting of an empty van only half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found casings and recovered fragments of the bullet from the car's seat and from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of the other peers, Edmund has a microcephaly, a congenital trifle, due to the genetic disorder of her mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I would never get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are committed to it, "he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing a child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I did not believe there was any such practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with a scooter.
Edmund didn't get up to sit down until he was 3, and he still won't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He's walking with help and riding a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and he loves to sing.
Elizabeth is introducing the sign Edmund invented, which she means "sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, this does not only mean a common sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephalia may be associated with a variety of diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how this will affect the lives of those who are affected by the Zikavirus virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying," What happens to us?
What happens to us. "
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zikavirus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you. "
Heavy rainfall and flooding caused major rescue operations in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rainfall and widespread flooding, and more rainfall in the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi are flooding their estuaries and spreading to a large area as a result of heavy rainfall.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Response Board, says that the Agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only the county of Tangipaha has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the weather service, further 76-127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, close to the Comite River Baton Rouge and near the Amite River Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weather fortune teller Alek Krautmann, many of the buildings on the banks may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding downstream in Ascension County constitutes a threat, because flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the state border of Mississippi, the Tickfast River had reached a higher level than ever on Friday at 9: 00.
The rescue work continued in the counties of Athens and Wilkinson in the south-west Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday near Gloster among those who were rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek river, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the boy who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came on a continuous pass," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had saved all three of them in a big army-style truck and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they kept their guard on Friday.
Weather reporter Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rainfall continues, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of the information received from an observer near Livingston that it had rained between midnight and Friday morning almost 350 mm.
Krautmann says that the soil was soaked strongly after the rainfall that started on Wednesday.
Authorities report that due to heavy rainfall and the flooding of streets, the inhabitants of Tangipaha County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the town council of Tangipaha had informed WWL, a subsidiary of the TV and radio company CBS, that 200 homes were under the flood.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
District leader Robby Miller says the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who were trapped in the flood.
The evacuees have been exposed to shelters in the cities of Athens and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipaha district, almost twenty streets were closed due to flooding, and the residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"Last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, Member of the City Council.
"This flood seems like a match."
In Mississippi, the rainfall continued steadily along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, "says Rupert Lacy, Rescue Director of Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported under the flood, but on Friday, none had been reported.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods, says he's been living in the Amis district for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and more rain all the time."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets in his body, will survive the shootout in Philadelphia.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told us that the boy was Mahaj Brown on CBS Philadelphia.
According to grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The kid's in critical condition at the hospital, and he's had multiple surgeries.
The family will tell the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start his first class at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men might have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault-type casings originating from different types of assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting, "said Chief Anthony Ginaldi, Chief Inspector of the Philadelphia Police.
The bullets also hit many of the buildings and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police have been told to go through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old who was shot in the city this week was a girl with a stray bullet in her hand when she played in front of her house on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic team for women's training, and there are more than one cause.
Firstly, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, this team of three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in position 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three world champions, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and masterful training programmes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in the women's individual contest in a multi-match.
Team buddy Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the species, but the same does not seem to be the case with training lessons throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as there will be only four gymnasts in the next Olympic team of scaffolding, and this will be Marta Karolyn's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private training clubs maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, appearances, competition fees, hotel fees (coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most scaffolding clubs are located in prosperous residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The training of scaffolding gymnators takes place in these clubs, and that means expensive and long-term commitment for gymnast families.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have both been coaching sport enthusiasts ever since they started scaffolding.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible training for scaffolding for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own scaffolding foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered free or affordable opportunities for training for more than 15 000 young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality scaffolding to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Bodygymnastics develops strength, tenacity and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success at school and at work.
This team has aroused enthusiasm among thousands of young girls who now want to start scaffolding, and that is absolutely wonderful.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into a prosperous, strong and successful young woman.
The junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for a new strike.
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to the remuneration and working conditions of the dispute by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Mr Hunt, the Minister for Health, told of plans to make the agreement compulsory, and said that the British public health system (NHS) was' no-one's land 'and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move on to a new agreement which will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Last night, the Chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, made a statement in which she said: "Junior doctors continue to be very cautious about the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been unwilling and sometimes unresponsive to attempts to debate.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready to take further action in the field of industrial fighting. "
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13 000 routine operations and 100 000 hours of admissions, while nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British medical professionals.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, called on junior doctors not to take any new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Work-fighting measures achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at the periphery and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
The workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector - was a sign of the seriousness of the workers, health education England in charge of health education and the Ministry of Health's desire to adhere to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May. "
During the day about 2.40 €a paying medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about 2.40 €a day, when the authorities recommended it for more people and longer-term use.
Anti-clotting medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the British Public Health System (NHS), has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is now part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has recommended that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people have a heart attack each year, one quarter of them having a heart attack or having a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and stroke is fatty matter that accumulates in the walls of the blood vessels, causing plaques.
If the plaque rips, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot falls off, it can pass along with the blood flow and prevent the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by British AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The NICE draft programme, published today, recommends that the next 90 mg of ticagrelor be administered for 12 months, then the dose should be reduced to 60 mg and aspirin given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Although effective methods of treatment are available to prevent disease progression and the development of symptoms effectively, even a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke - often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it. "
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft programme does not recommend the use of a treatment method for longer periods of time.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourished.
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Luffur Rahman, was suspended from his post last year due to corruption, which resulted in a government report.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from a widespread electoral culture in Muslim communities, revealing today's government report.
The former Minister of the Government, Sir Eric Pickles, strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to the electoral process "for the sensitivity of ethnicity and religion."
According to Pickles, the former Minister of State and the current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guards outside the polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize the fingers after voting on the indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Exhibitors should be protected more, "says Sir Eric.
He called for better access to the documents of the Government and for the decisions of the informal committees and working groups to be made by journalists.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the vote scandal in the Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that the then mayor, Mr Lufur Rahman, should resign because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman "wildly distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said "to base his campaign on the fact that every religious Muslim had a religious duty to vote for him."
Of the votes, up to 300 were dubious or fraudulent, so that a person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election ballot, in which the high-ranking members of the Muslim community were told that people had put pressure on them to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities with a background in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There was concern that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to this kind of activity" for the sake of the politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the handling of postage tickets by political activists, in order to prevent 'voting'.
The current report by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks in connection with registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to produce an identity card before voting.
Dipping your fingers in an indestructible ink after you vote so that no one can vote twice.
systematic checks to ensure the nationality and the right to vote of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail-order voting.
Prohibition on political activists of dealing with completed post-posted voices and postcode envelopes.
The police have the right to form security chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person at a time is allowed to enter the ballot box.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought following the Tower Hamlet case.
"The election court dismissed Mr Rahman and his representative because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient 'scaling checks' of the sections responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"Last year's court ruling on Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and disguised electoral fraud and its denial by some parties."
The resemblance of the Olympic cyclist to Duchess Catherine and the other doppelgangers at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went wild this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.

Many have also seen a resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the gymnast who won the gold, Gabby Douglas and Anna burn! for the sake of Gabrielle Union's wide smiles.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4 x 200-metre freedom message shocked the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disappeared" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
The photographer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to launch his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who was brought into the CBC reporting team to bring color, was told to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that. "
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam during the second part of the message 1: 57.79 and missed 1.61 seconds from the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers all over Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese seaman died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet. "
The Chinese, Ai Yanhan, who was sleeping in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle finale, was described by the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with raging criticism of Byron MacDonald, and many called for his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
The tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist bunch.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for what MacDonald said: "We apologize for the comment on the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened. "
In the end, the CBC had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
My commentator, Scott Russel, had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to more than 90 other tweakers who complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they have been broadcast.
On last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our followers of social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry about what he said. "
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his speech by saying that he didn't mean it as personal.
"I would like to apologise for the comment I made last night after the message of women," Mr MacDonald said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
It goes without saying that I did not mean anything degrading by what I said, and I am very sorry. "
In Primark, uninhibited lingerie in the middle of the store, a woman reconciled to shock customers
The clients didn't know where to look when she got undressed in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He made things worse by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off his leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four pairs of underpants at a shop in Folkestone, Bouverie Place.
The Primark chain store in Folkestone Bouverie Place, where she tried her underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the shop, says that after trying on her underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says, "People weren't going to believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own clothes and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but did it without any shame.
Everyone was staring at her when she took off the underpants she had tried, and apparently she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like it, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks, and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he'd been wearing. "
The 33-year-old Davidson, living in Kent Town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone takes home a pair of underwear that someone else has worn and has not washed."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the shop staff tried to remove those clothes from the sale after the woman had left - which is correct.
It would be terrible to take new panties home and find that someone else has tried them without having washed them, "adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesman commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market. '
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked for advice on how to survive a gun-wielding robber or assailant at close range.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or behind.
If the assailant approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the assailant and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and upper arms, and punch the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant in the groin on his knee, and when he goes out of pain twice, slap him in the face with a gun barrel and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed assailant approaches from the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and rotate it so that the assailant cannot fire.
At the same time place your weight on the gun and punch the assailant in the chest with your fist. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash unless you're the Krav Maga Grand Master.
The world traveler, Ian Wright, who makes a tour guide, licks the most filthy places in Europe.
The British traveller put his resentment and his cactus reflex to a hard test by licking the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of their resistance by licking the euro banknote, handrail at Piccadilly Circus, train toilet flushing button and Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on the luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the trail of internal power, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the train toilet flush button may be disgusting, but in fact there are more bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On its way to Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen the good bacteria in the gut and for their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program where he tested the endurance of his intestines by travelling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
The licking of railway station handrails and toilet flushing buttons undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid and I put a lot of stuff in my mouth, like dirt, worms and frost."
In the movie, he really showed that he was worthy of his reputation.
The border only met in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison purposes, it should be noted that in counter-washed hands the quantity is usually less than 60.
The border met in a Russian public toilet where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units - in counter-washed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright, together with Valio, is an adventure in a documentary film called Ian Wright - Internal Power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
Nothing is more dirty than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here. "
Wright produced a documentary on Ian Wright - Internal Power in cooperation with Valio.
Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus containing lactic bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the category leader of Valio's snacks, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to look at, and at the same time it's about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we ended up with the idea of asking Ian to come along. "
The health of the intestines has become a global trend.
"Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and to tell you about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, about the importance of intestinal health and about how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestines has become a global trend and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor! "
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds to this: "Let's just say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain of the items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some of the targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some dirty licks on tape. "
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% reported that at least occasionally they used products that had been added to them.
The nuisance family destroyed a rental house owned by the city in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted.
The nuisance family left behind the damages of £50,000 in a city-owned rental house after they had been evicted due to the terrorist activity in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found that the apartment was in renovated condition.
The walls were full of holes, the floorboards were torn off, the garbage was spread on the floors and the walls were paved with graffiti.
The couple have moved now, and they're believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be rescued.
He says, "This has been a complete nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh in this matter, as the property is likely to be known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name. "
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's terror involved street fights with baseball bats, intimidation, drug use and trafficking of the surrounding population, and loud shouting, fighting and cursing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
The house had previously been sold drugs, and the floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors say the family was fighting on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forced the couple out this week after giving them 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction. They said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredible number of times. "
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted. "
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called in.
Trash and old toys had been thrown off the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour and family, because eviction is always the last measure the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my group, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who took part in the work and offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and signal that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted. "
Fitzpatrick says that the three boys in the family had all lived in an apartment at different times, but they were already in their 20s.
The dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now need to clean up the waste heaps around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found over 70 grams of cannabis plus scales and other supplies, plus £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of class B drugs with the intention of selling them.
He claimed that the money was his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's tombstone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were cremated with graffiti.
The police say they're calling for eviction of tenants who break the lease rules.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think that they can behave without prosecution, as well as to those who suffer from such behaviour," Crow says.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low flying, shore grinding army jet scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force, P-3C Orion, crashed into a startling low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were terrified when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic pictures show how an army plane comes close to contact with tourists taking sun on the sandy beach in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose to their feet in concern, understandably, from the noise of the jet engines, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the participants in the dramatic flight and the videos of the social media were Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew alarmingly low.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because the smoke from the nearby forest fires affected visibility, but the Air Force said that it didn't threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that due to the severe fog and the lack of visibility caused by the smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Expecting the first half of the year better than expected
In January to June, the Social and Health District of South Karelia (Exoote) achieved a better result than planned of EUR 3.4 million.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
This was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The care guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the waiting lists.
The extract shall cover the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten the queues and to buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be €4.6 million better than planned.
The Government of Exoten will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special bailiffs took a military oath in Immola
Seventy conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military jury was held in Immola on Friday.
The grand jury of the 10th Special Border Jäger Course was held in the garrison sports field.
The military oath was made by 70 garrisons.
Special border fighters are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border iceberg.
They invited 250 of them for the selection tests.
Special border rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the border forces were involved in the veteran meeting at the whaling ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A drawing of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operated by the RTA unit, the Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
Chief of Staff works for Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian, married to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, considered by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is producing various reports to the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
The latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would less often leave the scene of the whistle only when they get the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target daily police activity where it is most needed.
In the context of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up, under three national units, and at each police station its own criminal intelligence unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police, is in charge of the activities at national level.
The PTR units have people working from the Police, Customs and Border Guard, as they call them.
The RTA units, for their part, work in regions divided according to the police services and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes through registers, alert mission databases and findings.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on what he did, there's a certain image of the unsub.
Sequences may be made either on the basis of the method of performance or by the person concerned, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk the city with their collar up, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals and themselves are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police attempts to fight crime.
The methods are publicly reported by the police if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, a form of marking of vacant dwellings, which was reported in early summer, used in housing breaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest order the district court protocol, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time we steal gloves.
An interview has been held with Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppänen from Häme Police Department, Lieutenant Tuomo from Lepola from Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police are gathering and analysing information to plan practical action.
In the background, the decline in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage Pora reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined the fathers was killed in Syria.
The news shows that one of the three British students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Counselor Tasnai Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in the Syrian Raqua a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike on Raqqa, which is Isis' base in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family, she was just planning to flee a war-ravaged country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will, so that people understand that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone - and who will make people give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other school girls from East London, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married a Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
The Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate's Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the post of Judge Anton Scalia of the Supreme Court of the late.
Reid said at the phone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with a lot of confidence."
Reid's spokesman later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether or not he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the District Court of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans blocking the appointment of Garland are the "commanding officers" and "facilitators" of the presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats, nude calendars belong to women as well as men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
Instead of public storage models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told me earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old school Playboys, because he says, "Playboy is for men.
I do this to women. "
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures of female body praise," says Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who wish to use the calendar can send their pictures online or participate in open selection sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comment section with the namenotall Solitary Middle-aged Men, this claim is based on real research data.
According to YouTube, there is not a millenium-generation boom behind the emergence of a much-spoken vinyl record when the millenium wants to feel a physical object in its hands, but instead there is a nostalgia of middle age.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, age groups 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just a question of enthusiasts wanting to grab records, but also of emotional significance: older buyers of vinyl discs are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% versus 66%).
But is YouTube's results correct?
If this blog were a televised news transmission, the camera would follow me as I walk along the busy Soho Street, wearing an unembroidered gray jacket. I'd be showing up very fast, bending my hands into a cup and saying something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and robustness when hotels, Eats, Prets and PaperChase have taken over before the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I come very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and character by observing.
In Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (currently two young women, three middle-aged men), Reckless Records (currently eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time looking at the supply of shops.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is in part in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again the things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of late '60s and early' 70s stuff that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get it," he says.
He agrees that people who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and he adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my vice. "
The Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients are suitable for the YouTube profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been affected by the media jump, and these people have heard of the vinyl records coming again and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back, "he says.
This could explain the boom of a certain age of vinyl arousal.
And what about the alleged emotional significance of the audio records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide comfort to the same-minded types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset by the non-contact payment system.
The digital world may startle some of the vinylfans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means endurance and reminds us of the days of youth's happiness.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or gets material property for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things. "
"We're like social workers!" Wez's co-worker from behind the record pile.
An ICM opinion study conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their records.
The opinion study also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the buyers of a vinyl disc have no record player at all.
At this point in the news, I'd probably show you a serious face while I was browsing through a stack of bossa nova collections.
The re-entry of vinyl discs is also accompanied by a "trophy phenomenon" identified by Jonny, 42, the seller of the Sound of the Universe (three middle-aged men at the time).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do exist.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenage, who are just starting a hobby. "
The clientele is much more varied in Fop, where I arrive next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
Customers include seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is pleasing, even though the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz swinging from the speakers, the newest synthesizer pop of Wild Beasts.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to detect a deafening psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and looking at various discount records.
He's more of a watcher than shopping.
He says his income is low, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or something, but the fineness of a winery is... "he lets a lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to inspire a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping jeans, but who, instead, gather around the Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter who are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key boards for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior element and part so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure art vinyl decor.
But given that all the means of getting attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers on a scavenging trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most people do, at the same time, have the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl discs.
Although my studies show that YouTube's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online platforms.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or in working life.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning chilling in Berwick Street record shops, browsing records and avoiding the 30-year-old who acts as a television host, who looks scary and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker, the ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the longest-living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to Sharkscientist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice sharks for life were studied for 272 to 512 years, a female of five metres in length.
The French court dismissed the application for the termination of the shops in the jungle camp
The French court has rejected the request made by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops set up in refugee camps, which sell different products from tobacco to energy drinks to residents of refugee camps, and offer haircuts.
According to the prefective authorities of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, because free meals offered by the state-sponsored organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those who need them.
The Court of Justice of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary agents, but considered that the concerns of the prefects of Calais were "fully understandable '.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp are far more important than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids Café, which is non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors who are most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address calling for a children's café to be maintained.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in the number of summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to record levels of over 9,000 people.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food is falling sharply in Finland for consumers' pleasure and for producers' trouble.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become more expensive than 1%.
Over the last three years, food prices in Finland have fallen second most in those EU countries with the same wage levels as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data derive from the written by Ilkka Lehtinen, Statistics Finland's Development Manager, published in Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is this year's June.
In the early 2010's, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then a turn followed, and after that, food has become cheaper year after year.
Now the price is heavy by the Russian ban on food imports, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agricultural products have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," says Lehtinen.
The tightening of price competition in manufacturing and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large chains of S-Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as an impressive advertising campaign.
However, Finland is still not the place for cheap food, although food prices have fallen heavily.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries at the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continue to compete for prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
The school isn't exactly the same anymore.
Anyone returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan describes the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fine writing will be abandoned, and instead, schools will start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education starts at the fourth.
The main change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
They used to think the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting on a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived backbone of the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks are swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold a second record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
As growth rate is slow, the observations indicate that only about one centimetre per year, adult individuals have still lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Mr Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen were consulted.
He determined the age of the adult ice sharks of 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio carbon timing of the spectacles.
The mean age of the examined sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent Amazonian cookies, were exposed to the age of approximately 335 and 392 years.
As it has been found in previous studies that ice sharks reach maturity only at 4 metres, researchers calculated that they are at that stage about 150 years old.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann is fired for almost 300 people - no one cuts off sales.
Almost 300 employees are being laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operating companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"The result of the negotiations is a reduction of around 300 jobs, most of which will take the form of redundancies," Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The negotiations at Stockmann concerned about 3 000 workers.
At the beginning, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The aim of this reduction is to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be realised in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulty in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade continues to make losses.
According to the CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," says Veijäinen in the press release.
The performance improvement for the second quarter was mainly due to the successful success of Lindex's clothing chain.
The chain reached its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
The operating profit of Lindex increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainfall in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist from the HS.
There are rainfall in the middle of the country as well, but there are pits on the south side.
The temperature is no longer very high in the summer, as mercury is below 20 ° C in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenyan sports team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt.
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was performing as a national athlete in a doping test.
News agency AP told us that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a surprise test sample as Rotichina.
Doping officials came to turn Anzrah over to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour, "said Mr Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, when he came to the news office, Reuters.
The Olympic sport begins on Friday, and Rotichi is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich scored last year at the World Cup on his way to fourth and is in advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was using the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and they took him to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he'd be exposed, "the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio sports stadium rubble its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, watching sports.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was started on the medals of universal sport, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show their skills to an unfathomable audience.
The Rio organizers told on Friday that only 58% of the first day's morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was one in London, where the stadium was cheering about a cheering crowd.
The finals' tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The distribution of the Olympic Games in Rio has attracted attention even before sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, paddling and riding.
When the Brazilian medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian twin, the Netherlands played against Russia and only about 30% of the 12 000 people were full.
At least the bad news is that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far away from European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilian people who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium full.
The organiser's spokesman, Mario Andrada, told us this weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million remaining to be sold," said Mr Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets to the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000.
More than half of the tickets are less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympic Games, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to the less well-known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
There were empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get a right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation was founded last year to acquire ecologically important natural areas.
Private, corporate and community entities can then redeem their rights as holders of land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire in exchange for the payment of the right of the holder.
The holder will have a veto right in a block of 187 square metres, which means in practice that not every holder needs to be approved if the land is to be changed for its purpose.
Holders' rights may also be acquired for more than one segment.
Acquisition of the right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You do not have to go anywhere to carry banderrolls or chain yourself up to protect nature, "Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired control of his company, explains.
For example, those who acquire the right to control receive accurate location information from their block, which allows for a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of those who acquired the ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the land section information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees as a risk to its acquisition of nature conservation only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public benefit foundation designed to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy Project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain intact and in peace.
The Foundation buys land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly for the sale of rightholders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected areas.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki shopping market on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torture Turku the biggest of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the number of inhabitants than in nine of the largest cities.
The Helsinki Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of the reported bike theft, how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August of this year, calculated per 1000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police records, there were four to five bike thieves per thousand inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, only about two wheel steals per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," Tommi Reen, the police officer of the government.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Mäikäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, considers it rather unexpected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of wheel steals is largely dependent on the number of learning and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight center, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are separated from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the January to August period, slightly fewer bike theft has been recorded by the police throughout Finland than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are reporting just over 20 000 bike steals a year.
It means 50-60 flillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They are large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be discovered.
A typical verified bike theft is one where the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught with blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations, for example in a drug case where there may be stolen bikes in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves get caught weekly in the act themselves or in police investigations, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are being stolen, for example, from shopping centres' wheelsets, courtyards, warehouses and cellars, virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopos are the most frequently stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bike, for example, for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some people might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant as he may be guilty of a crime of concealment or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a fit bike is sold at a clear price," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsi to the shelters of Kallio's library in Helsinki for every day of his work.
He's had five wheels, but not one of them has been stolen, the Moose says. "Never been taken, has been a good monk since."
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsingian Moose wonders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike waved against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, like a bike rack.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad wheels, that kind of boogeyman."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from the courtyard of the building company.
Although the bike was unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be stolen.
Under the age of 15 to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering the cycle of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator himself may join the Peer Jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Young officer Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
"All guide young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that, after their first crime, young people do not face the adult panel, but reflexes what has happened to people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Ilika Lovio, the service designer of Palmi, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault, which was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
"It has been a message that continue on the path you choose," Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Helsinki project of the Young Immigrants, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need them, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican players want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it in order to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be redirected to the Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring a landslide to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate targeting of all possible funds to the Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorative anchor around their neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is the prominent Republican against Trump, Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, who are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children.
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, gave details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I am trying to be president so that the American economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump wants to be president so the economy goes well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The centre of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for American workers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"[President] I object to all trade agreements that act against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the Republican economic programme announced by Donald Trump on Monday that it "favours only millionaires of this kind."
Trump's proposed downgrade to corporate taxes has previously been called "Trump's loophole."
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton peed.
These are Rio ratings: The races have not glued the Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
The sports competitions are usually shown in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have so far failed to reach the highest number of spectators.
At the same time, 12% of the population have been glued to the screens at best: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators from the Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Championships in general sport one month ago received almost 800 000 spectators at a time at TV2, and the European Football Championships received a fair amount of another million.
So far, the Olympic species have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Mr Pau Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that for the first time in the Rio Olympic Games, viewers are divided into several instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Areena.
We are pleased with the number of television viewers who choose the Olympic Games in general.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated to an entire channel.
When a broadcast comes in 24 hours a day, and there are viewers all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of rio's broadcasts come in overnight in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone thinks it is lame now - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the primaries, it would have boarded up with it.
In addition, sport is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the audience has been close to what was expected.
When sports begin, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the competitions, which rose in Apple App Store on the first days of the Games to be the most uploaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're about 200 grand.
"The ratings of the network will not be available until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems at an early stage.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games appear on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
On Yle Fem you can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Speech passes the races daily.
The Olympic Games are not only perhaps the most laborious to the General ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, the Olympic Games will be seen both in the General and in commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters in the Ristinää.
It could be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technician-diving instructor, found a pressure of about 20 square meters in Ristiselä, the depth of which was 104 meters in the depth of the dive computer.
In summer 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small recess of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 meters extend to Saimaa, Tosivesi and the main lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the Sun.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
This way, your Päijää will not be included in the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 14.29: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes of average depth were wrong.
Skin from the tax area: Tax on pensioners continues to tighten
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage and salary earners.
The Ihana says that the anomaly was brought up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be made equal to the wage and salary earners.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income from work, which reduced taxation.
The case was heated in Parliament by opposition representatives who grilled the then Minister for Finance Alexander Stubb (Co.) of the election promises.
Purchasing power will be secured. It won't grow.
In the line outlined by the Minister for Finance, Petteri Orpo (Co.), the main issue of tax cuts is, according to Ihala, to safeguard and not increase purchasing power, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's insecurity.
The Ihani is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and the Orpo for their willingness to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says it's important for credibility to stick to the treaty.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government period.
It has been done by the social partners, so it must not be destroyed by questioning.
This will be necessary because the economy is so heavily dependent on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Addressing prolonged unemployment in a quarrel
The deranged man appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget crisis, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were around 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of raising the employment rate to 72% will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed during the bombing of Finnish time.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand because of explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, "says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out specifically to Finns in Hua Hin to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalia, there's no record of the person responsible for the attacks yet.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict in relation to the Muslim population, says Westphalia.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalia.
He says the city is celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, these attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket and Hua Hin, popular by tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded in the newspaper.
According to local authorities, the popular tourist destination Hua Hin has launched a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
There was at least one death in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in southern Thailand, Surat Than village and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in both.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of a military junta ruling Thailand, the perpetrators of the attacks are not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic more, he said to journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators were intended to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who are going to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the advice of the High emissary on caution, "says Westphalia.
In wounded Europeans
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
There's been a little more information about the attack last night at Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutchmen and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near the clock tower known as the sightseeing.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
An employee of the county was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which blew up about half an hour ago.
Bangkok Post says the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won a women's quadruple match
The US Alexandra Raisman was second in 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina in third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still reaching for scaffolding in the Rio Games with perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics to a great extent over the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships from the last three years.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
The United States team in Biles has achieved two world championships.
The milder World Cup medals in Biles are from the jump and the boom.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huvila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think that there will be any more amazing results, the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates about twenty years working in the Huvila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If they haven't banished tourists before, I don't think this one has.
The company's office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The blanket heard about the attack from one of its own employees.
The employee called at about 9: 00 local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The villa says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set up for the Queen's birthday, "says Huvila and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong's atmosphere was peaceful and the main street shops were allowed to open at about 10: 00 local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past half of the day in Thailand, Patong's traffic was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, "says the Huvila who went to the scene.
Later, the car in question was seen on Jouxholmintee in its Kronupys.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was caught right away.
One of them ran away, but later they found him in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to motor vehicles.
The police thank you for the tip.
Research Director of the Russian Leaders' Changes: Clear Replacement
In Russia, on Friday, the highest level of leadership change was made in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old with Estonian background.
He's an ex-diplomat. He was second in command of Ivanov.
Kangasporo says that the reason why Ivanov was fired may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up an independent power for themselves.
According to the fabric stream, it is also possible that Ivanov has been compromised by other leaders or has screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, takes over special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked to be reassigned and proposed that Vaina replace him, "said Russia Today.
Kangasporo says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet period.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but he was elected president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangasporo points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Older researcher Katri Pynnuniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place that Putin changes his immediate surroundings younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they withdrew from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, "said Sherfan Darwish, representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90% of the city of Manbiji, which is important to Isis last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected to the previous news at 7: 30 p.m.: Previously, we misinformed you that the sirens were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document release is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutainen of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian says to the STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the State Council's Office and on the grounds that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry tells the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has been running against time under a race of values.
He insulted his back thigh in the early part of the year and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic qualifying.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key point, Mr Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included a bunch of low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, there is a sign that the star of Jamaica has risen in an age when sport has been struggling with doping scandals and a slipping interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was reduced to 200 metres in the early stages in the period 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by the injuries and your loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began on a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of the competitors, despite the final celebration, in the time of 9: 69.
This is harder.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached the legal point of his career, measuring the clock.
World records in Berlin at 9.58 metres and 19.19 in 2 hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
On 100, Bolt's greatest contender is the Olympic champion Justin Gatlin of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American with just one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the final of the lottery if he can get on the road.
In Daegu 2011, the 100-World Cup finals were left unrun by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as his last goal.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Exhibit from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, China's Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in a sample of doping from Chinese implants Chen Xinyi.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athlete was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of an epo-hormone.
He was fourth in Rio for a 100-metre-a-foot female butterfly swing.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese suimmer has taken his doping case to the International Civil Service Tribunal for Sport (ICC).
Xinhua tells us that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that the Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenia, for her part, has sent a sports coach home from Rio for doping.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, told us that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media records, this is Kenyan speed-running coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-meter runner, Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will not be stopped by anything - historical gold came on display style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympic Games, Michael Phelps of the United States swam 200 metres in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps won 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino ranked second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun. The BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at the evening paper in a quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening paper website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get too stressed if there's a little noise in the social media or in the British press about his revealing and extraordinary outfits.
I mean, television is visual media, he stresses.
Skelton is wearing high-interest shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough exposure - at least for many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small things are just a funny thing.
Well, I'm sure Skelton wants to freak out, and maybe he does, but he stresses that he doesn't want to play a leading role.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the noise has gone all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is fine with me, Skelton grinds.
You know what?
It's a fuss out of nowhere if it comes from dressing up (host).
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests for suspected terrorism.
The Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the races.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by the police in July.
They believe that the detainees are connected to the Isis extremism.
It was reported that the detainees had incited violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been disseminated in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
85 000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place off to the public.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time in the Rio Olympics when the police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package we found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the explosion.
The public didn't get to the stands by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package they found in the hangar.
The police blew up the package and let the public in the hall only after that.
The shot woke up the Spanish team that started the race with dreams.
With two losses, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria at points 96 to 87.
In the last two races Spain reached silver.
The police already performed a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time a police officer had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road cycling target last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian lady dressed Peteja-Siren - a Finnish citizen was thinking of a protest
The wind in the Cheater-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind on the Cheater-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady, on Thursday in Rio, put on the Wind Peterer Siren at the launch of the Day of Women's Surfing.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted to failure.
He got stuck in a car accident, and the others ran away, and the head coach of Finland, Joakim Wilenius, told us.
The athlete was considering a protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, then, because it would have been pointless under the rules of the Olympic Games.
I should have fallen into the water so I could be compensated, "said the Cheater-Siren.
The Finnish man hung on his board until the last because he didn't want to go into Rio's dirty water.
With the accident, the Finnish citizen remained in position at the time of his departure at 27.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Palestinian medalist is the eighth.
The accident with the tip didn't really affect much.
Friday is a big day when it's time to race for departure 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petey-Siren did not make a protest.
7 special issues which, according to science, prolong the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life extends.
Sometimes, things that can't be influenced by the person himself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to have a moderate or social presence.
Regular shopping can prolong age.
You don't have to go all the way out there to get a can of milk.
There's been a lot of research into the secret of a long age.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
Science says all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A study by Harvard University concluded that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to a "reduced risk of death ', particularly in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, there are studies in favour of alcohol that suggest that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can prolong a person's life by up to six years, a study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can, on the other hand, contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be more noisy people alive when the experiment was over.
Sex, where protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings extra years, and it is not a question of denying it.
However, achieving long-term age does not require absolute volatility.
A study by the University of Oxford found that the cholesterol levels of women with a large ass were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these issues with lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete who got into the Olympics or an actor who won the Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than a regular bumblebee.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long age is due to the social status of the person - who in turn makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of shopping behaviour among over 65 years of age found that the person shopping daily was likely to be less likely to be shopping older than the person shopping.
This is due to the fact that moving in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been shown to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring about death.
So you're gonna have to put the credit card down on your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver derailed into the truck.
On Friday night a serious truck and passenger car crash took place in Koski in Varsinais-Suomen.
The accident took place in Koskell, mid-way between Koskenti and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the passenger car that came across had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left standing in its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car went into a ditch and then, from there, across the ditch to the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972 who was driving a passenger car got squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in an aggravated DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket's bulk range was deficient because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to the Seinäjoki river.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday to buy candy from Salo's K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk sweets because the Post delivered our load to the Seinäjoki River!
We'll get more when Post gets the load!
So unless there was traffic in the lawn mowing, it was on the sign.
The sign that foxes its shop is linked to the fact that last spring Post expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The lawnmower is serving the Post until the end of August.
Fairy thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
The media have been calling all the time, and the attention that has been drawn to this is incredible, and Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia managed to grab her own favorites in a bag of candy, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who was responsible for the company's transport services business in Post, regretted the damage to evening-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to sub-delivery (Salo) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told the evening-saying.
This is the first story to be reported by the Evening News.
Teija Haltia was not indignant at the sign because she found all of her own candy cutters in the selection.

The wish of the wife's family murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hoped that the victim would be remembered for a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and addresses.
The Sipoo Veterinary Department has published a Facebook update to convey the victim's family's wishes for donations to police dogs.
In the publication it is reported that the victim had been employed as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinarian station and had also completed his carer training there.
The vet station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, funny and not afraid of work.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to the police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safe clothes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovian woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have told the evening paper that the victim was a very dear animal.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening state of arrest.
However, the stock market survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post to breach of the Equality Act
The postal service had no right to withhold the salary of a non-familiarisation worker, assessed by the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The district court obliged Post to pay the worker most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of his salary corresponding to his share of the day's work.
According to the District Court, in breach of the Equality Act, the worker was placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Association Decision of the Union for Posts and Logistics on the ban on education.
During last year's November postal bill, PAU made a decision that Post's employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
The news of the people first told me.
Returning Turkey to a path that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and respect for human rights, writing to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their response to the Journalist Alliance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipila and Soin to express their concern for Turkish freedom of expression and of the press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of freedom of expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration - in place of the Estonian-based Vaino
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says Kremlin.
This will be the grandson of Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old ex-diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, according to Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin Communication, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will take over special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked to be reassigned and proposed to replace Vaina, "says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
A lot of people thought Ivanov was a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition into a game ban - cannot be seen in the opening of the League of Valioliga
The world record man for football moves is not seen in the field when the British League of Whites is kicked in this weekend.
Paul Pogba's prohibition of gambling followed along to England.
Manchester United's gigantic acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the sidelines because of the ban when ManU opens its league against Bournemouth on Sunday, told BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba as an Italian society to Juventus.
However, the English football union FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was left with a ban on Juventus.
He got two warnings last season in the Italian cup, and it's gonna be a one-game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England. The FA told BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when the ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event, marked by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the artists on the main stage is the punk-legend Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is staged with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind this success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's kind of unusual to think like this when it comes to the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of 70,000 visitors in the last year by 5,000.
The festival will see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance the work.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered along huge paths.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinking bars in a partially artificial grass area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, 15 000 people's tent is the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a bit of a grandeur, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done to Kallio is that today, even the great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creamy things," like building that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a unique dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
Above all, we want to stand out on the substance.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit in with Flow's world of value: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan group in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at the festival that combines inindirock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we'll see this at a gig in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - the tourists fled in horror
The Hua Hin blew up local time on Thursday night with two bombs.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as the tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumuran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wild animal protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't get a good look at the tweet, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hint were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had gone off at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told the Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favoured by Finns.
No one was killed, apparently.
Meanwhile, there was another double bomb attack at Hua Hin.
At least one died and three wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police say they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombings, which are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken over the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KML: This part of the new stand-by forces will first go into battle in a war situation
In the event of an acute war, the armed forces will not be ordered to engage in battle until several months after the oath has been taken, "says the Central Finnish.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the military armed forces serving for 5.5 months, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve members of the stand-by forces are first appointed.
None of the garrisons or the reservists are ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became clear that the Defence Forces will start training the armed forces in the immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations even during training as a garrison.
Pamela Tola got a huge refund for the mold house.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, the house revealed a serious problem of moisture, which caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in financial losses for Tola and Warma amounting to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the district court and in the court of court.
The court of appeal gave judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse a couple's legal and settlement expenses for a total of EUR 47 344.
The right made the price reduction slightly reasonable, as some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known by the buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building faults that had occurred were substantially more serious than those which had been put forward.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report were not harmful.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rainfall and melting water running along rock courses.
However, the discussions did not reveal that there was any urgency at all.
Tola and Waroma were under the impression that rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which was reported by witnesses to be due both to the rainfall of the rock and to the capillary increase in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial polluted air was also allowed to enter the interior via the porch, according to the inspector's assessment.
A mould or yeast that would allow a healthy risk, above the limit values, was found in brush samples from the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window napper and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also argued whether the apartment had been extended in breach of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes had been made to the dwelling in breach of the permit prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Warma felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal finds in its judgment.
Creepy archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter on how documents on microfilms have been recorded in the US National Archives in Maryland concerning a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards originate from the National Racial Office in Nazi Germany.
The Breed Agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The National Board of Breed looked into women's background, including through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency the hand-written biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Breed Office wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who were very good at German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the records.
SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether in marriage or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; the site of the US Holocaust Museum is described.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting the acquisition of children.
The German mother's honour card was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.

In the overall situation, the Lindgreens are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded with a few hours of sleep: "I was so hung up"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was best sold by Finland as a solo artist and star of dance boards and festivals from the bartender of the cruise ship in 1995, is still able to boast and is currently in a fierce uplift.
A book by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and his career in good and evil.
Sillanpää's career rose to total praise when he won the crown of the Tango King in the Seinäjoki Tangomark market in 1995.
At the competition, Sillanpää sang thong songs, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kupapäki had written a tango song to Sillanka at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: the bridge head sang it on the tape with a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from the recording of a song that had become a giant hit, that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and to be top-notch.
The second incident related to the most popular songs of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from its then partner and the case ended up in the texts of You earned the gold song, which was published as a single in 2014.
It says in the book that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmäse were not the same as the Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true; it was written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the news of Jari and his ex-beloved divorce, Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption were the reasons for it, but Jari said it was total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it, and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polls of the voting week anticipated the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
None of the prestigious research institutes or universities were in favour of divorce, although a couple of individual scientists might disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign by the former US President, Bill Clinton, was "It's the economy, stupid" in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they couldn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics reports responses from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, the voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently reflected.
They were particularly struck by the fairness of the BBC, which gave just as much space to a few per cent of the economists in favour of the EU separation as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in explaining the views of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic power letters on the consequences of the distinction.
Those far-flung combinations of letters talked face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both heard and understood, then they were ignored because economists represent an elite with which voters themselves do not share any common interests.
Academics such as economists in large cities would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas was not working.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants rush your hospital, immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British man get to be a doctor if he didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children, too.
How much easier would the real British children get to have a school if they got rid of them?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund reserved for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was the Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were carried out by Pertti Vanhanen, Finland.
According to him, in Aberdeen, we were prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, we began to prepare for the victory of Plan B, the camp in favour of the EU's separation, in case the result was left.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds out of the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, "says Vanhanen about Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Old Man, the standard would be 15-20%.
At the time, the value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Thus, real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp for the EU broke up won, Europe became a mess.
However, the two weeks following the vote on the property market were quite calm, "says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he felt that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, these people robbed the situation and put it in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, "says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and the fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation because of the cash collected, but it had to freeze its trade for six days in the end.
According to the Elder, they did not actually close down the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be withdrawn in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you do not have to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most people canceled the ad.
Since then it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, "says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the European Union funds in Aberdeen.
But there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention for real estate funds
Mr Vanhanen felt that the closure of real estate funds' transactions received an excessive amount of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures dominate approximately four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen closed down for six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be "blatant" from the point of view of Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, Mr Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is at its weakest for 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought down the London real estate market.
At 2: 00 in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at 4: 00, when Pertti Vanhanen, the manager of the property investments of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word for it.
I realized that this is going to side with Plan B, "says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed straight for work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the night.
The TV screens that were normally set to be silent at the office gave the news a boost, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the display terminals were blinking red.
It was one of those mornings that you never thought you'd live, "says Vanhanen.
It is not that, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, "says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market started to anticipate severe bills on the British real estate market, especially in London.
As many as 20% of the office buildings in London were expected to be negative in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the storm has gone down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what is going on with Brexit.
So much remains to be said: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been first reported.
The CBRE Real Estate Service Company's data on price developments cover approximately one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the minus was collected, and Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't so bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have there been worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same drops hit crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, moreover, that Brexit was compared quite quickly with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began on the US property market.
Mr Vanhainen feels that the comparison is not entirely correct, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
It's a different atmosphere.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that in the past, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You can find your money, too.
The repair shop could have been in the way anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of buildings in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
For two years now, we have been saying that the city, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started at a very high altitude.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class that becomes globalised, says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, as a known city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less used than during the boom before the crisis in 2008.
Spread out, spread out
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, "says Vanhanen.
Aberde also began to lighten his holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's coming.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
A lot of things he's not afraid to judge, but he says there's hardly any spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or even going ahead.
The old man has seen several shops up and down, because he's been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can get away with it.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have distributed, the risks are also distributed, "says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register shopping information more closely
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group today announced that it will start collecting more detailed information on the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the information has been collected so far from the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to apply for the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group comes here after Kesko, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data will be collected with the agreement of the customer and will be used for marketing under authorisation.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, "says Riitala to the Financial Messages.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to the grocery shopping alone.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for marketing targeted at the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are only collected from K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not release their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer programme and such a programme is not planned for this period.
In Finland, the local store has its own customer loyalty program called "First Bonus," which can be associated with selected houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group level data, we stick to the balance of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on which day, as well as the customer's receipt, the final amount.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not permit the registration of product information.
Initially, the experiment
The customer owner and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
Basic data have included not only personal and address data but also professional, educational, housing and birth years and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase date and time, place, total purchase and method of payment have been saved from the S-Front Card purchase.
In addition, the data of the S-bonus partners are derived from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
By contrast, in S-markets, Prismos, Home Terror and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be targeted more closely, "says Marjaana Saarikoski, the customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they'll be reporting a change to their customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored at the cashier's offices in any case, whether they want to or not.
A willing person can check his or her stored information on the S-Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: The Heila puppy is Customs's newest dog confirmation - the puppy will be the first exploding dog
The black labrador's cub sniffs fiercely five similar boxes lined up at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle drawer.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing with that favorite toy.
The box that Heila was sitting next to revealed a jar of casings that were smelling gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online commerce
Heila is Customs's first specialist in the search for weapons and explosives and will be stationed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job as the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures in Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, "says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second main reason for training an arms and explosives dog for Customs's tasks is the postal services through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport every year, including weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 findings related to the purchase of weapons, arms parts, ammunition and explosives at Helsinki Airport, as well as their precursors, from online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports it will be a great advantage in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require further research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of arms and explosives dogs will be carried out in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in the church moor
The Heila puppy's education is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila with police and military experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells they teach Heila to identify.
Heila will always be further trained as necessary, "says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs's six drug dogs as well as the Money and Drug Dog Massi.
The Labrador Reaper, Heila, has been selected from the ten puppies' litter.
The criteria for selecting a dog to choose from at the airport include bellyaching and hunting, as well as tranquillity, as the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go home without Heila. Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the evening-message says that he loses to a fast dog the protection of the camera's mike, but Heila returns the protection that looks like a soft toy right away from the "get off" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen on the job site at Helsinki Airport in the next half of next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to ironing the work vest on top of the dog, remind Suntio.
One working dog costs around EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from 8 to 10 hours, but active work rates can last from only 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the work dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
The owner of the heila was applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The mini-state got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold Rugby of Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued that the government has set 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the Earth Broadcasting Corporation, the Fiji Government confirmed this once the championship was completed.
The day off is the day after the team returned home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian tells us that in the country the final was followed in the capital of Suva, where the stadium had a screen set up.
Normally only native Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times editor Majes Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish crane fainted after a fierce performance
The weight-lift Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt at 175 kilos after a tough battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for a lift.
During or immediately after the severe lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got 175 kilos of employment in Rio and 145 kilos for the stroke.
He had 200 pounds in common.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as did the other one.
With the third attempt, the weight rose with the fierce screaming.
The body was trembling under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The satisfaction of the Finnish lifeguard was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Leadership League - Evening-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the men's football league, has made a deal with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa for the rest of the season.
We are looking for a top player on our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than ten players from all over the world.
And gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, and RoPS coach Juha Malinen told us in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPssi, Florida, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki River, where the Rovaniemites will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threat Modern Family Star once again shakes: Teenage Star shorts reveal almost everything.
Ariel Winter, who is known as Alex Dunphy in the modern family comedy series, blinks again by presenting his daring body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only exposed the actor's legs, but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behaviour to a much more courageous one.
The star has posed in his social media photos in very few clothes and has taken many tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very few costumes.
Winter on the threshold of adulthood has recently published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his profile so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child's star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life and he's grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started out in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has displeased some of his long-standing fans with his image transformation.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman at Winter Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration to many women, glowing a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start northern lights from the beginning of the autumn, "Visit Finland explains in the newsletter.
The main destinations of the Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly linked to heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for northern lights in Lapland during winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and goes on to the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times as fairy, says Anne Lind, the marketing manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group for the Northern Lights campaign in Finland is rich Japanese women aged between 25 and 35 who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University and from Turku and Tokyo Universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lind, Northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased clearly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, "Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver at the rugby-7 when Fiji's champion team won gold.
The impressive success of the rugby race of seven players in Great Britain was shattered when Fiji won it on Thursday in the final of the Rio Deodoro Stadium in numbers 43-7.
Fidzi taught the champions a lesson in ball handling, transplants, sidelines, a game of support, running lines and brutal power and thus won gold - if it was the country's first Olympic medal in its entire history.
They can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tight victory of the South African Boxes in the 7-5 semifinals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been fully powered.
It may be comforting for Great Britain that at least one British man will get a gold medal tomorrow: Fidz head coach Ben Ryan, former coach of the English rugby-7 team from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Seven tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Losing is painful, but progress is startling.
Fidzi was excellent in starting and presenting his tackle skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team ran into a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinsau made a crash at the corner.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored a second goal on the right side of the target.
The 12-0 situation, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the staggering Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow Fiji down for long.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Blood Malua scored at the right angle, after which Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for a follow-up, when the first half-time playing time was still more than one minute.
After this, Vatemo Ravoisuuu crashed through the more powerless clams of the British team and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in 29-0.
It seemed that the Fiji people were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the sport as an apprentice.
Which is a lot of the truth.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in half-time and managed to hold off the Fiji for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team game of the Fiji.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down to 36-7 by scoring a goal for Britain at the left-hand corner, but the game was long ago lost to the South Sea archipelago, whose fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure joy.
Mata Viliame finished with the Fiji cake by scoring at the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fiji embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semifinals in numbers 20-5 and Britain had wandered past South Africa in a tight semifinals, where the balance was resolved by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown took over the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the paint poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, the 15-player rugby team player in England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold.
This is as emotional as gold could be in these games.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious bets into history and found additional meaning for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two in the oars, the third voice on the boat was the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to play their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duel. This makes them the first women in the history of British sport to reach a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two great athletes gliding on the water surface as swans of age, does not entirely correspond to the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each roar gold, each of which has taken the duel towards accomplishments. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who, 30 months ago, diagnosed cancer and who did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think. "
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can say so in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger. "
Immediately after the victory, the thoughts of the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who was behind the tour of Afghanistan, says: "I have been in ruins this week on an emotional level, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cashier have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so I'd say thank you so much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train with or a better coach. "
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very close in the moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to run off the route. "
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We did not seek the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race that we did. "
The twin will think about a year before deciding his future.
Glover will celebrate next month's wedding with Steve Backshall, a friend of the TV nature programs.
Now all he wants to do is enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure. "
"After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed out.
It took me about four minutes to figure it out this time.
This feels so much better, "he says.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
In October, Iceland will hold the premature parliamentary elections called for by protestors who have been ravaged by the Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's last spring's rage will affect the results of the autumn elections.
In June, there was a clear criticism of those in power in the presidential elections, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, a presidential candidate for the Republicans of the United States, withdrew his latest atrocities.
He said that he was being sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President, Barack Obama, was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and involved in the establishment of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was furious by what they said and demanded an apology from Trump.
The commander in chief of the army should never let anyone who could sink down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of the Muslim-favoured burkin bathing suit on the beaches, says among other things the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and swimming to anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which emphatically express religious links, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice, while a 31-year-old man drove to the celebration of French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - the blue-algae amplitude in Lake Pihkösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-leaved amplitude has been observed at the lake of Lüökösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took samples of water from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the beach of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters of all bathing areas were below the time limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal concentrations in the seawater of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
However, under favourable conditions, the situation may quickly turn into blue algae blossoms, resulting in the formation in ferries of blue green seaweed on the surface of the water.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
In the event of a blue seaweed opacity becoming blue seaweed blossoms, the bathing area shall also be notified separately on the bathing water declaration board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes proposed by the Ministry of Finance next year's budget proposal.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the change of the forest area.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational change of forest holdings is a good one, commented Juha Hakrainen, Director of Forestry at the Central Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the brittle finds criticism of the proposed tax change.
A reduction in the amount of the forest gift is proposed for the net capital income of the owner of the forest.
It is the capital income deducted from all other deductions.
According to MTK and Kakurainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of the wood.
The VM's proposal starts with a reduction in the net capital income of forestry that prevents it from resulting in a loss of capital income from forestry that would be deducted from other taxes.
A person like this would get a tax heist, even if they didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, "says Hakraainen.
In addition, he said that only a small proportion of forest owners were affected by the model.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in Kakurainen's mind.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of growing the size of the holding.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been reduced for decades according to Kakurainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail of fury caught the motorists at the Himanga, two cars derailed into a ditch and crashed into each other.
The Kalajoki Himanga had a special chase on Friday morning.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars driving in a row derailed into a ditch, and then the one in the back came running after the driver.
Harri Hähtiä, the day-old firefighter, said that the fall into the ditch was suspected to be due to a severe hail.
There were two people in the car behind the car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more details on their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the above was not injured.
The accident took place on Highway 8 from the Himanga a few miles to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers from the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings of the study group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of cancer increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatment may be improved by focusing on cancer cells in addition to interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications Journal in the field of cellular biology.
Muhos's family home death continues in court, the prosecution also demands a murder sentence against another perpetrator.
Muhos's family home death continues in court for both prisoners.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for the death of a family in Muhos.
The second received eight years of 4 months for, among other things, a murder as a young person and an aggravated robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The Taposta convict was also convicted of serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The district court judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, by the plaintiffs and by the man who was sentenced to a tougher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a lesser sentence for a man to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a director of a child protection unit at a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder assaulted a director sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had gotten out of his grip and led the young man to his room, when one of the young men hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a psych report, both convicted persons were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrate, growing only at 156.
The world's longest living backbone has been confirmed by an ice shark, a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, the holler, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The fact that it only grows one centimeter a year increases my life expectancy.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The scientists found out about the age by radio-carbon timing.
Because of the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest age was estimated at 392 years - although one way or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economist - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular through tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
It would leave a really huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Health reform in Barack Obama needs to be reconsidered.
The administration must be appointed "experts rather than bureaucrats."
According to Trump, "destructive" commercial policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be penalised by 45% and Mexico by 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
American, not global, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his own intentions, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organised protests.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see the Trump program leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early on Friday in Finnish time.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is a disaster, but the actual tsunami strikes in the middle of the streets of Madrid - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's story of novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work The Travelers (2013) was a small-time and grumpy satirical comedy, a pre-existing skin where I live (2011) Spanish career peaks.
On a level basis, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a chauvinese serenity drama of love, relationships and family, with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of it.
The story is simple, and we see much of it as a long flashback.
Life seems to be a model for middle-aged nominee (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will rise to the second leading woman, who is familiar with the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been dealt with in a way that can be regarded as a thorn, but I myself would say that it was quite a clever and literally a one-off sweep.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance from Juliet to such a characteristic flagrant.
It is a strongly played, restrained, place in places with good music and quite sad-minded film, where it contains ingredients in elegance.
Instead, the visual colours typical of the Spanish director are still present, and so that it slowly begins to put into the eye more as a pure formality than as a functioning dramatic power tool.
The people in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or, otherwise, only sudden losses, but the surface remains as rough.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a nominal person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise on these issues, but the main point, that is to say, the tone of the scene does not improve much.
In a mechanical repetition, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro awarded at Nobel in 2013.
The Novells have been published in the book The Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly even-thick literary film.
There would have been emotionally unparalleled elements in even more dramatic drama, that much of the big stuff - especially the deafening guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Direction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government is trying to make an election - People's News
There will be no further cuts, the saying ministers, so that the Finns of basic Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out by scavenging.
There will be no further surgery.
The 4 billion savings that have already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Minister for Finance Petteri Orpo (co-ed) are convinced of the budget crisis.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, because social security cuts were already decided in the spring's frame work.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment protection and almost all other benefits linked to national pensions will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training surgery continues.
The municipal elections haunt us.
Why do ministers stress so massively that there will be no further cuts on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the polls tell us that the government party's primary Finns are facing a slump loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, basic Finns received 752 new councillors, many of whom will be realised in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of approximately equal parties rests on the fact that the heel of the Finns is holding.
Now it has not lasted; more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the attendance of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and, second, they will try to soften the attack waiting for the Finns to come.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different... if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The government has set itself the objective of reversing debt in this parliamentary term, but the Petteri Orpo draft budget will take over EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not broken down or even slowed down.
The other is to hold on to the program.
This means new, even harder cuts on the former in 2017 budget strife.
The budget would at least push close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring elections will receive what comes.
These measures did not help to bridge the debt gap.
It is quite clear that the current measures did not break down debt, despite Juha Sipilä's attempts to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki's budget at the press conference prove this irrefutable:
The global economy's growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal to the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary recovery policy in the early 2010's.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Questionnaire: People want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of the KKS-Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also pass on responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, secondary school education and waste management to the individual municipality.
The responsibility of the region, for its part, is most clearly sought through the provision of regional education, specialist medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for the disabled.
None of the functions entrusted to the municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
The underage drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove a police patrol out on the Ilomantsin Road on Friday night at half past one.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man went to drive the police away from fair speeding.
The chase continued on the Sonkajanrannantee, from which the Sorronahontee and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, a young man ran running away, but a faster cop ran off to catch a fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Kavintie on Thursday night at 9: 15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue department pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above it, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
A crashed truck dripped into the road with hydraulics oil sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An old woman disappeared this afternoon in Ilmajoki.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoen Lahdenkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five feet tall, thin and good-strung with white hair under her chin.
Observations and clues about the lost movement are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre's hotline 0295440513.
Major accident material in the air - see photo gallery about the destruction of Paraphest
The crash current that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafestyistus, estimates that the festival will be able to get on its feet financially, and the event can also be arranged next year.
At the end of Friday night, Kalle Salonen, the last performer of Paraphest, performed on the market platform.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations at the city theatre premises starting at 1: 00.
The Art Center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition between 1: 00 and 15: 00.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The burst current is generated in a thunderstorm cloud when the rain water and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the status of thunderstorm water bind heat and therefore the falling air mass cools and its velocity towards the ground accelerates.
It is reported from the Finnish Meteorological Institute that several downflows occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash currents.
The crash stream hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Paraphest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5: 00.
Three tents fell over, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child, who was transported to follow-up treatment with a minor injury.
Air pollution ages London people.
According to a study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is about Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than, for example, an elderly fellow living in rural areas.
Small particles aging the skin are a very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of almost 9,500 London people every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for London residents who walk on their way to work in close proximity to congested streets.
The inhabitants of London may try to protect themselves against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The brakes on the tractor let down a man standing in front of him.
A man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes of the tractor failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor still pushed him enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injuries.
The tractor couldn't have gone any further because it ran into the rocks in front of it.
The rush to the season to come with new power
The League-Riento, a river-mouth player in the volleyball Championships, is going on a series that starts in October from a better starting point than that of a man's memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when Rienno's beginnings have been dark.
Jani Säisi, who continues to be Rienno's head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, the centralists Fred Musoni will start his second season in Rienna.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson on the Rwanda national team is a six-foot-tall hacker.
Garchet is a passport, and the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
Josba, Katja and the River Boys to the United States National Team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all the alibiandy World Cup since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada since being better at the North American Qualifications.
I used to work in Turku and play with women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was about to set up a country team for the Taliban.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppan, 48, says.
Jomppanen was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Jomppanen entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was not yet a sport played at SM level like alibandy.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey series, Juppänen remembers.
Jomppanen played the Salibandyn SM series with the University during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
When he was playing, he trained the "A" girls at the club for the championship.
Women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jomppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, with a balance of 169 matches 51 + 34 = 85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoisian-oriented Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play at the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old, has played this game before six men's ground matches, where he has accumulated a total of power points of 9 + 4 = 13.
The 32-year-old defenseman Tatu Väänänen of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen has recovered from the thigh and is part of the standard equipment of the national team with 117 ground matches.
Mika Koponen was also appointed to the national team, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salimbymaa team is Petri Kettunen, a contender.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize box
Essi Hasu is quitting as a Beach Volley player at least after the current season.
The Beach Volley Finnish Championship will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
Within three days, medals are played in both adult and adolescent series.
In cooperation with Kouvola volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of each series will be eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY, raised by Essi Hasu, who has been at the beach volley peaks in Finland for several years.
Today, Hasu, living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the pesistadium.
I haven't been in adult shows in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals around the house.
The region of Kouvola lit the spark of Hasu into sport and gave good lunches for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of childhood in mind.
When I was nine, I started volleyball at the E-girls at Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the head is too big a jersey, knee pads on the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreography after a point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team's spirit created an environment in which it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved, and our teammate's dad was coaching us, and our mom was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already in junior season a natural choice of species to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
A song has been played on the beach of the Kärämälammi since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior Ski Tour part-competitions, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen in the SM finals at the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-punished duo in the tournament has a clear goal.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still don't have the gold SM in the trophy cabinet, but Hasu throws in riddles.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, there are new challenges to civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toenails will be put on the nail at least temporarily, and Hasu is planning.
The crash stream knocked over tents at the event of disabled people in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The crash stream knocked down three tents at the Parafest Festival of People with Disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
According to the Karelian, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the larger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5: 00 p.m.
The fire master Markus Viitaniemi, who was interviewed by the Karelian, will tell the newspaper that there was a major accident in the situation.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.
The great architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library from the front row
Now you can learn more about the history of the Central Library of the Centre, when the local department of Southern California of the Society of Architecture historians is organising a presentation event, led by Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, who have published a new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture."
Gee and Schwartzman will discuss and show pictures of the drawings made by Bertram Goodhue in 1926 and the restoration and additions made by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates in 1993.
The event will take place on 21 August at 14-16 p.m. in the Salle Moderne Hall at the Art Deco Southwestern School of Law (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Blvd.
Participants can take a tour of the following places: Central Hall, Period Rooms, Cactus Lounge and Tea Room.
Pre-ticket: SAH / SCC membership price is $15, the price is $25 for others.
An open industrial loft in downtown Los Angeles is undergoing a cosy transformation
The 90th anniversary of the Central Library of Los Angeles is clearly celebrated by a new book.
Solomon Koli boldly went into agriculture
Agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Kol began their activities as a continuation of their home state.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking a debt and increasing the volume so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into play.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a yard water, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to go along with the project and I have been fully involved in it, Mr Koli says and adds that if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who is growing meat trucks, is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results because Solomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future magazine.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He'll be able to vote on the newspaper's website until 9 / 9 / 8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has exceeded zero since October last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016% compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and annual inflation was -0.2% in July 2016 compared to July 2015.
Compared with the previous month, an increase in the prices of the following consumer groups was observed in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by anime, but some observers find it racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that are closer to absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Licherini painting.
The lenses are non-embellishable, tamper-proof tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All delusion steps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism of the fact that it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached shades of skin as a gift for beauty.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into crooked teeth and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions refer to the greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written, among other things, by the online publications The Verge and the Motherboard the day after Snapchat told us that he had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime metaphor.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed from images, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the equalisation of a very tasteful Asian caricature to the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellow face," but is taken to a despicable extremes. "
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience consists of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts, which may mean that they are likely to expect more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, this type of thing will not be very easily overlooked, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, a product manager and designer working in the Medium publication platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his writing and telephone interview in Medium, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of respect for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company's majority white and male leadership and ended his writing with hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that their unilateral staff does not have colored people, so they can make decisions of this kind, or they also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily" says the Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to reply to the argument.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, relying on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its spokesman, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For their part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress expert group, military officials distorted intelligence on Isis.
On Thursday, the Congress Group of Experts published a report that officials under the command of the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground indicated.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee set up a working group in which an interim report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts was produced. According to the analysts, the senior military authorities embellished their assessments of American action against Isis.
Central Command, briefly Cencom, is the headquarters of the US Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Cencom generally gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism activities than the facts showed on the ground and were, without exception, more positive than the analysis carried out by other units of the intelligence community," explained in the press release on the report.
"The events of Cencom are unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"The mistakes of the management stage of Cencom extend to the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report sets out in detail the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 with regard to the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts of the Central Command to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives an impression of the analysts, which gives them the impression that the Cencom leaders have put pressure on them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were much more positive than what was actually happening," says the report.
"For example, an official from Cencom made a public statement that a major military attack on Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isis' control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the United States Armed Forces manipulate the intelligence results obtained in order to minimise Isis' threat in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force once they learned of the doubts expressed by analysts about the manipulation of intelligence about Isis.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Cencom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee responsible for inquiry in the Chamber of Deputies published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Cencom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on Isis and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's high-ranking democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results," violated the morale of analysts "and" takes insufficient account of divergent views. "
According to Mr Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to put pressure on the analysts at Cencom to adapt its conclusions to the 'predetermined or political official line'.
The Daily Coast News site informed us on Tuesday about the preliminary results of the Congress's investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, which was initiated following actions brought by Cencom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his briefing that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (argument put forward by an increasing number of defence authorities).
However, the arguments put forward last year put into question how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and give honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Isis intelligence is in line with the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago, when Cencom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which President George W. Bush's Government, despite objections from many analysts, only supported small troops in Iraq and spent little time discussing what would follow from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Working Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at the refineries controlled by Isis had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported by the Times in September.
The then commander of Cencom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimonies given to the Senate were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's field hockey and consolidate its position in the dispute with Britain
After scoring three goals in a victorious, scored 6-1 solved game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the US women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but a 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of what they're doing."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and are sharing the first place in their group with Britain, who continued his winning streak by winning on Thursday in Japanese figures 2-0.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which determines which of them will be the first of the six teams and which of them will be the second.
The first person to avoid a long-term encounter with a hard-core Dutch team that won the second block.
Despite what happens on Saturday's game, the Americans have already made a fuss about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and took a field hockey bat for the first time only at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the game in Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he couldn't make the final list of players.
After that, there were 2012 races in which he and his team did not see much success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and then things started to change.
"Change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London was not as it is now.
We have made a full translation. "
On Thursday night Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a knuckle.
India had come to the game without a single tournament victory, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left-hand side of the field, twisted to the midfield, hit the ball to the finish line and thus led the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament where US goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal had sunk into each one of the hits.
Briggs is now living in a period of success.
Like Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic crust, the trampoline brings in the Zen.
Regardless of location and time, the Olympic Games will inevitably be hit.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be following an intense message all the time and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton of communication, moving from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafeteria line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley will smile and may well have a name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be favoured by the sponsors and would appear on TV commercials of a good mind if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
Olympic Fire does not illuminate all competitions on an equal footing.
Further away from the centre, part of the shadow is less well-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breast, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the contained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has certainly participated in the Olympic Games, but the country has never reached the medals or the finals before 2012.
In men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on women's side the medals have been chained up by Canadians.
The Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will defend this year the gold medals they won in London.
However, the trampoline has the allure of an underdog, partly because in an uncivilized ear it sounds more appropriate to circus school than to the Olympic Games.
(I confess in this context that I am no expert, just a regular fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless pop-ups of characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, i.e. species that are essentially combined in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "pop board."
The ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that spins them up to almost 10 metres high. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as twists, bends and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty rate and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, of whom 16 are men and 16 are women.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Medals need to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field in pursuit of gold.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they aim to achieve in televised reports, namely the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is exquisite, admirable, even fanatical, and even enough to make a spectator cry.
But I also find this a little exhausting just for watching the races.
This is where the trampoline offers a breather.
Trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up like an astronaut, falls down and bumps right back up.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the finish line or a leap far, only a dreamlike and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men's respective races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon mission, which will start on both days at 2 p.m. local time.
In the midst of the Olympic mania brings a peaceful and wonderful moment that could be overlooked in the midst of a public howl.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes to watch and by objecting to them - as the American male gymnasts, according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested - then Logan Dooley will only be waiting for his respirating new fan group.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dismantled demonstrations that call for political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations, which are spreading to increasingly larger regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protestors.
The videos of the demonstrations, presumably at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces hit young people with sticks who have been forced to stand by their hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is all the more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Director of Research for the International Crisis Group on the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are very supportive of the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if anything, will receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at a fast pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically; the capital of Addis Ababa even has a new urban accommodation.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the model of democracy, and human rights organisations have consistently reported on the repressive policy of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been driven out of the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to show their minds, it will erupt out," says Seyum Teshome, lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All young people show their minds.
A whole generation protesting. "
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to government coalition strangulation over power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last post previously belonged to the opposition, and as a result they now dominate the whole of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the Eritrea border, where the aggravated situation required hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bittersweet mood that has been under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first one is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have the Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and access to the Internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people will still be able to access the Internet via proxy servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian young people told us that this is what they called people to protest.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a long time, Amharas, mainly from Christian highlands in Ethiopia, have dominated the country's politics and business and have taken up the Oramas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are about to fall under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have just been in the Oro and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population, and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unmentioned illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between counterparties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says the conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' boots with almost no idea.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no trust in the security forces under the control of the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, thousands of people were demonstrating against elections, which, according to the government analysts, were first screwed up and then stolen.
In post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment to the Ethiopian Government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amhara city of Gondari, demonstrators attacked tigres-owned companies, and anti-tigres hate speech is becoming more widespread in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring Somalia, but according to the US, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires a strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to withdraw his words in his latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious about repeatedly claiming that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founding fathers of the terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican half of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to its citizens.
His supporters are also in a difficult situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments which he might not have meant.
Trump made an argument at the election ceremony on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
However, early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump was completely tweeting his speech from the day before when he said in several interviews that he was very serious about his accusations.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back out of his claim.
The latest review storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the numbers fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their policy speeches on economic policy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received widespread criticism when he seemed to encourage the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump will stretch the limits of political speech and withdraw his words if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that raise an echo among his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to the messages, and" clarifies "in one way or another depending on the reactions," says Ruth Sherman, Communications Expert, who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the general public, Trump has changed his style even more in the last few days, as his support figures have continued to fall.
A new opinion study published on Friday by the NBC, the Wall Street Journal and the Marist revealed that Trump's support is considerably lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But, having been given more and more attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, the former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate vigorously during the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words justified, as a political speech," replied Giuliani when asked whether Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization which Obama completely misdescribed as a" lower series team "and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed Isis to continue to act when it did not deal with the situation decisively in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of the vexation of his speeches and of his discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "useless and pathetic" TV commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they cannot succeed.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
The café that has stopped due to the excessive rent increases opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly messy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was paid and there was no Wi-Fi, but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its street-side place on Bedford Avenue when the rent went out of proportion.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
The locals find this loss of a café that has been avoided under the middle class regrettable.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club no longer exists, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, they're also making new ones.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a few miles north of his original location.
The new Verb Café has Wi-Fi and can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even old Verb's lamps.
Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese-sandwich are available and capers and tan onion rings are available.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can't get beer from the café anymore, but you can get juice from fresh fruit instead.
After nine months of having a coffee shop, Rodriguez says that he has noticed that old standard customers have started to visit Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers also got priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to the café recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he took walks with him at the time at the Verb, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he'd stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he is drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also on the list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the café every time he worked, and he ordered the same without exception.
"I stepped into the café every day at quarter past seven, like a machine, and there they were already making my butter bagels with all the stuffing," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still orders its standard product, but occasionally he varies from bacon, eggs and cheese fillings from his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't resent the fact that the soap store took the old place.
The owners of Soap Chers even offered to make a special soap made using Verbi's own cold-stewed coffee.
"We may yet seize the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is seeking a suitable place for it so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-steamed coffee at the café.
The café may also extend to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough for them to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the café closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, I felt like I'd come home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The Great Depression's Deeply Food in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary artist, was fond of the luxurious cuisine of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose liver paste and Maryland tortoise soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the apartment building in Lower East Side by food.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in 1929 in the same year as the major stock market collapse.
Ziegelman, 54 years old, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple said it was suitable for the debate on eating a great period of depression.
"The troubles were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and rewarding.
Imagine eating so many peanuts, they'll be enough for the whole meal. "
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have weighed like lead in his stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, worked on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want."
Women made food for farmers, and fresh pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when the abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was the time when food became an American central and distressing topic" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
It was equally distressing to have a new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as forks and pot dishes became the main course of food, and they were said to be "a great way to use the leftovers', because chefs might have covered not such attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the central part of an American meal for years, became the most sparingly used luxury.
They tried strange mixtures, where the most important thing was the filling of calorie and nutritional values, not so much taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
When doing research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced a shortage of peanut butter-filled onions used as a food forage.
"He didn't get the popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where to
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes. "
Domestic experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Affairs from 1923 to 1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget holders and to respond to the challenge of making carrots like cream paget tasty dishes.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historic tastes.
The reports on the reaction of the state leadership to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's' let me eat the cake 'attitude, are particularly tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on a farm in Iowa, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-covered dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality. "
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the foods served in the White House were not only the boring ones in Washington, but also the least prepared. "
Many of the food in the depression was rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple say when they write the book that they have begun to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother, for example, why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of throwing food away," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once in the wind."
After the main food plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought up the plum dessert they made at home, the same one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving an impressive name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We were reluctant to sink our spoons into a thick brown goo.
Suddenly, it didn't taste so bad.
Coe did it the second time, and the third.
"Walnuts would make this better," Coe says to her wife, sounds like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation to Gilead for legal fees for patent litigation against the hepatitis C medicine with Merck
The judge at the United States Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for legal fees for a patent dispute with Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from the damages of $200 million imposed on it for the infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful medicines known as Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni. The US judge found that Merck committed crimes involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, the US Regional Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat more than 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and requested the private ownership of sofosbuvir in laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead medicines.
The United States-backed troops have taken Manbiji City from Isis.
The troops supported by the United States have been taken over in northern Syria by Manjib, near the Turkish border, when the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, says the spokesman for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now raiding the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that the 2 000 hostages captured by Isis' fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
On Friday, Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate for democracy, published her 2015 tax return, which shows that her and her husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid 34.2.
In 2015, the Clinton family donated a million dollars to charitable organisations, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, a former Foreign Minister, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster Publishers for his book on his term of office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice president candidate, Virginia senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton published 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a pattern of financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
It is customary that the US presidential candidates have always made public their tax information, although the law does not require them to do so.
The Newyork businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit and call it a reason why Trump has not disclosed his income data.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams referring to the tax records of the candidate for democracy.
On Thursday, special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including Mitt Romney and other Republican members of the Republicans of 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and published a video online on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to publish his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades and not his public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay any taxes or paid only a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times Business Coalition quoted on Friday several tax lawyers and auditors that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have risen to be a key issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named after a billionaire investor named Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election ceremony in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway is located in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he, too, has been subject to an audit by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns up to 2007.
The Clinton City of Chappaqua, New York State, today paid an average of 32% federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and their actual combined tax rate was around 40,5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income earned earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund and Clinton reported a total of USD 109 000 in dividend and interest income.

Fibre condoms filled with chili powder in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature guardians in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements - elephants are panicked by throwing chilli powder-filled condoms at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American Nature Conservation organisation, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without damaging elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"As we have developed the method, we have seen that attitudes have changed in these villages, because now the villagers can count on being able to keep the elephants out of their fields without damaging them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intruding elephant is startled by pointing at the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, let's throw the so-called chili cloud.
The soil-mixed chili powder is placed in the condom together with the firecracker and then the head of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left out.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads into the air a fine chili powder cloud.
Usually, one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last way to do this is to fire a projector that will blow up a fireworks fire known as a Roman candle and give birth to a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticises the Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli area code at the "call" of the Arabs - RT News
A French, Jewish filmmaker gave birth to a media brain after discovering that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention the Israeli area code in its list of land numbers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah documentary on Holocaust, took his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
With his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find a list of areas on the Israeli list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which direct calls can be made from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed - as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's answer upset him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the procedure was even more shocking to the film director.
According to Mr Lanzmann, the official said: 'Most of our guests are Arabs and they demand the removal of the Israeli code'.
Mr Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, Ambassador of Germany to Israel, interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the case was "a great shame."
"This case is shocking and upsetting to all of us.
It's a great shame.
And it is more shameful, given that we are in Germany and this is precisely the hotel chain.
That's all the explanations you need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction on the network, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski hotel simply of giving way to alleged claims made by Arab customers.
"Shame" was mentioned in a certain publication, which highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendam Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the list of areas was never given," writes the representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets for a Brazilian student demonstration.
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot started when law enforcement tried to break up the student population, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a austerity measure involving the closure of almost 100 public schools and the placement of 300 000 students in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffiti on the walls temporarily resisting Michel Temer, the president's office.
The students' demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of President Dima Rousseff when the Senate of the country voted on the charges against him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased 71% - RT Business
Since the abolition of sanctions, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in Iran's business has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries, "says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons was driven by trade, "says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects that the record number of Iranian tourists will travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian foreign delegation in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia.
It is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year, "he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner scored while the British beat cycling gold.
Callum Skinner in Scotland challenged the reputation of the men's team print at Rio Velodrom last night when the British Triangle defended the 2012 championship in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow played an anchor role that he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud when he climbed to the finish line and took the victory from the New Zealand team, which was regarded as a pre-favorite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they were only sixteen in March at the World Cup of Rail Ride Ride in London, despite Hoy having since left his competition career.
The problem between Beijing and London was to replace Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to close the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man the British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy's championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was barely behind after his tour, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner maintained.
Much of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down at a higher speed, which enabled Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny, and Hindex as they entered the trophy.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner says, "I am flattered by the parallelism.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it. "
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to fall on the track deliberately because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and British competitors had no means of appeal.
This time there was no such problem with sovereign victory.
Hides says, "The atmosphere was like London, all British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory at the Olympics feels great. "
In other words, one contest, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships both in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, five days of velodrom will be successful.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he would repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold in one Olympic Games.
This would mean an account accumulation of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
In that case, they would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is in a sprint that starts today and will be solved in three days.
Kenny, 28 years old in Bolton, says, "At the moment, all I can do is be happy about this.
The team competition is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy winning with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely. "
Hides says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have a knight's worth."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Dull were the fastest on a four-man team chase.
Their time was 3: 51.943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will be competing today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be on Wiggins.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition officers before the time-out when they invited him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's contest, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Sand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached world record 4: 13.260.
The British team can now count on its great track-cycle team to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional displays of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations prior to Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramatic developments, the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of allegations of sexuality and bullying, and the end of the competitions of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on velodrom on the first night show that the already legendary reputation of Great Britain is once again being realised at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminium smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and therefore thousands of workers' jobs are at stake when a power company that operates electricity to the smelter told us that one of the owners of the plant is in the process of dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria Government not to continue the aid to keep the plant in operation.
The fixed aid granted for 20 years will expire in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of the dismantling, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland melting plant is losing money and is in danger of being forced to close its doors.
These measures reflect the speculation that has been going on over the years about the future of the factory, which was initially caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of production of the factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects the other three owners of the smelter plant to terminate their contracts.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Alumina joint venture. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares.
AGL says it is waiting for the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the contracts are so-called hedging contracts, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period is 12 months and will end in 2017.
"Thus AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of the contracts by EUR 187 million in its accounts "as a prediction of the termination of the contracts."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's... ability to keep the melting plant in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant."
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still needs to clarify why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious both about their estimates of the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and about the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
The operational director of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, announced earlier in his speech to the analysts that at annual level Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these plants leave the market, this will mean a significant drop in demand (electricity) in the market.
As a producer to us, that would not be good news, "says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality TV star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and her manager, Krisi, Kendall Jenner, 20 posing in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performed in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Watching the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashians style?), a handwritten video showing all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar alarms Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite sister, the Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest), showing that they forgot their sister's cover picture. The video ends in a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost every part of the school's birthday period (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as a children's morning TV cartoon character), but Krisin had to get her other daughters into this publicity in some way.
For the appearance of Vogue in the September issue will undoubtedly mean a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beat Vogue's cover before (he appeared on the cover of Vogue together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its very own class.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold release a year.
A number that resembles a fashion magazine is more large in thickness than attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site in Fashion decreased that there were 615 pages of ads in the 832-page pouch last year).
The publication of the cover star of the September issue is so fervently awaited that in the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked out even before the official announcement.
Previously September's cover models include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models that are celebrities.
The Oscar winner and Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga received the honors.
The newspaper describes Jenner as a model of success for his generation, and even if he was more likely to be among the famous people who work in the model, he is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not related to known people, true TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about them).
They are rightly called talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year, Beyonce, who appeared in the cover photo, has behind him one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of its reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be difficult.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches."
These emotions have reappeared on the surface as news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, it seems to be irrelevant to the continuing agglomeration of discontent.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking on Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the ad face of Estee Lauder make-up creams.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures of themselves through pay-per-view apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he shot for the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he plays on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
The legal aid centres are turning away 160 000 people a year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be turned away from the legal aid centres and the sector will prepare for the impact that further budget cuts will have on centres already operating at the periphery.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people are already being turned away from seeking free legal aid and legal services - the majority of whom are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices, without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that thousands of people are being turned away from the centres every year, according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Legal Aid Centre.
If the federal government doesn't roll over, Farrell says it's only gonna get worse.
"The public legal aid centres in Queensland are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"People who leave violent relationships, people who are under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, workers who are unjustifiably dismissed - all have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to obtain the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and to the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to get rid of these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of public legal aid centres and their customers, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work. "
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: An action was brought against Donald Trump's campaign, when no action was supposed to have been taken after it had been told that the campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign at the state court in Charlotte.
Mr Bordini says that he has waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before, according to his own words, he realised that this would not happen.
My bordini says in his cover that campaign manager Earl Phillip "pulled out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, having lodged a complaint with the local and regional management, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini on his cover.
The action will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of the second additional section - who are considered to be weapons owners and arsonists - can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media took his word out of context, and Trump did not use his words to encourage violence.
In his application, Mr Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifference and from Phillip for assault, assault and mental suffering.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the message asking him to comment.
They couldn't reach Phillip despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call for information submitted to the Phillip Consulting Service.
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has been conducting a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity - not just in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the point that was most interested in Heathrow. As in the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to make our whole nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympic Games brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who believe that the expansion of Heathrow is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
Suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and boost the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force on Heathrow, which has implemented and maintained a budget of GBP 11 billion in infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5 terminal - which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years - and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
They are now ready to produce a third runway supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Board of Directors and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat-mouse games
The attempts by companies that earn their money from online advertising to distract anti-advertising software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one company that produces anti-advertising software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its website that it was blocking advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog entry where it told that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the labelling codes for advertising on its desktop site so that it would be more difficult to identify which parts of the website are advertising.
But now Adblock is telling us he's figured out the new codes.
Adblock's spokesman, Ben Williams, wrote in his blog, that "this kind of ballistics between the open source advertising community and the delusion has been going on since the anti-advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair shop again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertising inhibitors have become in the sector.
Worldwide, approximately 200 million people are using anti-advertising programmes, according to a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
The daily use of Facebook by mobile devices is 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in distracting advertising prevention programmes in its desktop application, as according to the spokesman, mobile advertising prevention programmes do not work in Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenues from Desktop ads are still sufficiently high, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it would update the advertising tool for user settings so that users can control more how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters as they also prevent the appearance of some ordinary Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook's spokesman in his email.
"Advertising prevention programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving her cars under a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway in the first hours of Thursday of an accident in which a woman deliberately left several cars behind.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud Canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate work by lying on the dark road, and she was hit by more than one car, "says Vaud Police in her press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her aim was clearly to commit suicide, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some of them are still unidentified.
The lawyer, Gilles Hofstetter, explains in Le Tribune de Geneva that criminal investigations have been launched, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the car drivers involved in the accident are being prosecuted.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It will remain for the prosecution, "says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have taken place over the last five years, on the basis of which motorists are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases the person walked on the dark highway and the court decided that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges of manslaughter against him after he ran into a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the method of driving a police officer - who was responding to an emergency call - was justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Any person who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus's past with the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and water-free and has a gas ring that consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to the scientists' previous performances, Venus's slow rate of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and has still been slow.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and has a day per sun for almost two months at a time," explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface for a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
With hydrogen running into space, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide-containing atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect - i.e. Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his position as coach of the Avalanche.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the club's hockey activities, claiming a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President / Director General of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey activities with vigour, passion and determination," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the deputy director of the club's hockey activities must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled. '
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the top coach of the year of the league for his first season as head coach in Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made it to overtime in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power stations in the period 2015-2016 and was five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing the second Wild Card spot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two in the Montreal Canadiens' ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
The North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say that the wage strike of the North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all the parties to the dispute take part in the new round of negotiations.
There have been strikes against the Wood Group providing oil field services on drilling platforms located in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to settle the dispute."
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks to deal with the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which, according to them, was the first one in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group will cut around 9% of its North Sea contractors' tariffs this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with the 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working on land in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts give it the room for manoeuvre needed to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, in order to make its operations more efficient after its megaphone merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK decision to leave the European Union in June will put pressure on energy companies.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with the Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just a few," says Anderson.
The new North Sea projects are expected to use less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, compared to around USD 7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejad constellation.
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speed of the stars in the Plejad constellation so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same constellation are spinning at different speeds and how the cycles are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with the other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of the solar system," says Luisa Reboll, researcher at Caltech University, Pasadena, in a press release.
The Plejad Starbase is located 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars of the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just about to reach their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever.
With the speed of rotation at the top of the growing stars, large amounts of star wind erupts.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rate of rotation is slowing.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of recognisable spots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest listed speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
Rebel compares the stars to the dancers, the larger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from Plejad's" dance "that slow-spinning are typically bigger, while the fastest-spinning are typically very light stars," says Rebel.
Since the Plejad constellation is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars in relation to the speed of rotation.
"The Plejad constellation offers a pillar for theoretical models of rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebel.
We want much more information about how, when and why the stars slow down to the speed of rotation and stop their "dance."
Reboll and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Plejad's speed of rotation in three new articles which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
