Juankoski City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next take place in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio's population is approximately 111 000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political talks with the Eastern Ukrainian separatists.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, according to Mr Putin, the news agency, Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said by Kiev and the West to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions where Putin said that the Ukrainian army were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Rhymmi repair house.
It was a surprise that people came out of the beginning of the night.
There were visitors in two days as expected, "says promotor Tom Kangas.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be a hip-hop festival, which means there's no pop coming, Kangas says.
On Tuesday, Finland will have a law restricting the procurement of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the police government for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
These include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the concentration values prescribed are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not usually exceed limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the law may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rape between Nairn and Pitlochry.
There's a trial waiting for the accused of rape in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the trial at Glasgow High Court.
He was accused of rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "while she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision herself."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands of Nairn on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the judgment of the Judge, Lady Rae, the trial will take place in Edinburgh on 17 November at the Supreme Court.
Valioliga: Super Raheem shine - Mario remained in shadow - Valioliga - Evening-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he was seen as a hope for the future of English football.
The White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, which was strengthened in Mario Balotelli, arrived at Tottenham.
The first performance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from those of Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality targets and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his team.
The Pool supporters who have already taken the player as their favorite will expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona as the second attacker of Luis Suarez.
As the star of the team, instead of Balotelli, the middle field diamond tip Raheem Sterling pushed past Hugo Lloris's important opening goal of the 3-0 victory.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with its power.
The Englishman, 20 centimeters shorter than Balotelli, is between the opponent's lines than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who runs on grass at best at about 34 km / h.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Ireland told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a player more integrated than the westwestern lonthoist who grew up at Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the upper conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Government of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin Helsinki City Orchestra as the next upper conductor since autumn 2016.
The papers up to the Los Angeles Times have been asking what orchestra he's taking next.
Susanna Mälkki tells us that she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of our country for over 100 years, including by presenting a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been run by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation, "he says.
Administrations of employees' organisations in the event of a retirement agreement - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus is being sought today for the pension negotiations for the social partners' own gatherings.
The administrations of the employees' organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The social partners have, among other things, been affected by the dispute over linking the retirement age to life expectancy.
Organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would be born this week.
Scrambled.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped over the league player Vampula Athletes will be thrown into the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula turned into a three-to-two victory in a one-year-old match.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of us the whole time.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and the pass game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikporö.
WoVo's spruce was rugged to the point that a six-foot American center, Jennifer Keddy, had her back stuck on the side.
As a Senter, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and formed the most firepower combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jana Jaudzema, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampula was a skilful Russian passport and a libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at 6: 00 a.m. in an official practice game.
On Sunday, we'll meet at the sports club again.

Ovarian cancer is more often fatal in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released this video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia in rural areas are at a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers went through the patient data of over 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
The lead investigator Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL INVESTIGATION: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses and socio-economic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and with wider cancer, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the investigation than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that there are possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment.
"Specialists in gynaecological oncology are the best at treating this disease, and their receptions are mostly in large cities," Jordan says.
Although telemedicine treatments are becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients away from home.
According to a study by Dr Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family girl in Gold Coast, Elisha Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the parking structure of the sleigh parking in the Friendship Park next to the Hotel Ostrobothov.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Friendship Park and its immediate surroundings would be made available to the public at a service point in Osvik.
Opinions are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Life Centre.
With the change in station layout, the city wants to enable the tourism-related snowmobile activity to continue in the region.
It is intended to create a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles shall be permanently available during the period from 15 November to 30 April.
It is also permitted to place refuelling points on a specified part of the area.
The new park area will also be allowed to be served.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during winter.
The lease contract was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The sleigh parking and the change of design have raised a lot of resistance.
The residents of the neighboring blocks have been nervous about both the sound and the concerns about emissions.
However, emissions from the region have been investigated and no observations beyond the guidance values have been found in the studies.
Even the reformed fleet is less emission than it used to be.
The parking area of the friendship park is also supported by the fact that, if the departure point were to be moved further away, the hotel's safari customers should be transported to safari destinations by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding area of the Friendship Park are also sufficiently large, better than the places proposed as replacement destinations such as the east side of the boat platform of the bridges of the river Ounasjoki.
The Friendship Park is a good place for its location, because in the future activities can be extended to, for example, the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which, among other things, the city aims to create a good framework for business by reserving sufficient quality areas for logistical and functional advantages.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling on the central part of the general formula, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is seen in garden shops
The reduction in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of gardening shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of gardening sales for their age. The Financial Times reported on the study of the Horticultural Trade Association (HTA) in Great Britain.
According to the report by the Financial Times, apartment rentals spend only 55% of the money spent by apartment owners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the gardening sector, whose estimated value is approximately GBP 5 billion a year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are the least spent per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Association of Gardens (RHS), the increase in the rental of dwellings or the reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The RHS's leading gardeners Guy Barter says that "for example, plants grown in portable nurseries are particularly popular among tenants, as such nurseries can be included in the transformation if necessary."
According to the HTA report, 1997-2005 were the flowering period for the secondary sale of the horticultural sector, as ownership and wealth of dwellings increased from the late 80's to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will increase this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year's March and April weather.
Turkey is interrogating an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy Commissioner and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by a former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main target of intelligence intelligence services in the United States and Great Britain.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyep Erdogan understated the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the espionage of Ankara by the German main intelligence service led to a more angry reaction by the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze will perform in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several success stories, has been attached to the female lead in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film for 2 nights until the morning, whose shoot starts this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the best female lead in Cannes Film Festival for his role in the Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film in the butterfly glass dome.
The main part of the 2 nights to the morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be Finnish premiere in September 2015.
Chief of Police at Mallorcan Magaluf on charges of corruption
The perpetrators of this case presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià's municipal government officials in the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on Mallorca holiday island has been arrested for moist celebrations as a result of corruption charges brought by the Magaluf region's known owners of the Magaluf region and bar.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several of the owners of Punta Ballena Street made corruption charges against him. Most of the bars and nightclubs in Punta Ballena Street are located in Magaluf.
According to Mallorca Diario, a daily newspaper published online, evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges and they are being interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The daily newspaper ABC, published throughout the country, wrote about the anger of the owners of nightclubs about the bias of the authorities, which made their business considerably more difficult.
"It is no longer a matter of money, but of survival," said a business owner to the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in newspaper headlines this summer when a YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British holiday boy had oral sex with 24 men during the "pub crawl."
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to control the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of the Magaluf holiday workers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the pub crawl operator Carnage were fined jointly EUR 55 000.
Above all, the popular Magaluf tourist destination among young British tourists has also become popular with the so-called Balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after having spent the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from the battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the footprints of the fighting are still visible.
At the Pashosh day care centre in the south of Ashodi, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We are a little scared, but we are also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in Kibbutts, an Israeli commune named Saad, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children living in this area urgently need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that going back to school in a long time is a little weird.
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutts near the Gaza Strip to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's cease-fire, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes to safer areas away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza front are sceptical about the return after the Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a good ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza Strip, which was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety would be provided."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues such as Hamas's call for the removal of the blockade of Israel and Egypt and for the re-opening of the air and sea routes in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the deaths were soldiers, although it has not had sufficient proof of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5 000 air strikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to a school maintained by more than 100 United Nations, which had been transformed into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still covered and fighting continued, the school authorities moved the start of school in the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old, protected school in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, prices of dwellings have increased most for seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments, measured by the prices of housing in the capital of Australia, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, as shown in the RP data on Monday.
As a result of the rise, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, which was more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to the research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
The results of RP Data show that prices of dwellings rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next highest, with an average price increase of between five and six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, spring in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of houses to be auctioned, the generally high pace of sales and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in house prices will continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record pieces to Mänttä
The new museum and film art have drawn record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been classical works of pop art from Andy Warholi and Roy Lichtain.
On Monday, Mänttä's photo art weeks told us that they had made a visitor record, when 14 500 interested people had visited the event of the Ankara this summer.
These figures are not used to.
The people have been shoveled by doors and windows, "says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sikonen estimates that the number of visitors for the whole year will come to the Serlachius museums this year to bring hundreds of thousands closer.
In previous years, there have been around 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has some 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen recalls that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä it is hoped that the art season will continue far over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
The police are investigating four recent robberies in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, a business property in the Nordic Street was broken into by breaking the window.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a truck tank on Deep River.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, a boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the port of Perennik.
The rowing boat was a Kalapalta-branded white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the word "OIVA" was written on the beak side.
A couple of suspects have already had a hard time with the police.
On Sunday night, a burglary broke into a business property on the Tikkapirontee.
A police dog got a hit and a 20-year-old paltamatan man was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police caught another man in Paltamo who is also suspected of having committed the same break-in.
The missing amphetamine brought the murder charge to Kajaani.
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamine charged a man born in 1977 with murder.
According to the prosecutor, a man had entered an apartment with his partner and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment he suspected was a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man who was with him was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when the police patrol stopped the passenger car, where the party was burning down the clothes used in the blood work.
In addition to the burnt closets, we found a broken shotgun in the car.
Kainuu District Court will give judgment on this matter later.
August was very warm in many places.
According to the Meteorological Institute, the average time of August is once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most countries, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter was 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a seven-child family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in the Midlands of Britain in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap at the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy many times since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face never showed up, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with Dad and discussed, for example, the shape of beer stuffing or the beauty of cricket pitch.
I never talked to him about that kind of thing.
For most of my life, he was to me the smiles man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better than they were at that time.
The melting plants are a little brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot come out and remind me of hell.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself while washing the filth of the melting plant away from himself.
When I walked around the melting plant, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food at the table, and I started to appreciate him more.
Despite that, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity of his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother started to get sick a little before she died that we started seeing each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a Billie daughter with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to say "I love you" all the time?
Will you stop hugging me?
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's still a good friend with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mom's death.
When I started to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full turn.
After that, I started working out a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change in career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making the theatre.
Next up was the Comedy of Errors and the Fences of August Wilson.
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comets Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only a 16-year-old factory employee.
A dishwasher driver spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's TV career started in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time, I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes on the slide between 1975 and 1985, while I was living stardom and on television, and that was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been a part of it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and repulsive, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people."
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the '80s, where both a joke was made and a black British culture admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known for his character Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with ads, documentaries, TV shows and movie parts, but after his show on LennyHenry.tv in the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just going to be on your feet or walking on the sidelines."
Next up was Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About..."?
The first part concerned Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was actually not properly taught at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why I was so scared about Shakespeare.
All the people we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said to me, "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You see the words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spoke 20 verses of Othello's last speech for a documentary, and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me was missing before, and now they put it in place.
"This is what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background check.
So the internship process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't quite happen.
Shortly after that, Henry played the lead in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was playing in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Wow, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me," You must survive 10 minutes alone until the computer works again. "
Instead, the pilot's assistant announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out on the stage, and part of me was sighing relief.
It's not my responsibility.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in character."
Henry "Fences" play at the Duchess Theater
Learning the lines for the Fences play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was well received, so it was a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
Of course, this is what Henry is saying with a fine voice.
I mean, I decided to stick to this.
I truly love this job.
I love internships.
But Henry is still basically a comedian: the little boys of humor are constantly interrupting our conversation as he changes from one image to another.
Abstentions from stand-up are a matter of will, because it seems dangerous to get immediate thanks from an unknown audience.
If you're thirsty for it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it doesn't inspire me the same way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit together with a director who will help to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I do not think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really fun.
When you play, you keep telling a story, and that's what I like to do.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payroll.
Workers who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the Government Bulletin announced.
The government has doubts that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars were spent on the salaries and other financial irregularities of "ghost workers."
The government suspects that the salaries will be paid into the account even after the person has died or left office, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri report on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must register in the identification centres in the next few weeks to ensure that their data are stored in biometric form, as stated in the government's newsletter.
According to the notice, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector, as it defines how many people actually work in their duties. It also cleans the payroll at both levels of the government. It solves the problem of" ghost workers, "says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Office of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Seinäjoki may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adapts its activities and expenditure developments to a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of improving the efficiency of services were to compromise the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, as well as the increase in tax and tax revenues.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is set at 8.5 million.
There's no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% reduction in state contributions further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategy objective, "says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Government has returned the proposals made to the Executive Board for further preparation.
The proposals of the City Government will form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Board's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the panel to the City Council and to the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "plotting" against the government.
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "anti-government schemes," according to local media sources.
The police didn't comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers in custody.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations in December last year, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large crime scene and tracing phones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyep Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at that time) said that police action was part of the planned action against him and others in power by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children go back to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told pregnant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremony of the first day of September was not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day include traditionally children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry in Texas, the blasphemous tweet was unauthorized.
The confirmed Twitter account of the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, sent a blasphemous picture of a Democratic District Attorney on Sunday night in the middle of hearing allegations of abuse of power.
Tweety was later removed, followed by a new tweety where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of a tweet and I've removed it," the later release said.
Perry's backup didn't respond immediately to the requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet contained a blasphemy image of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry prevented the funding of Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of Tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as I'm allowed... but when that happens, I charge Governor Perry with pointing his finger."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Anti, who was assigned to this task by a Republican magistrate.
Perry has said he's innocent and called them a political ploy.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge responsible to dismiss the charges and has said that the law on the basis of which the governor of Texas, who was the longest-serving governor, is unclear in view of the Constitution.
Perry cut government subsidies of $7.5 million to the State Department for Public Injury, which operates in Travis County and deals with public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision resulted in a formal complaint from a left-wing observatory.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated, and sometimes notorious.
After entering the fifth place at the election meeting in Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to close the tie by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself on a jogging lake with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital of London's housing has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases while fear of widespread credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley, a high-level developer, said that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the peak of 2013 'and added that this has allowed for a" stable environment'.
The London housing market went well during the recession, while foreign investors ran for capital.
According to the land register, prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by around one fifth last year, reaching a price increase of £423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's properties less attractive in recent months - some have also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric on the potential "manor tax" before the May general elections.
Last week, the London real estate agent, Foxtons, warned that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending rules, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans decreased in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices, according to which prices will fall by three per cent, as the index of prices for housing owners has already started to weaken.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter to one year ago, says the real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased the income from sold properties to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, correct product at the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained strong '.
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost one third more than at the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profit before taxes rose by 40 per cent from one year ago, resulting in GBP 380 million and the turnover increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, prior to the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley told us that Berkeley's annual earnings were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
The Berkeley stock sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at GBP 23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos to the network.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
The hacker who claims to have 100 other star photos leaked the naked pictures of Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence online.
A member of the Hunger Game Star confirmed that the images were authentic and condemned the hacker's "arrogant invasion of privacy."
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted.
The images originally published on the 4chan photo release site were apparently misplaced because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. A hundred other stars being hacked are claimed to have dozens of other women on the list, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed told us.
It is not known how much of these images are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those who look at the pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good feeling," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the "iCarly" and "Victoria" series of Niccodeon denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are INCREASED, don't you understand."
Let me put an end to this right now.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
We're the only one with the impression that Howard Jacobson has given thanks to a new novel about love and the letter "J"
They slipped, it was the best thing that ever happened, and gradually they came apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from a woman that he was too serious, too laborious, intense, detached, and perhaps a little petrified.
That's when he swung his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was spiky, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had been in the early stages of a relationship which, however, had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some substance into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair, and she was a delicate spiritual beauty with a joyous heart, from a village in the north that was even more harsh and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveler, who Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Auntie had inherited a house in a damp but Paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were old, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their tracks in the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, the garden grew weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, threatening and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week.
Kevern had been sitting hand-in-hand with Ailinn in a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to the receiver, through which the whole country heard the soothing music and the soothing news, as Ailinn's crossed, sun-tan legs brought Kevern's mind a song that had long since been sung by a black performer, and which his father had often listened to in the cabin with the tweezers down.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned - nothing was actually banned - they were simply no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, as did the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion produced what was not achieved by laws and proclamation: just as in the literature, people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances; they prefer ballads for music.
By day's wildness, Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing the serenade to the big legs of Ailinn with an arrogant comical voice.
Ailinna didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers naturally in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" got away from his lips.
It had begun a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start with J out of your mouth, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinna had never heard such a thing.
Jazz had not been specifically banned either, it was not just played.
The improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room in life for one "if" word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to witchcraft.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father's half-sister CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that she could not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion here either.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude - with gratitude, with gratitude, that they had been spared by luck - the principle that each group did its natural things.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean genitals are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally talented with electrical equipment, so it was their job to make sure that every family had a functional phone used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumber men; the last Greeks broke plates.
When SE, what happened, if it happened, those from the Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not escaped quickly in fear of being accused of burning flames and afraid that those flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving labneh yoghurt and burning a water pipe, and continued to look down on their lives, created and bored.
Let every man act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard the ballads, and it was hard for him to understand how the insulting words Kevern has just sung could ever be dressed as music.
It was through music that they expressed love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the Bigfoot.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinna still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
Ailinna thought he was weird already.
"Dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn shrunk her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing to see all over the world but Ailinna's huge, croissant hairbrush.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
The town of Ailinna seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only of spinal flowers, so he couldn't use it to cause the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what fascinates me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, unnecessarily cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinna decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinna think she'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in a good northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same vast, shaky sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, albeit more pale and diabolical than their smugglers and demolition grandparents, walked from pub to pub, ready to strike every woman who would dare to resist or tempt them.
Fat head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first - kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver - suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, because the suckling itself was hostile.
The body language of Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn was watching him go, just like his traveling companion was watching Kevern go out the window upstairs, a man who was the reason for his hard life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who turned his back, a bowler, a disgraceful, beaten man who had lost all the will to fight - why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he didn't remember seeing it once before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomon was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution in Ofnow, measuring the Common Mind, carried out a short study on the continuation of minor and moderate violence in the areas of the country where the reduction in violence, or even the end, was most likely to occur, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"Much has already been done, and much still remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggression of the people who fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the towers of church crossing the hedges, human kindness is rarely known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it gives rise to.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, devour stories of the victorious hardships and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps in its relentless grip on both rural communities and urban neighbourhoods, and there is also evidence of a new, more malicious willingness to fight in homes, workplaces, streets and even in playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put his eyes to the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbo sexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices at this workplace.
We are servants of an unprejudiced society.
Although a certain degree of hypersensitivity is, in itself, totally acceptable and respectful, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, to what you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the Church, and what you call cruelty or malevolence, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
If it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, it would destroy the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingo pink LED light declared a guideline that had already been distributed to the country by Ofnow for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, respect your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, not agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that were originally leading to what happened.
But this time, we will not leak our anger and our distrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe 'mistakes' as the acts that our grandparents may have done or not to do.
You also go too far when you say that they leaked 'their hatred and their distrust to others'. "
A person in a position like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no "us" or "others."
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that he has behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no further need to talk about it - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to make them.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going over your report," he said and announced that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose passing was described by the passers as "malicious and ferocious."
Accidents happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning an attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho military officials have refused to frame the attack on the government and said that they were working against a police officer who was suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and taken over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Head of State travelled with his family to a neighbouring country in South Africa after telling them that he had been threatened with death.
Major Ntelele Neti, the military representative, denied the attack and said that the army responded to a threat from "political fanatics." The police have been told that they tried to arm the fanatics.
"Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to the President of the South African Government, Clayson Monyela, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be in all respects equivalent to the characteristics of the revolution attempt," he says.
According to Lesotho military officials, soldiers return to the cashier's army on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he's being targeted because he's been trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements of the great coalition government.
This is how he denies disrespecting the power of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Trade magazine: Microsoft will set up a data centre in Uusimaa
The information technology company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Uusimaa where the company refuses to specify its location.
In a press release sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment for Microsoft of several hundred million dollars.
In the public sphere, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been placed as the seat of the Centre.
Microsoft stops its office in Oulu completely, which takes the job away from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft's Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on the number of staff employed by the new data centre.
The creation of the Data Centre in Uusimaa was announced on Monday by Kauppalehti.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different devices to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action-camera, such as GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other components are closed watertight.
In addition, set camera imaging settings to match images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setting to optimize the conditions under water.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure your device can take you deep.
Some cameras can only withstand 5 feet of depth, others can withstand up to 50-60 feet of depth.
Check out both regular and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital cameras reviews.
Take several pictures - many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose images, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see under the water, and it can either work or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forging, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is falling significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while filming in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is an important advice when photographing on the ground, but even more important under water because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object so that the object meets the full picture frame.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders - demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to elect candidates despite the growing unrest in the 2017 elections, which calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district after the activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China basically gives the Communists the power to remove all candidates who do not comply with Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says the Chairman of the Democratic Party, the legislator Emily Lau.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Mr Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime by saying that the general election of the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Great Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process rigorously through the Nomination Committee, which is administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the operation of the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and that they would create protests in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not give details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online newsletter, the organisers said that "the movement sees the Occupy Central trick as a last resort only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the invasion of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security was tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fuelled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of people from the mainland has created competition for products and services.
In addition, there is the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised Occupy Central because its protests threaten Hong Kong's living conditions - the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says Regina Ip, the legislator, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want there to be any concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
There have also been reports in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong's democracy activists are henchmen of the Western powers that incite the revolution. "
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the biggest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
US prom tradition hits British universities: new students with private jets
We are excited to respond to demand by setting up Britain's first luxury travel form for today's students.
The company offers not only a private plane but also other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable entry to the university.
Stewart says there's also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to their ends.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company representative, there have not yet been any reservations because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the next weeks."
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 per academic year.
Today's students are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago from their studies. It is now more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Association of Higher Education, "this service plan seems to be a very long way from the life of the majority of students."
Many of the students starting their studies this month are shocked at the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is lagging behind the huge increase in basic costs, and only then can we begin to wonder where we can find thousands of people to use for something as simple as getting to campus.

Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria showed their minds in front of the Ministry of Justice of the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to get back the old working rules that were recently amended.

Members of the Trade Union for the Workers' Party of the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join in the protest.
Baseball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Sal had fainted on the field
Baseball Sasu Sal was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget about his US match and beat the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his standing solutions.
But Sal moved all the glory to the Susifans and did it in style:
I was about to pass out at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, there was nothing I could do.
That noise and the white ocean was almost too much for me.
The power moments of Salin contained nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball stripping, disks and temming everywhere where it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow state that made it all work.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that everyone else caught up with the plot.
He grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team cheerleader and spirit creator, so no wonder his example raised the entire team to a flight that was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after 32 years of pause: The previous one remembered an outrageous game of judges
Heikki Montonen, who carried the bag (right), was the head coach of Finland at the World Cup in Argentina in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish illustrator in the 1982 tournament in Argentina where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosone and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday's: it was a hot match in the starting block against France.
"The game of judges was blatant in the decision balls of that match," said Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the rear line.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then more shit went crazy, "said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montose and eventually scored 17.
Now Finland is back among the world's choices when the World Cup in Poland is starting on Saturday.
There have been many changes in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster, "said Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the beginning.
Then it can get tough, "says Kosone.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a victorious match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a global player at the World Cup.
Let's hope this is the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down, "said Parkkali.
The species legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in the Tunisia match.

The Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen looked for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen told on the public Facebook update that the Cita dog that was with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little further, but its feet didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there wasn't any help from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from the passers.
By the time the night was dark, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini, the Tamperean, and Tuomo, his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpigen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells him in a message she sent to evening-saying.
Soon, a German man came along with a camping mattress.
The mattress gave Cita a stretcher like the one that got the injured dog attached to.
The German man showed up after us for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the hill for a moment, "says Soini.
Photo: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down by a camping mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry it in difficult terrain.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "international heroes" so that he could thank them again.
The chords answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, but Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and honor, I am forever grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They'd been getting a lot of happy news from Mikkelsen.

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought for most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a series of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and the spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms of motor disease, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and tenderness of the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedrich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers thought he'd be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and die before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, a 51-year-old mother with two children says, "When I was a kid, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in a different way than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. In the event of surgery, when the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I was 25, and in the meantime, I'd slowly lose all my powers.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they explained to me what CMT was, I thought I'd been lynched," he'll tell me.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, which was announced by the Ministry of the Interior on Monday.

The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has managed to keep sports successful with the help of talent plots in the municipality with varying success.

Crazy hired the assailant with the Hernandez Society's record.
Hull has invested the company's record in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, the national team from Uruguay.
Hernandez will switch from Palermo to Hull for 9,5 million pounds, approximately EUR 12 million.
It's a three-year contract.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and got into the Italian main series.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
Last summer at the World Cup, Hernandez came in two games to switch to the field.

On Monday, Hull told me that he also acquired the Senegalese captain of the national team, Mohamed Diamen, from West Hamm.
Russian space test failed - the gekos sent on a sex trip died.
The five little geckos sent by Russia into space for reproduction are dead, "says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency in its release.
Gekko travelled with a Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning for Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to examine the reproductive capacity and use of gecks in a non-weight-free state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Even though the test sounds unusual, it was meant to be serious.
There is little information on the effects of the absence of weight, for example on the development of geckos' eggs.
The effects on geckos can be used to anticipate the effects of non-gravity on man while he is in a longer-term state, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or causes of death of gecks will be determined.
According to Interfax, the passengers who were baptized as "sex geckos" were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fruit flies that travelled with the same photon-M4 survived the journey and also got a posterity.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a suspected terrorist at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to be a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him down after he had paid money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline didn't believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but called the authorities.
The authorities contacted her father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man's actions in the past.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people who have attracted wars in Iraq or Syria are also a safety risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or persons registered in France have travelled to, returned from or are planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball club for a follow-up are at stake when Finland meets today in the second match of the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening decision to the United States was expected, Ukraine will again belong to those countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits to follow.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Mr Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion three years ago.
From the Dominican Republic to the Republic, Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but yes, we've played against them before, and we need to get our standard defense up and running, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's defeat to the United States.
We need to find our own strength again.
I can guarantee you there will be a normal pack of wolves in the field, "Möttolä said.
The alleged nude images of the Hollywood stars are spreading online - some confirmed as genuine
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are alleged to represent well-known public figures.
Among other things, the actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "nude film campaign."
The entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted, threatened by representatives.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken these photos years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible effort was made to do this.
I feel sorry for everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes along the site.
On the other hand, Victoria Justice, the actor, says that images running under her own name are fake.
At least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Kristen Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer are also on the move.
The Honka goaltender criticises his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here."
Football Club FC Honka is currently in the final place of the Gaming League.
Goaltender Walter Viitala's comments after the Sunday VPS match are a good illustration of the chaotic state of the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But everything has to be adapted, "said Viitala, after the battle over 1-2.
Honka made a lot of defensive-head mistakes, especially in the first half of the game.
Goaltender Vitala wasn't happy about the bad defense game.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, which is why the defensemen in front of the Viitala have also changed at a high pace.
With the player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here once in a while," the Viitala blew up without naming any single player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Vitala.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately when their friends change constantly.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially at the end of the defense, people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position, "Mr Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, even with the second last TPS.
There are seven more rounds left in the betting league, so the EspoIans still have time to avoid falling into the First.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop a team now.
We are certainly not going to fall out of this show, "the goalkeeper Viitala threatened.

The first shops were opened in 2002.
From a participant in the Ice Bucket challenge, the jaw dislocated
British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when ice-cold water was poured on her, she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
She's been taken to treatment for her rugged Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jaw was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when they poured ice-cold water on her, she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold, I just screamed, but when I screamed, I felt my jaw start to get stiff," he tells the Mirror magazine.
They pour ice water on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mom and sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the superpopular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital where the jaw was placed back in place.
Video clips have become an Internet sensation and have been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View of wolf howling (kin): How can the growth of fans be explained?
I had a great feeling today.
This is what Sakari Pehkonen, the basketball player, said in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the EM final tournament in the Marouse ballroom in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were about one hundred Finns who cried out to 20,000 spectators, otherwise to an empty hall.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian World Cup.
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the number of Finnish fans.
The 1995 EM Games were the reference time for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki sports house.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttolä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölla to the final tournament team.
A solution that many people disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a wise man from far away, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball club went deep.
In Athens, there were a total of just over 100 Finns present.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into incomprehensible proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
No matter what the number is between here and there, it's an incomprehensible amount.
Here's some explaining to the sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses move across borders.
Sport still has the opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go to see how our girls and sons succeed in the world, "says Professor Hannu Itkonen.
There will certainly be Finns both in Spain and in the World Cup volleyball in Poland who are looking for experience.
We've had a lot of experience together.
It still doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself must also be attractive.
Crying brings sport into the popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to sports than Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will still not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time head coach Dettmann challenged basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
And then the direction changed, and the national team went up on the pedestal.
The volleyball crew made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top-level sports, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
That's when the audience gets interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Crying reminds me.
Can the ball species transfer this massive interest to the home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball play for hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Crying thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good to the species.
The other school thinks the interest will shift.
The other one is the one who doesn't want the sweets filled with stomach.
This group is ready to go to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic shows are not of any interest.
It's a challenge for society in the middle of a drug.
On the land of Bottas - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola awards Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach house.
At its meeting on Monday, the municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of a plot of 1.4 hectares.
In the future, a free-time apartment will rise to the property.
In Nastola, Bottas' success has been monitored since his kartings.
He will be seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a bigger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, of which six will be dismantled at the expense of the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas reached Formula 1 in the Belgian competition with his fourth prize ball player this year.
He's at the World Cup in fifth.
Bottas is a native Nastolan and lived in the Village of his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free of formulas.
Bottas has visited upper schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming, but I don't think it's for the poor.
It will present and test them in the US Open tennis competition currently taking place in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball players in the field, but also by amateur Marcus Giro, one of the top college players.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, which are transmitted to the mokula in the shirt and then to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breath rhythm, stress and steps.
The central hub shall be removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told you the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor have you even hinted about the price, the Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that puts on smart clothes.
California Athos has brought a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure the heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 a piece and the central processing unit the size of the thumb they require costs $200.
Red Orbit also wrote about techno clothes.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1 000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save money.
He developed a system in which students in subsequent years borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling the books straight away.
"My book on mathematics would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for it to be used throughout the semester as well as a toaster sandwich," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his books for the last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks so that they can use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, more than 250 Camping Book companies, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistical data on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookshops in the past spring were rental books, "says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are sourced from campus bookshops.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online shops
In online stores, you can only get a new book for one third of the price it would pay for a campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's ninth edition of the Calculus book is recommended at almost $290, but Chegg.com's special book online store receives $239.99.
Buy when used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn out appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is available from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's final year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says that he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Adverting Business" used in Amazon's online shop for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, Director of Amherst's College Without Walls, University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors whether previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rental
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you do not need them when you complete your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, accentuation pen, and charges for wear and tear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price.
E-books
Acquisition of e-books instead of ordinary papers may also be a question.
In some cases, these books are rented, paying the right to use the e-book to the holder, such as Amazon, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
You can get the "Calculus" book in an e-book for six months at the Chegg store for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most, because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
Compare different vendors pays off, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be starting Pepperdine in law school, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price, because it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in storage, says Gault.
He himself learned this hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he had to buy it at full cost at the university bookstore.

Nearly twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Civil Protection Organization (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires so far.
Last year, at the same time, there were 31 burns.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the last worse situation was in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in the fires.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and 7 in row houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of repeating home fire safety.
At least all home fire alarms should be checked according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is readily accessible.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all home spaces.
Children should also be informed of what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, some 150 people met at the so-called summit in Cardiff City Hall.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with protestors who had arrived even since Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia.
Two teen hikers were raised to safety after they were trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in the Australian New South Wales area.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went to Blackhead on Sunday after noon.
The families were concerned about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8: 00 p.m.
A search party of local cops and helpers was sent to look for young people, and the two were found around 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The cops spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been fiercely united with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to the military representative, the gunfire on the other side has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
Over the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Azores, a Ukrainian patrol ship that was hit yesterday in the south-east of Ukraine sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard didn't know where the ship was shot.
The Separatists told us yesterday in social media that they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw from positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Mr Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rainfall caused the floods in Malmö and Copenhagen.
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when heavy rainfall hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Flood waters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars under them.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take some time for the flood to stop, even though it was predicted that the rainfall would stop by Monday.
The heavy rains were caught by Swedish authorities and no weather warning was given in advance.
The Finnish Meteorologist Ari Mustala, an on-call officer at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the Saderstone that was plaguing the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" to the socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not give the French majority approval.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said and deserved a round of applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite the suggestion made earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Mr Taubira, the Minister for Justice, caused a dissension by showing himself at a meeting of the Socialist Members who expressed differences of opinion and by criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the constant division between the socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government in Valls would last for a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war in wars, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty it was to form a new government after the last one had not even lasted for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal to break up the parliament and considered the election victory of his party to be certain in the early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the extreme right held the top list in the May EU elections.
According to the opinion polls in Journal du Dimanche, which appear on Sundays, 76% of French citizens believe that the Socialist Party may be divided into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly see that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka betrayed the Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Sirana, Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
The Finland of Morning programme released a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday last Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, the hosts Kirsi Alm-Sirana and Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning of the next day's broadcast of the Finnish advertising pub, but the recording is not going quite straight.
Alm-Sihra goes crazy in her words when she tries to say the word "budget fight," and her confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their jobs time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, the morning of Finland's Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and distributed on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, worked at the photo office of the magazine, ranked third in the potter series in 1972.
This is the Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International in May 1971 was held at the building of the Building Champions on Fredrik Street in Helsinki.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and there were enormous security measures.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to describe it.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and the background were right.
I realized this time I did it.
You can see from the look on Meir's face that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful in taking pictures of known persons or events.
It's great that you can succeed with other pictures now, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best part is Lasse Virén's fall picture of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Opposition: Aarnio investigation has already cost more than EUR 5 million
Examination of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30 to 50 staff years.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation to the University of Jyväskylä.
Mr Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology allows multiple uses of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which information collected for the purpose of investigating a criminal offence is automatically electronic evidence that fills the evidence chain and at the same time allows for comprehensive legal supervision.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Upper: The 1999 idea of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school's wall: "Fish and chicken dishes are part of the vegetarian diet."
The picture of a special announcement on the wall of a Pirkkala Women's Tour School caused a food racket in social media, says Yle on his website.
The vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes are part of the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a plant option!
This is what it says in the 15-year-old press release, forgotten on the school wall.
You'll get to see the picture from here.
The image of the social media has led people to send indignant feedback to Pirkkala Municipality.
Arja Vaarma, Head of the Food and Purity Service, points out to General that the note left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has been an idea like this, which has been discussed with health care in the past.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to the General.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian alternative only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse on a vegetarian diet.
The risk justifies the solution to the General that young vegetarian trials may leave nutrition incomplete and the absence of meat or chicken may give rise to surprise from pupils' parents.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion in Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
With the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of USD 6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCLN) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private venture capital company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names in the public domain because there is no public consultation.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise based in Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when it was USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, sail under Ocean and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The USD 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since trade in 2007, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was set up in its current composition in 2000 when it was merged with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim [Thay].
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo for 20% and the private equity company TPG Capital LP for 8% from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruise and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North America's cruise capacity, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise at the time of the issue of the shares.
The Tampere City Council is working on it today.
Animal wishes the City Government to give strong support to this initiative.
According to Salla Juhkavaara, Director-General of Animalia, University of Tampere, who is preparing a doctoral thesis, it is necessary to end rapidly during the dolphins in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the retention of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is not ethically and ethically sustainable either in terms of animal welfare.
This view should also be taken by Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinarium is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination.
According to the risk of judgment, the death of Näsi-dolphin strengthens the requirements for delphinisation.
The death of Näsi is a sad follow-up to the dark history of the Särkkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a stop to death, to close the dolphin prison and to begin to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited maritime area, a sort of dolphin shelter, the Danger of Judgement demands.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the original dolphin habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkkänäiemi will have had more life than the uninspired concrete pool, the Doomsdag wishes.
The aim of the Animal Protection Union, Animalia, is to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the context of the ongoing reform of the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphinarios.
In support of this demand, the Managing Director of Animalia, Tuomivaara, will take part in the demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on 1 September today.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed annually, either for use by dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on the new state
On Sunday, President Vladimir Putin insisted that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the eastern parts of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the dissenting region, the Russian news sources tell us.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the separatist region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its role within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
The demand made by Putin to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiators is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to practically grant the newly declared Novorossa independence which enables it to head for Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to take back the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, controlled by separatists, which were occupied by separatists in March and April following Moscow's accession to the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossaja," "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of glory preceding the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are an "illusion" as long as the Ukrainian politicians are conducting campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and the government forces are attacking civilians in the separatist controlled areas.
"We must begin extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the State of South-East Ukraine, which takes account of the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Mr Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is linked to the wider independence that has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for months in trying to allay the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine."
The Kremlin representative's interim statement, which was intended to correct the "misinterpretation 'of Putin's comments, underlined that the Russian regime dealt with the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently than in the case of Crimea, thus effectively taking over an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to the pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population were in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practical power in an area linking Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is based on the Russian main fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the Russian region between Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, the Ukrainian President, Mr Petro Poroshenko, proposed in his inauguration speech that the Ukrainian legislators - following the new elections - consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside Ukraine's core region in terms of their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine earlier from a peaceful area along the coast of the Azores.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovski by separatists supported by Russia will be the start of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to a massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further action to prevent further Russian violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," said Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed additional sanctions to be imposed if the Ukrainian crisis erupted again in unclear circumstances.
Former so-called "Minister of Justice 'of the so-called" Donetsk People's Republic'.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Iloviski was replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda at the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was first hit and a little later, Jeremy Menez was kicked.
Lazio got a tough one at the end of the game after his narrowing goal, but the goalie Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the training debut at Inzagh, Milan's former attacker, the San Siro Stadium was only halfway there.
39 000 spectators were announced as the audience of the match.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's been dismayed by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood's A-list star Gabi Grecko's nude photos.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos have been released on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity photo hacking scandal.
Hacker has been told to hold 60 nude pictures of Starving Star Lawrence and other superstars such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York is reported as "disgraceful" in the online newspaper and said that the victims "feel disgraced."
