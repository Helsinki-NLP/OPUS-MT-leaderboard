We found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The announcement of the disappearance of a boy who left Western Tampere with his friend has spread through social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and has no life or health risk.
The boy's father told evening-saying that he knew he'd been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the afternoons.
The boy was found near home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, wild again, ripped the paint off of the Messis.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing also in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo about the goal of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the latter's advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time scorer statistics when he fired two hits on the visitor Shahtar Donetski's network of punishments and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his march to 80 when the Barcelona Messages, which had been tied up with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0 game.
Juventus has been stumbling in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the D-section of the Champions' League it started with a strong 2-1 victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored in good ten minutes before the end of Juventus's Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had no kneecaps.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's election league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
The second company of Manchester, United, also experienced great hardship in Holland against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old defenseman of the ManU, was only 15 minutes away from the game.
The dangerous-looking sliding tackle of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with the ManU package so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 wire by 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno paved before the break in extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Goalline period began the A-section of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the Argentinian Angel Di Maria who had changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and put the ball in the back corner past Malmo's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinburgh Cavani made a second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG's been betting on the season's success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met his professional career starting company Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost in the B-section in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president gave the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had made a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has made the same speech in the country's Parliament again at the end of last month.
Mr Mugabe apparently did not realise during his 25-minute speech that the speech was the same.
The speech aroused doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was full of spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe's staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech addressed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders for next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe's future registered more effectively.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of Ministers of the Interior.
The teacher admits to shooting her girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice is just a little color college teacher Shannon Lamb telling the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of a dead woman's next of kin could be found on his phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on the page of the book: "I am so sorry that I wish I could cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said a letter from experts that was signed by Lambi.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University of Cleveland in Minnesota, had already travelled almost 500 kilometres to the campus of the school where the police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Police Chief Lynn Buford, Delta State University, told me the university staff heard about the shooting at 10: 18.
He said that Lambi made a fatal 911 call a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the hare.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lambi's motive the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lambi as a talented teacher, but who may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for his lessons.
The police at Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, say that Lambi had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lambi in a book he wrote in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many pupils attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambi, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lambi told him that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's recruitment policy meant that, although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and associate professorship.
University headmaster William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lambi's mind."
These are the questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police got onto him when he went back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville in Mississippi, "says Detective Methel Johnson of Washington County.
Lambi's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lambi's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer around the time.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, now told 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburbs of Jackson in Brandon.
It seems that Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river bank in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told me they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had never met Lambi, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both appearing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several network companies.
The bartender and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, a shady bar near Gautier, says that he last saw Lambi and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica show to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We made fun of each other, and we used to throw things at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, told school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied the Kansas Emporia at State University and was the spearhead of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, Delta State campus, there was a candlelight exercise involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the mass during which the university choir sang songs from Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it does not hire as many workers for the holiday season as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that existing permanent workers and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to employ 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared to 45 000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews of applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holidays, the season of Christmas shopping is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was an extremely important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royalty to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to me, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the back in time trailer.
The movie starts and it reminds me that I'm just a fake shot and a hand stretch away from dating the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary on Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel locket of all time."
Back in Time is available in order video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The leader of the United Nations says that the situation in Syria will not be solved by armed means.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict will "not be resolved armed," and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the margins of the General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "made it impossible to resolve the situation."
He called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they demonstrated when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme in the context of the Syrian crisis.
8 support polls showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some people have tried to label him as a windshield.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to steal Donald Trump away from the top of the poll, it has not (yet) been successful.
Of the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means in terms of the appointment of the king of real estate.
Of course, the election season is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of which was able to get a single state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Society Club for Growth have noted Trump's tenacity and started using their funds to bring him down.
The following recent support poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support poll showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people say they take a negative view.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
Last week in Iowa, 60% of Republicans reported that they were positive about Trump in a support poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump were to become a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "happy" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "enthusiastic" versus 40% of Trump).
Next thing you know, it's the most exciting thing that ever happened.
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush was to become a candidate for power.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post poll 52% of the electorate on the Republican side at national level thinks that the property king has an appropriate quality of character for the president.
According to a survey by Quinnipiac last week, in the state of Iowa, which organises the first party meeting, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
According to the ABC / Post survey, however, 44% think that his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
The Republican voters are getting used to it.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN / ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option to ask who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be nominated as a candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe that the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans stood up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmentation of the field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as support for Trump has been divided among a number of other candidates.
However, a survey carried out by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just now, the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
The new CBS / NOW survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who is going to vote for them.
Of course, the situation can change and no one can be absolutely certain that they will never change their minds.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's grandeur drives Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and harms re-branding attempts.
According to a new ABC / Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in a Monday's ABC / Post poll that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than someone with government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
The Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey on Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "dissatisfied" and 21% are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corby will meet David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask about his first six questions a little after noon, and it is likely that both the media and the Labour representatives will closely monitor his performance.
Corbyn has insisted on this weekly show "less theater and more facts."
He has also said that some of the opportunities could be left to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand quietly during the National Song in the service of Tuesday's memorial service on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain Air War has aroused criticism among Conservative Members and has appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention.
The representative of Corbyn said that he was' standing quietly 'and that he recognised' the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War '.
A member of the Corbyn Shadow Board, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing a national song, despite the fact that he felt that the King's House should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and less than one sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the position of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "accumulated" within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At a meeting of the Trade Union Confederation, Mr Corbyn said that the Labour Party would propose a change which would remove the entire ceiling.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party was "quite clear 'in that they only oppose the government's plans to lower the ceiling from GBP 26 000 to GBP 23 000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met in the last decade when he has been the Conservative leader.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "spread" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, Member of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Hours is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both witty verbatim words and pedicures, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government's finance secretary, will replace him in Question Time when Corbyn does not attend - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at some point, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the Lower House, John Bercow, from the point of view of the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often associated with questions from the Prime Minister, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of the Director's judgment, of his subchamber management, and of his position with other Members, even though the critics have criticised the Question Hours for becoming a mere mockery requiring far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburgi: Homeless young people trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children has found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
"I was shot in Jobburg" is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound is rising as British wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers appeared to rise in Great Britain's wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by estimates of the rise in rates.
The pound rose to over one per cent against $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at an increase of 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and increased by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The share of Burberry rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
The latest sales figures for Richemont were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the miner told us that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The Group of Packaging and Paper Mondi's shares were among the largest indexes by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations from the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose by 3.1% since the sports clothing company published its six-month output before tax: an increase of 83% to GBP 46.6 million.
According to the Director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement.
Peter Cowgill, Director of JD Sports, says that if workers' minimum wage is raised in Great Britain, this may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, "says Cowgill.
The costs could be related to the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash will launch a grassroots campaign against the invasion of Aldi.
MetCash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the attack on Aldi in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and first trade early next year in South and West Australia, where up to 120 shops are coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food brokers and build IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer flavours in IGA's stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
MetCash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, since South and West Australia together account for almost 30% of the IGA trade area of Metcash, where the profit margins are higher than those of the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
In South and Western Australia, visitors are well known to be in a corner, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern countries.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first shops.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 25 stores in the south and 30 shops in the west next year, generating a turnover of between $500 and $600 million in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash approximately $13 million in operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and by 2.1% in 2018, from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "well possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas' comments.
It has been understood, however, that a member of the Metcash government would have contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen since 2010 from 18% to 14%, and the profits from Metcash's food and food business, which transfers products to about 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of activities when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesale seller stands by and has invested more than $150 million a year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products to the same level each week as Coles and Woolworth, helping IGA dealers to rehabilitate stores by increasing fast growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
The President of Metcash, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased the attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of increasing profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian tennis league, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism of his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered sideways in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism of his own behaviour, says Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian tennis league.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of a talented two called "Special KS," was unwittingly exposed to the case of Kyrgios annoying Stan Wawrink in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after this, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to split up Cockinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Cyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Cookinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unwavering defenseman of Cookkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second place in a duel with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into this mess," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has been extremely well-behaved, including in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature for 19 years of age, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is valued in the locker room, he exercises hard, is in good condition and is a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Cyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for all, but still supporting the Canberra's return to the standard equipment of the team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games rather than all the controversy around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as the Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he's grown up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and deserves everything he's got with criticism. However, we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public domain thinking about these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrest immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of blocking the flow of immigrants coming to the country.
The border was followed by chaos when hundreds of immigrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence in their own countries have now set up their tents and set up for an indeterminate period of time between inspection posts in two countries.
However, frustration increased.
While the police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants were saying "Open the border!" and shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was' unacceptable 'to return migrants from Hungary when more and more of them were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion at the border between Hungary and Serbia arose following the failure of the 28 faction of the common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers were hopeful to reach a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and made it possible for you to be closed down and for asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also intends to set up a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottlenecks and the largest entry point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are at war in the run from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or harm a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency," the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the town of Szeged in the south.
We are very clear on this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the military deployment expected for next week, but the suppliers of the Associated Press at the border have for days seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Mr Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said that 45 people had been caught by the authorities trying to cross the border, and 15 people who had already reached a country further away.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now captured by the police, and are accused of offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near the Hungarian Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds tried to intrude.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's management of Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in two-digit leadership in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders is blackmailing him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democrats (down from 58%), while the second Sanders (up from 17%) are supported by 27%.
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether or not he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the Democrats' voters.
More than five months before the opening of the pre-election, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choices more rigorously than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is very much in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the democratic electorate of under 50 has been lost, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly in charge of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders runs this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic electorate in the country says that they will be keen to support Clinton if he becomes a candidate for the party.
The quarter says that it will support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The opinions are more confusing for those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
While 48% of Democrats say that they would be eager to support Clinton, the Republican top man, Donald Trump, says the same thing by fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had appropriate experience (16%), and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the post (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President will influence a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of the democrat electorate would like to see him in the race - even if one third disagrees.
When asking the democrats who they would choose as the second party to be appointed, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's management of Sanders will increase. If Biden goes along, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, it will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this measure Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most vote has increased.
However, when the democratic voters were asked what was most important in the candidate, they put their opinions before voting.
Last month, too, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered as an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well on certain key issues among the electorate of their party.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden does the best thing for the three in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of the democrats say that they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their public opinion about him.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after it came to light.
The majority of Americans say that their overall opinion of Clinton was not affected by e-polemics, although 36% say that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him to be honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country also do not think Trump is honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but a lot of people don't have an opinion on him, just like they don't have an opinion on Carson.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaching Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times poll
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
The Republican electorate across the country is still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has increased from 23% to 27% of the previous CBS survey, which was published on Tuesday before the Fox News election debate last month.
At the same time, however, Carson rose sharply from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among the various demographic groups and is taking over Trump among the higher-level Republican electorate.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% last month to the current 2%.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey conducted in September is + / - 6%.
Last week's CNN / ORC survey showed that Carson is up in the polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
According to the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the death of the student at the fraternity clam ceremony in the Pocono Mountains district of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been charged against five people.
In September 2013, members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the accession rite, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police noted.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were blindfolded and his back was loaded with a bag of sand over 13 kg, and then he was repeatedly tackled to the ground when he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he blacked out.
The fraternity members didn't call 911 after Deng passed out, but they said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, "the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to look online for information about his symptoms, and to contact the national chairman of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, asking for his advice, Commissioner Chris Wagner told us at the press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the brotherhood's well-being before Michael Deng," said Commissioner Wagner.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt force trauma to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternity clutches, as at least one student has died as a result every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand jury in Monroe County argued that the first five members would be charged with murder in the third degree.
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violent shredding and criminal plotting.
"We do not just want individuals to be held accountable. If there is an organisation behind this that either formally or unofficially accepted the situation, they must also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood unconnected with the local department.
This is what happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates.
Interest rate increases will come and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will fall.
Here's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past gives little help with timing, particularly as regards the economy.
The arrival of the recession has taken only 11 months after the first lifting, while sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The US Central Bank's aggression in raising interest rates has often, albeit not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the officials of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the development cycle of the period of normalisation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants will be able to see that all the fuss related to interest rate increases has been overdone.
"The first increase in the Central Bank after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," said Julian Jessup, Chief Financial Expert for Global Affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to normal, albeit still low, levels to be such a revolutionary shock that many seem afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it will not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some economic sectors will react in the light of past developments:
As has been seen on the market over the last month or so, waiting for interest to be raised may make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," the analysts in Deutsche Bank said in a recent study about what would happen after the Central Bank's increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% as the increase approaches, 250 days later the situation is fairly steady (an average increase of 2,6%), and the normal situation has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14,4% over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, Bob Doll, published in Barron's Journal.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle when the profits start to fall.
The recession is part of the economy, but interest-rate purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges which have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case for gross domestic product, which will be the closest to its ever lowest level before the Central Bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP of 118 withdrawals since 1950 has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it will be maintained when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic situation may be risky and raises the question of "whether this time is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been prepared to raise the Central Bank throughout the year and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the futures trade predicts only a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that, since 1950, all cycles of increase have so far appeared in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
At Nyquis, the central bank has been waiting by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now 74 months.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market is waiting for an increase in interest rates, and the model is somewhat similar to the findings on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are reflected more quickly in debt securities than in shares.
The direction of the yield from the debt books appears to change immediately at the first increase / cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, the bond yields will drop immediately, "said Deutche Bank.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that raising interest rates will lead to a convergence of yields for longer and shorter-term debt, thus equalising the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about looking for a return," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's fixed return analyst, in an analysis.
Surprised, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are a number of signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more steady, the credit margins have increased and the volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
In general, companies with business activity mainly in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high debt performance is worse when the rise in the dollar's value makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than their funding.
"History shows that" high-quality "shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in their customer report.
Companies with a strong turnover overcame the low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than those with lower quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with high variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
savers can also make profits with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham is accusing the channel of "popular awareness"
He claims that it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just mimicking the Brit Awards.
My fellow Member, Damien Collins, criticised the Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing the pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the leaders of the BBC that the public service radio channel seemed to be "popular 'and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3... I don't want to use the term" popular consciousness... "is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards seems like a different name from Brit Awards.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly, when in fact you are simply copying something that is already on the market, "Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denounced the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor as regards live music and the provision of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Conservative Tory MEP, Damien Collins, criticised The Voice, the music contest BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this program of the BBC1 channel, where the star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, were produced "quite BBC-style."
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time he started the entertainment series.
He did not, however, agree to prevent the production of the "The Voice" periods in the future, or to impose that the funds of the licensees should be used for other forms of entertainment.
Net sales rose least so far in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month the rise was lowest since the beginning of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that the November Black Friday may contain consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling-off of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent of last year's increase.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling-off of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to the year 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened as buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be done in different environments, such as a sofa.
But now it equalizes, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing trade.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers went to their computers to grab stores and knock down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got buyers to argue about discoveries, can control shopping.
A study published by British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains for shopping streets.
Muslims bury the victims of Mecca's crane accident, sanctions against Bin Laden's family.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during their first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 The dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in the Mecca Grand Mosque.
Mainly white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to the Al-Moisissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place where just a few days ago the crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family building group was responsible for the disaster, in which 394 people were also injured.
29 of the worshippers killed by a crane in the Mecca Grand Mosque were carried across the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton in Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a big mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency said that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The service of the news agency in English did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman swore to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the later hajj pilgrimage this month.
The Binladin Group has not published communications on the collapse of the mischief and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Mecca Grand Mosque, which are part of the huge building block that is run by the Binladin Group.
The family of Binladin has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place only days before millions arrived in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million Rials (£174 000) to be paid to the relatives of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B & Q boss says that cheap working workers in Eastern Europe are behind the popularity.
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, "says Veronique Laury.
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, the Screwfix shops for professionals will open up 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores all over the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's main correspondent for Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do housework.
It seems that if you're clever with a hammer or a hammer to paint walls, you're now in a minority.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B & Q.
The new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the home improvement chain, Veronica Laury, said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they are offering their services at a despicable price.
This means that Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix shops for workers and close 60 B & Q stores.
She said that she wanted more women to work at B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households where more housework is done than before.
She said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process. "
She is one of the five women who run the most important companies in the UK's FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt her management team with the same number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with an equal number of 50% women in the group, including its Director-General and Finance Director.
She said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board. "
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' output and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the shops.
As a result of the trend, the Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q stores, is opening 200 new shops
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other employees' organisations began to be forced on the same day and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread expression of workers.
There are quite a few people who think that there is common sense.
Let's see if it's worth taking a strike when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50 000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
At an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declaring a rich person would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not take much time, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the strong solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from the sky.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling around with their own weight, we are finally getting to the point, that is to say, the workers' rights to defend, prominently and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to put the role of the ay movement on hold, as membership of the trade union may perhaps be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the opinion of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
High savings for Lappeenranta University: €8.5 million in savings, 130 fewer staff
The Lappeenranta Technical University will start a course of savings aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start working negotiations on staff as a whole with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The core negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by government cuts.
In this financial year, the university makes a deficit of around 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding in our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the university newsletter.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding is now evident in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks under the law.
Yle: Onnbus wants to go to the Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, from Britain, tells General that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, says Souter.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is short-distance traffic in the Greater Helsinki region in 2017-2018.
After long-distance traffic, long-distance traffic is on the way.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed its interest in rail transport, which also has bus and rail services in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The central bank of the United States has to make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching the US Central Bank meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
As Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which the central bank has the opportunity to get off the zero level and start normalising interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Senior Fellow.
The US economy has been operating relatively well and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for the lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
The shooter from Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting her colleagues on the same day later, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and hoped that he could cancel it, "said the authorities on Tuesday.
The police at Gautier, Mississippi, told me that Lamb called 911 at about 10: 00 in the morning, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University.
On Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police have to send officers to his home.
He said "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone," but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a hand-written message from a 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me. "
After he wrote the message, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
University headmaster William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lambi and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lambi's mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any kind of "triangle."
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
The couple got divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "shocked."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "just the best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lambi for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told me that Lambi called her relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "she's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and went to run into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb debated educational science in Delta State in spring 2015, explains the CV available on the University's website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double break in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defenseman remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal wishes Shaw could still play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless attack on Héctor Moreno at 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
She was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what's gonna happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in a block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee made a mistake.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The British defenseman has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship next June in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out because of an injury like this, everyone will be very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he was on the Mexican team against Van Gaal Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle it.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry. "
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after he was challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't take long before you almost learn it from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a text published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 version of the film, in which new characters and details were added to fill out a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Vapille, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win over the girl of his dreams by filling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story that was not written by Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, right called Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds as if it was taken from the itinerary of the movie Lorax on the Internet Movie Database website, which starts as follows: "In the city of Vaitlen, within the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams for Audrey's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In that young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-pounding and needless Kerskane, ignoring the short, mouthful creature named Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible public relations mission is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I do not think it is likely that the last 3-0 series loss will happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a guest victory.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than a team three years ago, but it involves good spin-offs and has a strong way of thinking: they have no scars since 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in her rounds and Adil Rashid is an assailant option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the English cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good attackers against challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are criticised for their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't do as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is a team player first and foremost.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got a chance to play both at home and in guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a batter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must at least be given the same opportunity as others before him, but this obviously depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moene in a punch opening next to Cook has been boasted, so we can get an extra pitcher on the field, but we can keep four fast, and I am not against that.
I don't understand why a batter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he's three for them and there's little difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games at the first fall of the mop before he went to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team as a backup pitcher, and, little of what I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unembellished statistics, hitting average 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many pitchers, and the voters chose young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
Appointment of Mahela Jayawarden, the Sri Lankan batter, as a consultant in games may prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings with him an enormous amount of experience because he's done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes with the white ball games and brings with him both energy and a relentless fade.
I've always thought that he was born to be part of an international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of intelligent to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can jog the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting on one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on light grounds.
The British leaving the EU (Brexit) can make a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-walled renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are faced with ever greater problems every day, even without taking into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the fact that the Trade Union Confederation is angry with Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatic fellow recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the British egocentric agenda, full of disagreements and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not want to see for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Trade Union Confederation decided that it would not want them either if they were to undermine social protection.
Maybe we could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then coming home saying that they will win supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the British EU tent - 'Do not leave us alone with France', from Berlin - is saying that the shortest-looking ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they do not care about staying, then we leave.
The careful and moderate Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her business before it goes to waste in the same way as it did to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) who have been gone too long.
France's François Holland will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of the Selfiebritts, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests that some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 British referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation had been arranged and the renegotiation had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptical the exclusive powers of the press are, which were not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU direct bananas" when he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a wide range of tax-alienating goons, phone hacking foreigners and persons with a name elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a thirsty gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of a diversion if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair herself, as regards the fight against Cameron's renegotiation, because he had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly clapped me on the back of Westminster's Parliament on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of readopting Neil Kinnock's' 80s boycotted Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marri, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the UK Independence Party's Ukip war goal enthusiasm and the Conservative Party's most ferocious nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this on radio and on TV this week when his internal scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the rugged John McDonnell shadow minister of finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father was playing on TV, trying to be disloyal to his Labour Government colleagues, without going so far as to lose his government.
Hilary was more attractive to me.
But the fight to keep up "in any situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts, what Corbyn told the leaders and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24 / 7 television, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, the fundamental circulation of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-controlled economy and their anticapitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of minor differences is a central dogma in the educational quizzes.
With regard to his dual division with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats must simply try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the cost-cutting Conservative Government is in power, as I was reminded of at the start of Monday's British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticise the Public Health England e-tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-tobacco is 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had contacts with the tobacco industry.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lanceti to criticise the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-tobacco.
PHE published this "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial statement which attacked the main conclusion of the PHE against the 'exceptionally shaky bottom'.
Two other scientists who wrote on BMJ have wondered whether the allegations were "built on rock or on sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim that "according to the current best estimate, e-tobacco is about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco 'is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria decision-making analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General was previously funded by Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting indicated that they had received funding from the manufacturer of e-tobacco, but not the funding that was reported to have been received earlier from Philip Morris International, the tobacco company.
The selection criteria for panel members are not provided, but there are a number of well-known e-tobacco supporters in the panel, some of whom also indicate that they have received funding from the sector in the study.
Others are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco of the PHE.
The study produced by the group "eloquently admits" that there is a lack of "conclusive evidence of harm in most products and in most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that "so far there is no evidence that e-tobacco acts as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers' is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that the arguments put forward in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about tobacco compared to relative risks.
Almost 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoke costs NHS GBP 2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" such as this series of soap on Albert Square Street.
Mr Johnson said that licence fees should only be used for programmes which are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcasting times against the most popular programmes of competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years at a time, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea of the BBC producing and sending programmes that are clearly suitable for unsubsidised competitors," said Johnson to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its study of the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not and do not produce.
The Voice is being sent to the most important broadcast time, because it wants to raise as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly within the house implemented.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I do not understand how it is about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all. "
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is responsible for hunting audience numbers "because of the objectives of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC would sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of the smaller public in the BBC "go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can, in defending the fee revenue of GBP 4 billion, hypocritical say that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one is looking at'.
They'll put them in an embassy where no one will ever come to see them.
With regard to the fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for those people who have £150 a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
The former leader of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reassess its role at the time of Reith "to inform, train and entertain."
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said that the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be modelled on Australian and Canadian broadcasting and that it should be transformed into "information, education and entertainment."
With regard to the partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which he said are only shown on television for a few years, and to join with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows the control of brain cells by means of sound waves.
The video shows how the shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified neural systems to control them with sound wave discharges.
The tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound pulse that is too high to hear from the human ear.
The impulses function by switching on genetically modified nerve cells with membrane channels responsive to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The scientists said that worms show the functioning of a new method, called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
A scientist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, Sleekath Chalasani, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure leading to electrical impulses into the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes normally did not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic tiny bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified the ultrasound waves, which then go into the worms.
Confirmed ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, as described in the Nature Communications report.
In order to produce ultrasonic nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they turn on the modified nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that songenetics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be transmitted via optical fibre to the desired site within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue without hindrance, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to temporarily induce the target human nerve cells to react to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
The commercials put Britain's arms trade to shame.
Check out Amnesty International's anti-gun show.
Horrible killer machines!
Leg-crushing cuffs!
Grape bombs!
And electric stun bumps that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the graphic language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this ad of the world's largest military trade fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to the oppressive governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExceL Centre in London Shipyard.

A separate campaign also led to the emergence of many posters for bus stops and metro trains, which require more detailed information.
"Important information, do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together you will be asked using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
In this September, a pack of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade.
These 300 posters were produced by artists whose work was displayed at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Design (the Museum of Cruel Plans).
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Pack" packages. It is a six-pound pack of hexagon keys that collectively say "access to a third of the advertising space of the entire planet's bus stops."
Transport for London has not been amused by this unauthorized 'poster vandalism'.
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Design Curator and the University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists on resistance fronts when they realise that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets commuters on the subway.
The video of Amnestyn has been viewed through Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created by the free advertising agency VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and background reporter who worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director, Matt Leverin, discovered that there was no advertising at all at all of the military fairs - and there was also an empty point in ExCeL's calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of obscure corporation, but "it was more stoppable to highlight it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL, as the exhibitors trade fantastic embellishments.
Saab revealed in his press release that he received an order from the United States Army for a "shoulder-to-shoulder launch AT4CS RS."
This includes "a unique plumber point that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm.
It's been 11 years since I moved to a college dorm when I was 19, and I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forceful smile of the people I annoyed and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorm could be anything from getting to nerves to completely scary.
It's tempting to brag: tell me where you come from, whether you liked the middle year, and where you think about Corby, and why "I really don't love Marmite or hate Marmite because it's really just a yeast extract HAHAHA I find in my room."
Take a breath.
And also help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the ones you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they will share the fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People's rooms are often turned into cocktail parties, movie evenings and general entertainment places, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.

College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but many homes form a culture of moving from one room to another, which is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to get some rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you must now leave so that I can recover the energy I consumed while I was talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When I heard the talk of knocking, knock.
A guy in my dorm thought if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting the university during the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate kettle and introducing yourself seems to be somewhat less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will link your face to a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
The poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to only make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
I understand taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk and check it out.
It's possible they'll give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more fully than my roommate who mixed up his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise so people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that verbatim spade of a kettle.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was 3: 00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut up at 5: 00 in the morning, the girl was kind enough to let them sleep for two hours before she put her own music on, locked her door and went on a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same dorm with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you kept your roommate as your future spouse, clung together, split up, and then you'd see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your industry.
In that joyous moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it's reversible in the moment.
You can teach me a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, then put them in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker at most twice.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - A house planned for reception in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made at the foreign student shelter in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors' asylum seekers, but the dormitories of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer, says Heidi Luukkinen, teacher of the Evangelical School of People's Studies in Kiten.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the People's Academy were tampered with by racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, "says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, the teacher responsible for youth guarantee training at the National Academy, there were approximately ten people at the time of the attack in the building that was being vandalized.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the National Academy.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as minor asylum seekers who have just arrived.
All the people in the mess building have "A" status.
Some study in basic adult education, some in vocational studies and some study Finnish, "says Luukkinen.
The status A is a so-called continuous residence permit which can be issued for a period of four years for a foreign person who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, a press conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We have had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened, "says Luke.
Luke says the mess's been cleaned up already.
At least three men were suspected of being involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think that this is the whim of the youth weekend, when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, "says Luke.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been tucked into which a reception centre is planned.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on its website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written "You are not welcome."
A police report has been issued.
Revision 15 September at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y-train for Karjaa - the passengers in starvation, "totally idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karelia stops running in March.
The news made passengers indignant at Helsinki's main railway station when the train took off early in the evening.
In particular, the run-down strikes the people of Bengtström, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
This is idiotic because the number of inhabitants is constantly growing and those working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video from HSTV he'll come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main track will be merged into a new R line.
Puola station in Järvenpää and Nuppullinna Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry will purchase train traffic in the following contractual period.
The contract period will be changed at the turn of the year and there will be routes to end throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, the Blessing, considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's the remorse.
The Y-train is also used by non-Raasepori and Blessing people, because it is fast and bypasses multiple stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling further away from the city.
"It is a misery for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he was in pain on the Y-train.
A little relief is coming.
A new train connection is expected to take place at the beach track, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y train, although the Ministry has much more than that.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts will double in Ainola and Sauna Rock.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made during the period when the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in 1867-1894, written by Yrjö Hakanen, a former chairman of GDP, today's book, the timeliness of Marx's Capital.
"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and fictional capital have proved to be astonishingly far-sighted.
A book based on capital seminars organised by Hakanen can also be found on the list of authors of the Aalto University Professor, the prestigious financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is "now and forever."
But the former President-in-Office of the Institute of Business Research and the Delegation to Business is not Marxist, is it?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The common idea is that the history of the Atheism is about the false opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing the interests of Marxi, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire those who want to understand the big picture of the world that is changing as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow won't help Marx.
After all, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be put to an end.
Still, it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," says Korkman.
"Maoists and Trotskis and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind world, as well as other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is demanding war criminals for a conviction in Sri Lanka.
The UN calls for the establishment of a specialised court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, says AFP.
The UN report on the 1983-2009 civil war appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
The Sri Lankan Civil War is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
Even the number of victims is not exactly known.
In particular, the major attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighting.
Both parties have been reported guilty of murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of a UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In England's yo-test, you got to pluck social media.
On Wednesday, a long foreign language, which was English, was on the books of the autumn.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media if you wanted to.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the editor of the web-site advisory forum.
The title was "Dear Agony Aunt."
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of a Finnish Leelian chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
The total number of subjects to be covered was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the most difficult of them," assessed the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck said, was pretty nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts such as the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
Autumn writings will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish, Swedish or Finnish test will be in place.
In high school, the experiment is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' demonstrations.
The Student Qualification Board calls on the candidates to find suitable access in time for them to attend the examination.
Even more time can be obtained if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence of its own.
In Oulu, a store was robbed at gunpoint.
In Oulu, a store was robbed on Wednesday morning in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a mask covering his face.
He's normal-body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, he had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from the rest of Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will block downtown Helsinki on Friday, predicted by the police.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, for their part, are not only responsible for the alarm and other police activities, but also for ensuring the success of the gigantic demonstration.
The roads leading to the railway line will be closed off from motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30 to 14 a.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off from the road circle of Kaisaniemi, from the direction of the West from Mannerheiminee.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on police business.
According to Kujala, support patrols are coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell you the exact numbers of patrols.
"A little bit is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With the arrival of protestors from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Railroad.
The buses are pretty far away, in principle.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the demonstration site, "says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops the public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally present at these big people's gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, violence is ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good comparison point in Finnish political history, "says Emritus Martti Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
As such, it is no wonder that the ay Movement is protesting.
If it did not do so, it would raise its hands in front of the government, "says Sistine.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is lacking in contract law.
There are many features here that are really trying to get the ay movement on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the demonstrations on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the Ay Movement would like to see involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament building in November 1993.
If you look for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a week in 1993, "Säisäinen says.
In the middle of the recession, a total of 20 000 unemployed people gathered together on MurroThursday.
Esko Aho's (central) government is stumbling from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay Movement may be even worse than it was at the time of the Murrosdag.
Besides, the worst bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, "Sisainen says.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so strict right-wing, despite the speeches of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the crash.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
It also stops public transport and may close kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the indivisible support of employees, it can become the largest in many years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the Finnish day-to-day demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is obedient to the law.
The protestors are trying to avoid harming or destroying property, "Sistine says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The strike for firefighters lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electrical strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and power strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended with the presentation of the Reconciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Fracture Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of them made redundant, met in front of Parliament's House to show their support for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg egg production by farmers protesting against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For the spa, the farmers were dripping tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
The operation threatened with a strike and collective redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies finally accelerated the outcome of the negotiations.
The doctors were on strike in 2001.
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors' strike lasted about five months and resulted in a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched from the Senate Square to the Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013 for study support.
The Central Criminal Police are investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the background to the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The guys on the truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, "says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the Broadband, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug dealer, and a wealthy businessman, the story of five smugglers.
A gigantic king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at Trento University, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and their book The Travel Agency of Death will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different levels of business.
The HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The islands of Kerkenna on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are going there for the summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain-burning captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for fishermen to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
After one trip, Emir makes about EUR 8 000.
Emir has five deputies looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisian wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis brought about another collapse.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers are just about to survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
There's a lantern going into the water at midnight.
The first night you drive off the islands, then you stop, wait for the day, and then you drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is going back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least he claims to beat the hell out of them.
He tells in the book that once the police snapped at him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
I hear he's got to beat up his fellow countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter engine is pulling its last few, and it's seen its best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi moves at all and moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly admitted.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without family are accommodated in tents, carpets and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
Families also live in the forest, who for one reason or another have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovasha area, to the great hub of human smuggling, people are exhausted.
Goran's cytans are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he tells in the book.
"They say their business once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Foolish fool fool all the way.
First, the price is set at EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice man with a good heart.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, "he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only EUR 50 per person on the Hungarian border.
It's about 100 miles, most of it's comfortable on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran makes about EUR 50 000 a year.
It's not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care; he knows the ways and the shortcuts, and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and shouts away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the missionary preacher, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where there are many believers fleeing the Congo, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he does the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants gently peers under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and goes on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the five number numbers of the missionary.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money wisely and to infiltrate the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the authorities of Uganda must be informed that they come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have had to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and replaced.
That's where the missionary contacts with the Uganda Police Department help.
The client will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, ultimately the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows red tape because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He invokes each step separately: an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process to a European country, for example, between EUR 4 500 and 7 000.
Foils and ice cubes
Tom is a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on call on the French coast in Calais, where it is his job to load people into trucks on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghan driver in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truckers who may not even know they're in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 freeway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting here for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's on its way to England and not even to Holland... and cut off the safety wire on the protective cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in an aluminum foil similar to the one that is wrapped around a roast or an oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping that he won't be driving a sudden stowaway, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
A gigantic Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal landings of the Mediterranean, who controls maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only wants the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are renting yachts to take American or European families to a comfortable tourist cruise for a few days.
In reality, ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghan people who are transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000 first from Istanbul to a port of land and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People get stuck in minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Marine Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink will be given, but the less the passengers will poop and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, tenants and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer period, transport will take place at least hundreds and Küçük will make millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments through cover companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner who competed three times in the Olympic Games, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, is about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts in the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran for the second best time in qualifying.
But in the finals, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership in a manic race.
But 150 meters before the goal, his powers were exhausted.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line. Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also overtalked his husband into accepting his actions.
Favor Hamilton's fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury heap.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was also that he missed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received when he was competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's number one statistician in the time of 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympics.
The champion of the world rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straight Back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have twisted the whole summer and autumn, like last year, from a sports contract.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for many times the world champion and the Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming period.
The decision was praised by a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the season of the national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent an alliance that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to play solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the Union has given Northug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured us that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the World Cup and then at the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in his career, two gold medals.
Last winter in Falun, he was on the team that won the gold.
Translator's tortoises are also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25.9, there are stunts in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Shifter Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food competence and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but that the top restaurants, which are controlled and classified by an impartial operator, are available throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event reflects the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the tortoise restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondikse and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town takes part in a tortoise day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most important international events that take place throughout the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of Kauhava Admission Centre
The Office of Immigration and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a reception centre for refugees in the premises of Kauhava's ex-garrison, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent presence in the region of critical infrastructure during the crisis period at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Special Networks Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Airline School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
In the case of Kauhava Airport, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The issue has been discussed with Mr Jussi Niinistö, Minister for Defence, and Mr Arto Rädy, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The town council of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Ninekistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought together all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially at these times when we face major challenges
The situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and hence in the Baltic Sea region.
The Nineparty is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to have an impact on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Nineteen, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Only emergency vehicles shall be allowed to enter the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from morning traffic to night traffic.
The Association of Trains and Metro staff informed the STT last night.
Most Alks close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Post services.
Significant delays are expected, inter alia, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
It is also intended to deal with food transport and hospital deliveries and laboratory samples.
Information about the services can be found on Post's website.
On Friday, most of the Finnish Alkas close their doors for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11: 00 and 13: 00.
Pam has also called for the participation of the workers of the grocery trade in trade in trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell the Helsinki Sõms that they are trying to keep the shops open, if necessary, by the power of their superiors.
According to Kesko, there is still no information on the possible closure of individual transactions.
Helsingin kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki day care centres are not fully operational on Friday, informed by the Helsinki Early Education Agency.
Due to the expression of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and there will be no club activities for day-care centres and playgrounds.
Day-care centres around the clock and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of the disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Education Agency promises to provide further information on the changes in activity tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among the others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become repeated.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be transmitted on Yle's channels in the future.
If you sign up for another channel, we'll see.
Now we use this channel tonight, said Sipilä.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to the public.
This dossier, which we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
Speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also view it in the Yle Areena.
The onion is taking a big risk.
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about the more general inward turn of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and to refuse questions from a public debate?
Reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he is not following the media agenda and not allowing it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not interrelated.
Kovunen understands that commercial media is indignant at the announcement by Sipilä.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers do not form part of democracy.
It is the role of media representatives, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agents are not taken into account.
According to the birch, the television talk is a big risk to Sipila.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more of what we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Kovunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
There is also a risk in this respect, if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be marked as a means of communication between politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general approach.
A clever move from the onion.
In the forthcoming speech by Mr Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister has not said is emphasised by the media scientist.
In the evening you should look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where she is not, "says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the Kuutti, the TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because this way he can bring out his own view without any sound of gravel.
In this way, the message will be given to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
The onion passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions will be asked.
According to the bullet, it's very important how Sipilä plays on TV, currency sweat, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila with a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform us about something, because here, it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and its partners are doing on a regular basis (President Barack of the United States).
Very exceptional.
The political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the public.
He said that it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that is ahead of him.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says that Sipilä could take his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announced that he would challenge the Sipilä dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy is dead and his father updated his Facebook page.
The police department of Sisä-Suomi also confirms this to the evening newspaper.
The kid went out to play around 4: 00 this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed with the violent wildness of young people: you will bring anger to you
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish fighter, published a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people from a migrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani said he was going to press against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of the free match.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos uploaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in young people's craziness.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick people in the country, sit on each other's heads, and punch without thinking about the consequences of this when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people who appear on the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Commissioner of the Helsinki Police, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting on the street at all.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, as my Turkish Amirkhani reminds us.
Mr Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come up with an awful lot of things.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
That's a different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhan urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by any kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for that.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate that I don't like either.
You guys are pretty bad at it anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, Amirkhan decides.
SAK puts forward its position on the savings package - Lly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, says that the Workers' Association will consider on Monday its position on the alternative savings list proposed by the STTC.
Lauri Lly commented on the STTC's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the STTK delegation announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akaka are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the main employee organisation, SAK, soften its previous position.
The Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, said little on Twitter.
Mr Lyle writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyle, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock," and that instead of forced laws, agreements by active parties are needed.
Mr Lüly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä terminated the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: The big demonstration is threatening to get fat - "It feels a little funny to get a fist."
After all, it's kind of funny to put your fist on if you already have a tissue paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the wage and salary camp.
Are we going to call the government off, or are we going to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK broke out their holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be caught.
The threat spread even to the Akakaans.
The teachers' trade union, OAJ, threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), President of the STTK, appeared in conciliation.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) as a 5% productivity leap.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder (Kok), rushed to announce that his conciliation paper was already ready.
There wasn't a sound from the SAK office at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reconcile when, just on Monday, the federal leaders told us to put the country on a stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Mr Lüly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a joint performance of employees, the SAK would have to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, Director of Social Destruction of the STTK, Jukka Ihanus used to serve as special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Mr Palola therefore described the fact that the government's ay skills have been constantly improving.
Coincidence or no coincidence, but Palola's output took a little bit out of the Finnish standing-ups, whose foreprint is the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put your fist on if you've already got a tissue paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information on Lyle's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, at which Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Summit in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Mr Naryshkin, to appear on the European Union's list of sanctions - something that the President was able to remind journalists of.
We estimate that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Interfax, the news agency was stressed by Mr Naryshkin.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Mr Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, as declared by Mr Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation made it to Mongolia without any difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to stab Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), the head of the meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already spoken to the Russian delegation according to Russian media.
The lock meets the true playoff troll: "Paints tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue the oxen days in Hakaforest today, when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that tonight in Hakaforest we won't see any real goal parties.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to dig a 3-2 overtime victory over Kalpa.
The rise was masculine, as last season's silver group was at its worst at the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was a lot better than that.
The Blues, who started the Raumaan harvest with a hard start, had a round zero score, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if at all playing the same game as last year, Clutch-assailant Janne Lahti predicts arrangements on the club's website.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the poor.
In fact, in the last two years, the kill has just dropped the Clave from the final series.
Both times, a decisive seventh fight has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the show to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three to the side and past.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashier who rejected both of them yesterday will receive a flute shift today.
With a hit goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: Just in progress with a lousy play
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, written by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
The defendant sensationally put a heavyweight series on the combo for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy when he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed pot shop progressed to everyone's surprise at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Matt, and a Pele Pelo Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the irokees.
Hope's a blonde.
JP Jalo, a great TV reporter, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the novelty of this season is working in the same way as it was ten years ago.
A man who works as a recent sports manager has built a pot shop on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating up guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have earned in some other game than puck.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, Pekka Rautallio plays the main role.
The Karri Stone is at risk for Sean Connery of the Iron Bowl.
In Toovola's manuscript Rocky, the Iron Tallion is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the iron bowl except a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Alley does not include running around and sipping.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ace Garret Stafford tackled Tappara's Jere Karelian head.
He got two plus ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron Tallo put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play for us are those who deserve it.
I don't approve of such a game, and it's not part of the ace puck, and after the game, Rautakallio was hot and pissed off at the people of Satakunta.
I mean, this season's team has been built strangely.
There are juniors, veterans, cops and bullies.
In practice, there are no key men in the best age of the game.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence players, Pekka Rautallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and, unfortunately, the market situation was rather limited, the Rautallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface.
In 1953, Rautakallio was known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports manager.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The current balance in the three league games of the season is equal to the score of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bass player and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but this is the first time Olga has played under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in the first year of Apulanna, you made us beautiful, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuki Cricket.
The cricket spins and supports his son, even though his father Risto (represented by Lorenzo Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me to play the part.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
Cricket has helped so much.
We've been through a lot from different angles to their history.
The Cricket also fortunately understands that drama is drama and the truth may have to be painted a little bit.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
There was a recession in the '90s, and it was really bad.
There was a pretty small chance that someone really could pull it off, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the movie plans.
But parents' stories have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Heinola's notorious skateboarder Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At best, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga says that over the past ten years, she's been working so hard with Tuukka that a big joint project doesn't scare me.
It's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in the East often plans to drive home for their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start shooting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation in progress will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa starts in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so sick, I've been so relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he's gonna tell the evening paper.
Originally, the film budget was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million could be introduced into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no loose ends.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years' time at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film shows Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
You mean like hillbilly or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The trendsediers' breasts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until a while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The promotion of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrendi, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wave.
And as often as before, the line between funny and trendy is slim: if something is a hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the Norm core trend, which is the custom fashion, where trendseters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray basic college, you put on that sweatshirt that's buried at the bottom of the closet, with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas's recognizable track sweaters, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees have also returned to street fashion.
The beginning of the jeans' edge is now a cool detail with the calvin Klein logos.
The trend seems to be moving from sports signs to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what kind of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to show me some logos while you're dressed?
A Russian politician published evidence that I didn't get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
It is claimed that an extraordinary incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, the Russian war industry product producer, was held.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims in the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to be peeking through the armored vehicle's hatch in a very good atmosphere and at least from those pictures it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the battle tank. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am an ex-soldier, Colonel. I have served at the Ural.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out in peace, and Zotov said Comosomolskaya to Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he loved the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage. I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and rosy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, it didn't happen, he said Russkaya sluzhba novotei radio.
The words of Zotov are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stowage have been published, even though a total of 50 000 people went to the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Bloknot.ru case, where Zotov was told that he was struggling to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to shoot everyone around him in the end, unless he got out of his grip.
Later, the Blocknot site published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organisers reported their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armoured vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But under no circumstances did he sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.
This is the favorite piece of interior bloggers.
The architectural brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlelight from 1962 looks like it was planned today.

There's been a leak at the Kittilä mine in Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is either pumped to be re-used as process water or passed to the environment as authorised by the surface discharge field.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaching water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the material went into the environment.
The leak was detected during a round of inspections on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structure of the pool has been observed.
The company states that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuuppäki: IMF warns against overcutting
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland towards comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole treaty system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
The IMF assessment contains a lot of pro-government messages, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be overcut.
These are investments in infrastructure, for example, Kupapäki says to the Economic Messages.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today predicts a zero growth rate in its new cyclical forecast this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest sightings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuupapäki.
It has again been possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are limited to a few per cent of decimal places.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satuu Iwata for cancer in July, starts his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata responded to the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessed by Hideki Yasuda Reuters, analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima's task is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but so that it does not eat company bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers enter Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Office, hundreds of minors are missing every year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Office of Immigration tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear "underground" per year? - In 2013, a total of 156 unaccompanied minors' asylum applications were made in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 disappeared, "says Kannelmaa.
The reason for the disappearance may be that, in the course of the proceedings, it is clear that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the examination of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 were subject to a termination decision because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the rate on the increase?
This year, by 6.9, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a single minor.
The total number of missing asylum seekers is not yet available this year, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who decide to convert?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the 'black labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Office, because the police are responsible for the implementation of translation decisions, Mr Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister for the Interior, Petteri Orpo (Kok), has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates.
He has taken action on this issue.
At the meeting of EU Ministers for the Interior, Orpo, who considered refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A., a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to seizures, for TV and radio production by Mikkose, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen is selling on Hütuto.net equipment that used to be one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online ad was the first one to tell us about the website.
Today, a large part of the equipment is at the forefront of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
But Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and people who build their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their present home in Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started. Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no use for TV and radio equipment anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkose's actual life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of boredom worse than expected: Metro and tram can stop by Friday.
Today, the drivers of the subway and tram will decide whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, we'll find out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
The cuts in the night and shift allowances are very painful for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
The deer wonders that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region will virtually be stopped.
VR reports that trains don't travel between 6: 00 a.m. and 6: 00 p.m.
There will be no local traffic or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that left before 6: 00 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses will be left at the station.
ACP members will be out of work on Friday morning and 3: 00 a.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a superior force, the HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell us exactly which bus shifts are on Friday.
The employees' organisations will hold a major demonstration at the Helsinki Rautatietori on Friday at 11-13 a.m.
Aftonblade: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in a panic.
According to the local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas. The teacher thought he had a homemade watch as a bomb.
In the United States of Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher thought of his homemade watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was showcase his electronic hobby.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked just like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said that the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
This case happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished on three days' compulsory leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether it is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain roars - Labour leader refused to sing national songs
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is an adversary of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, believed by the laboratory representative Kate Green in a radio interview with the broadcaster BBC.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial was a tribute to the British Air Force pilots' battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and emphasises his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood quietly during the national anthem with respect, the opinion stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the lab.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to appear in Parliament in the capacity of party leader during Question Time with the Prime Minister.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was a party leader on Twitter this weekend.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister referred to it in his own account.
The cause of the death of the Minnesota family was still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the death of a family in Greenwood, Minnesota for almost a week.
A five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three kids with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the Short family dead in a huge house all over the place.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire house and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, Police Commissioner of South Lake Minnetonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his assets on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short told us that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've been offered 50 buy-ins over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was seen in the fact that the Short family bought a house in Greenwood for two million dollars in 2011.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream site in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was awaiting trial.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no comments that blasphemous prepping courses had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me coffee.
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos horse owner prize for the month.
This is great. Loiri commented with a good mood on her honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the success horse gets full working rest while working with the horse.
Pekka rules and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri burped.
The stunning gesture of the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete."
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, this is the biggest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, Subban, 26 years old, is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his annual earnings of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive from the hospital a hall with his name on it.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
The long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening, serve only bikinis and apron on top of them.
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat shop, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug shop and now a wife's café.
It strikes lonely, downed and hungry.
Metro will be reporting on this.
At Ore no Yome (my Finnish wife) in Tokyo, you can order a wife or a husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be a client's wife.
The "spouse" will be selected from the list before entering the café and he will prepare and serve food.
The wife is facing just an apron and a bikini on top, the husband in tight bike shorts.
The website offers all information about the women's candidates about the length and weight of the mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: attacks on car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as described in Intel's release.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRR researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cyber security.
The company will in future update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company, Gartner, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing online data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
ASTRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and to support the view that cyber security is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been awaited for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car is also starting to be in view in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the looks of the car world are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in its press release.
Kia's favorite brand introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Car Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
More important than two new developments in Finland is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to capture a bigger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage created under the leadership of European Design Director Gregory Guillaume is more round than before.
There's a quarter of an inch between the axle and the outer dimensions, and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but it has been added to it by a 1.6 litre turbo developing 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We still have to wait for it, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimas arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the buyers of the upper middle class with improved driving features, lower noise levels and a higher level of equipment.
Optimum is obtained with 1.7 liter turbodiesel and 2.0 liter petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine arrives.
At the same time as it arrives, the sale of the Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage, flashed in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
In an electric blue panty suit, there is an impressive, open neck opening.
The costume is a beautiful introduction to the songwriter's chirowy waist.
The size of the crown is gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has lost weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer published his first single on a new record in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related stuff, the singer tells me.
In a few weeks, Chisu will publish his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astonishing again - now you see the breast
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talk one by one.
She's showing her pregnancy stomachs and her bra in sexy clothes, last night at 1: 00 in the morning, when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left her husband's Kanye West gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It will reveal the skin-coloured bra under the dress when the lightning lights flash.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity costume when he was visiting a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black upper knee boots.
The third special maternity costume is as recent as last week's Friday night, when it was a pregnancy stomach.
The rough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model, Manon Lelope, wanted to take a short look at the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Lelope and his colleagues are talking about a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six hard truths of Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the last season you were posing in top designers' costumes, the new season will begin again in Castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with connoisseurs.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their designs.
If you're very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of skinny.
Agent New York may be asking for a pound, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks run out, the difference will be bitter.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a demonstration of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
You were in the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film.
In a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band, Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band.
Apulanna was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it's a good thing that I'm just learning his playing style from a video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
The man who pilot the Scrooge Salminen and Dogs will not play the role.
Punk manners come along naturally.
The stars, the stars in the punk episode of the show, I'm sure a lot of people saw the foretaste, just as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything cute. We always go full-on.
The leading actors of Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, made us beautiful, were released today.
The core group, known to the public in the band, is presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bass player Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he told us in Snapchat that he was secretly preparing for the most important day of his career.
Mr Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Roope, seen in a mustache and a chin beard earlier, has shaved his face into a chipmunk and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think over the last few days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it at all?
We do not need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises us.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children can't always understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has collided with television news images of refugees or has heard of it elsewhere, it is worth raising the issue.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he is asking.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child follows closely the behaviour of its parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the debate, the child will feel safe.
Bigger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is best for parents to discuss this with them if it is a matter of concern to the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world have things right.
The parents, together with the children, can think about how this is going to be handled in our family.
In the end, however, do we think that the world is safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety wherever possible.
On the other hand, if you talk about difficult things in a family, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
It's hard to control the Vermo-striking Pallus.
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine the impact of Apila's Pallosalama in the middle of the summer.
It only raided victories and second place until at the end of July there was a collapse in the Tampere rave.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the observation.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the most mild, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
In Turku, it was the second SE in its record time after Taruntuvi.
Apila's Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from a break when it had been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Given those things, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that the Ori were hit by a fair competition.
The horse must have moved on from it, and hopefully it would have settled down.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called funny horses.
When you haven't had fun with it, it could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori have, on the other hand, removed such a lightning bolt that their opponents have been amazed.
At the speed of the cut, the contestants will not be able to cope with the Pallosalma, which even gives off warm-blooded rides.
The wishes of the North are a nest run in Vermo.
But the difference is how Apila's Pallosalama agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might just stick under the boom and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than Turku is about to leave.
Apila's Pallosalama can come out of the bow when she's in shape, and we're going to drive it for a win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO, Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones can be deleted in the future - but not all of it.
Apple intends to remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future, "says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Leaf Kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into this because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent from one year ago, and Eurostat, the statistical authority of the EU, announced today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called "base inflation" fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper than one year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in Malta, or by 1.4 per cent from the euro area.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still a long way from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area at an average rate of 0.1% this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1%, with the central bank anticipating in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
US Fed next tries to blackmail monetary policy
The next US recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years of the country's central bank Fed starting to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, downhill starts before the next recession.
Mr Fed has suggested that he might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession can hit us at its fastest by next autumn and as the course of the financial markets before that.
Or at least this is what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have done and react to the extortion of the Fed taps as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international large-scale customers last week.
The strategies that drew up the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics using cool facts and calculations on how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed increases.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous increases - and what might be the consequence of this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shaky state to cope with the rise in interest rates as well as once since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to start a recession.
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have been suggesting throughout the last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in over nine years can come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds key interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, a series of relatively regular but at a time small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, which led to Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years ago.
In 2007, financial market symptoms began with the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis tore to a global nightmare of doomsday.
A major downturn occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic hardship began at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the previous Fed increases.
Correspondingly, the trials were tougher and more harsh than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turmoil in financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Since the 1950s, they have been reporting on Fed's increases in interest rates and their economic and financial impact.
The start of the recession has reached its peak of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years from the start of the interest rate increases in Fed.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has alternately raised and decreased its steering rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time has deviated in some respects from the other, and the time is relatively limited, so it is hardly possible to conclude on the effects of subsequent increases.
Strategies therefore point out that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, are not necessarily determined by decades of research.
But for the reasons leading up to the crisis and increasing its destructive power, there are three things that are quite undeniably clear:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble while growing the next one.
(2) The accumulated and already excessive debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy has increased even further as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history since then was created.
(3) In particular, the low-cost debt financing, which was almost halted in the financial economy, inflated to most aspects of the financial markets the biggest price bubbles in the history of the economy so far from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Again, there is hardly any serious dispute that the financial markets, which have risen above ever more complex debt levers, were in an extremely dangerous and unstable situation when Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures on the levers, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last as long as the interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche strategies do not know what will happen next, but give cause for thought by mentioning, for example, the following aspects:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago; now, at its cheapest, debt is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt ratio of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now there is a much heavier debt burden in the various parts of the economy than before or ever before the financial crisis.
(3) The liquidity outflows from central banks have largely remained on the financial markets and have left the main types of securities and assets at their most expensive, whether at the peak or at any time before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategies strike the scene with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its money taps.
Perhaps the future image of Albert Edwards, the strategy of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as the sudden appearance can be.
For a while now, he has been coaching the Bank's international investor customers for Fed's following translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to run off the financial fires with even bigger QE injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed towards HP's business service side, the company says.
In November HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer pc machines and printers.
HP had a maximum number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced from 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reduction on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65% of the operating result was imported by its three most significant customers.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after the iPhone Apple update release
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If the update is complete, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when a "Software update failed" error report appears on the screen.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic traffic to pass or try to upgrade through the iTunes programme.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications to obtain space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes applications to be deleted and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not end.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery runs out, it may result in the update being breached.

It is also worth making sure that you have gone through our list of all the things that need to be done before downloading so that things do not go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they do. iOS 9 brings with it new features such as a much smarter personal assistant and a huge number of new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and correct the operating system.
Upper: Minister Berner has been active on the board of the tax havens company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications (Central), has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company, Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still formally a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, "says Berner in the interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The ownership of Kährs, a Swedish company, is managed through a Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Government of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and, after the merger, of the Government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner tells the General that he received government membership at the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked to have a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and the starting point is secured in this context, "says Berner.
Berner tells General that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the capital fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens the reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo opens the first reception centre operated by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today, starting at 6 p.m.
Within a week, the number of places can increase to between 300 and 400 persons.
The Office of Immigration will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Academy.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, which is specifically concerned with the provision of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agreed, among other things, on the Centre's security arrangements.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmail.
The association also wants other employees' organisations to be involved.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be restored.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, and Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organisation's administration.
However, Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EK) does not have the capacity to discuss.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change security provided by the Government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, compared to EUR 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party is terribly keen to have a conversation if you have a one-to-one ratio of 100.
Palola: Constructive connection
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) has wished for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to present a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Mr Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, the cuts to the STTK field, especially the Sunday allowances, are a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would be implementing part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, Palola does not warm up to preparing an alternative package with the SDP involved.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work-related blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, salaries for the first sick days are cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their views and that the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
Mr Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STTK on its announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, since Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lüly will come along to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Mr PALOLAN STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is prepared to negotiate the 5% competitiveness jump that the government is seeking as an alternative to cuts.
The week has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of change and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same coal..." playing bingo when Sipilä speaks tonight.
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left at Tampere University tonight.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made special speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the last speech of the Prime Minister, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he made the famous radio speech which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers held several radios during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen put an end to the train operators' strike on television.
It's monologue, monarchist stuff.
The chipmunk's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said that "Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a monologue has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Doors of the SDP condemned "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them."
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon, six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
I've tried.
What is it you're afraid of?
Public service
According to the Council of State's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, and the CEO of the EK, Jyri Häkäman.
The general has been criticised for presenting the Sipilä speech.
We considered the matter and said that it was a public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line on the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like we were in the Oak Age ♪
The speech has also aroused ridicule.
When the evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be scrubbed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on a prettier piece of junk and my dad puts a tie on her neck.
At 9: 00 p.m., we will be silenced to the TV like I used to be when we were in the Oaks, "says the blogger Saku Timone.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why the Finnish Government sits in the tax havens with millions of people who hide their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the money is out of the state?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
It's published the bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the debts of living and the team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan whereby, after some time, al-Assad would have left power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be contacted immediately, and the renunciation of al-Assad had to be carried out calmly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we will be able to have an open debate.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, and Ahtisaari will remember in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats don't comment.
The Ahtisaari says that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr Shurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements by which he would remain in power.
The former leader of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Middle East, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari has said, because in his experience Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power to some Al-Assad supporter.
The influx of refugees for our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, around 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves created, the Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The organisation centre for asylum seekers pushed to Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio joint lyseo, which is empty in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the Council would have already decided to present the school building as a state solution to the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Tuupkinen (left), that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would point out to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the conference.
13 delegates were opposed to the Centre.
On that basis, you could expect a positive decision, "says Tuuppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and a rapid response was received.
It is estimated that 500 asylum seekers would be able to join together at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, "says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), half of the holiday money in public would only cover part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the government.
However, he said that the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners managed to agree on this.
Ms Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that she had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be an effective means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut-off of Sunday allowances.
The social partners could agree between themselves on the reduction of holiday allowances, as they are recorded in collective agreements rather than in law.
With this view, next Wednesday, the government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a communication from the Council of State.
Mr Sipilä said that the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then take off, i.e. the train will be on the move and will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen, if there's any will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published last week by the government includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and the Thursday of hela into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the first days of sickness are reduced, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these efforts, the employees' organisations are holding a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have also declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the sahlahalli warehouse
The board of directors of Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, the mahlahalli.
The criticism was made by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than what was originally talked about.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that it would cost an estimated EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the local area.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
The Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous steep position to bring street signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of preserving the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not proclaim to be the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu is more part of the Eastern Savolish dialects.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs in the centre of the city.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth taking an open-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still specific to the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both can well be used for the various marketing activities of the province.
Decommissioning of trains cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the county's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the regional economy and competitiveness.
And that affects whether we can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points to air transport, which has also been the subject of a number of reports.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not succeed in reducing the possibilities of state intervention, as is now happening.
We should look at the effects of these cuts in transport connections, for example on employment, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration in accessibility poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor accessibility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because of the lack of cross-border access.
About one-half of students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for the war of you
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the provincial Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is also one among the gravel voices.
Mr Pentti Keskisalo, Member of the City Board (sd., in the picture), presented at the government meeting on Monday that the whole project should be abandoned, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit less than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train shifts is left out, but still five times a day from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
These reductions are the result of savings by the State.
The purchase of train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The Rescue Department let a 12-year-old climb off the roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at 6: 30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder at all on the roof.
It didn't stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur tower next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
The result was that the others slipped away from the scene and the passers alerted the rescue services to help the last one left safely on the roof to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit is double, decreasing the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its profit forecast throughout the year, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it was going to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects the tax year to end next May at 10.40-10.90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts were waiting for $10.84, told in the FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges for the land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it expected the operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, the turnover has increased and the online trade is growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "is performing in a stable manner, taking into account less favourable economic conditions than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade."
The plans for remuneration during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS told us that he was going to employ between 90 and 95 000 extra workers, about the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which is from the average estimate of $2.44. The 12 analysts' survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
In Zack's poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of the turnover of its Express unit.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the activities were basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately an hour before the opening bell, FedEx's shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
The decision-makers of the US Central Bank are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time in almost a decade.
On the other side of the central bank's decorative two-storey conference room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
Congress has placed two responsibilities on the Central Bank's shoulders: they must maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, that the decision whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off by the record incentive that has been brought about by the short-term interest rate that has remained almost zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the central bank officials who are already on their guard even more startled as regards increasing instability, and there is a fear of what would be the impact if the federal funds rate were to be raised by even a percentage point in a quarter.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," explains Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Financial Expert for Stifel Nicolaus & Co, the broker.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid reason to wait yet," he says.
There is no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which also gives rise to economic turmoil.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, around half of the financial experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This indicates a decline in securities markets if the central bank raises the level if the decision-makers fail to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not take place soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, "says John Lonski, the chief financial expert for Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they will have to make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would reassure the financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the Central Bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the threshold for full employment.
The rise in wages has shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers consider that the main reason for this is the temporary effect of the price of significantly reduced oil.
The economy "survives and also needs higher interest rates in view of the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, chief financial expert for Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16% from its May record, as investors feared that China's slowing down economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that explains when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks' news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, specialist investigator at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still rather unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China."
The well-being of the international economy is not the central concern of the Central Bank and should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the insinuations of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the Central Bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused revolutions in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, stated this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be distinct from the fundamentals of the economy '.
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for interest to be raised, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, "despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a period of major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, "says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England 's Committee on Interest Rates.
The last turmoil is nowhere near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to see an increase in interest rates that is feared because the market is getting upset," says Mr Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Children's Disease Organization in Rio Grandessa promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children's Disease Organization SPRS has found a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been photographed as unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that an increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven channel Sunrise is a favorite audience, despite the N channel's attempts to news the director's revelation on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to announce the afternoons of the liberal party leader revelation failed to increase the number of viewers in Today.
The Nine Channel breakfast program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull overpowered Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, dating from David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of that week's international broadcast series, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance load did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV viewers, as the average audience for Sunrise in five Länder was 397 000, compared with 339 000 for Today.
The average of Today rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318 000 and for Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, in September, the average for Sunrise is 349 000 viewers, compared with 314 000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you!
Published on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 words series, with the former Star Erik Thomson of the Packed to the Rafters series, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have been wondering if Thomson has the most popular series as a portable force alone without Raffters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
Seven channel The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning the Block Series (838 000) and the TBL Families Series (726 000).
Seven Channel had a double destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new quiz program gathered 446.000 spectators.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat programme (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour viewer in The Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 spectators, while the second half-hour had a huge 720 000.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The fall in the second-night viewer average of The Chase Australia will give the Nine Channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on the McGuire programme.

The final three agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who is he choosing?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won the Bachelor series.
The woman's identity has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls certainly won't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they may have inadvertently tipped off the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women threw themselves into poetry when they told them how Wood was the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positivity as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
But when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?" their answers may have provided an indication of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay's relationship with Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house (Sarah), energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very close to earth. It's fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be having fun and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with all my heart in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7: 30 on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his move to the United States and many other teams have asked him about his influence since his open day of practice at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby turn dropped the ball in its first kick-back when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next kick and brought him into the race after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the locker room after the game.
Instead of calling his new newcomers a pot shark in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised her to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and her many Australian fans wished for a man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the field after the fall, and later she told the Australian radio band Hamish & Andy to the 2DayFM channel on 104.1 that she couldn't have imagined a worse start in her NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his acidification with his 2007 Origin debut, when feeding in his own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Kodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukus was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed by police shooting rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after a police shooting of rubber bullets in a crowd that spoke out against the country's new draft Constitution, said the authority on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the highest official in the region, said that more than 1000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to cause so many deaths.
The summary was the last violent demonstrations over the last few weeks across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent conflicts, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the clauses in the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Centre of the United States, the NHC, says that there is a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde.
On the broad low-pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde archipelago, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, according to the US National Hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
The second low-pressure front, which is located in the middle of the Cape Verde archipelago and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google starts a donation campaign with the aim of collecting $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees in Europe as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of reporting to the Director, from his personal experience, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and dark," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But with the growing refugee and immigration crisis in Europe, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations will be made by four non-profit organisations that will help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it will match every donation made worldwide on the Google.com / refugeerenelief website up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war rampage from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help slightly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of diet surgery in patients with mild obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these slightly obese diabetics will live longer after a weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight surgery expert who wrote an editorial paper on a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
For weight reduction surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study were morbid obese and had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight ratio to height, is considered to be normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the BMI is more than 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers in the Taiwanese hospital Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, medication for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The study showed that the mean BMI of the patients undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained approximately the same at 29 for those who were treated by means other than surgery.
Thirty-six per cent and 28 per cent of the patients in the surgery showed complete and partial improvement in diabetes.
In comparison, in the treatment group, only 1% and partly about 2% improved diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-cholesterol were generally better in the surgery group, "said the authors.
Researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin A1c levels which reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, with researchers writing.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c dropped from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, it remained stable at approximately 8% in the treatment group.
However, this improved "glycaemic control ', as described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, explains the chief investigator, Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass graft had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased its body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased its haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese patients undergoing weight reduction surgery had a 29% lower probability of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with less than 35 BMI who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for a group of lower body mass index," and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient has BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that there is a real solution to the current refugee crisis in the Middle East.
The head of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Complsion in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain, which is dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that although the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of many thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, "he added.
In adopting a position on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused violent events in the chain.
"After 9 / 11-The attack, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Over the last four years, the ingestion of hand disinfectant in children has increased four-fold
Poison data centres across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400% in the ingestion of strongly alcoholic hand disinfectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, says the Georgian poison information centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian poison information centre, cases of ingestion of disinfectant reported to the poison information centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant deliberately, while others want to impress their friends or meet the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get cheap drinking.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrance of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handkerchiefs) are those with a fragrance added.
There are disinfectants with the odour of strawberry, grapes and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
Especially in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of the intoxication centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave whiskey shots lying on the table, but hand disinfectant is left out, and if the kids are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four syringes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, twice as high as the adult drinking limit, says First Aid Clinic Chris Ritchey, who was treating a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah stormed when he spoke and couldn't walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of possible brain injury, because the alcohol caused the girl to fall down and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," Nhajah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and remove disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontarian women died after swallowing hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial venom into the classroom, reported in a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from her class.
The police consider the preventive plan to be a "nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffith disagrees with Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is alert to January recruits that can interfere with team unity.
Dons raised his lead in Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time shootout led Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton to Pittoria Stadium and gave the team a chance to increase the gap with Celtic to five points.
Griffith belittles the contradictions.
There have been rumours about the internal conflicts within Celtic, but Griffith immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under closer observation when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship is boring the Dutch - de Boer
The former rangers midfield player and the former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with rangers.
Mr de Boer, current Ambassador of Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands, the highlights of Celtic games are no longer shown and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't with us.
People around here are tired of talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Company teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tension in these teams' games, and other than the Scots want to follow those games.
Deila swears she's gonna turn this thing around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League resulted quickly in the loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with the difference of five points to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is on his guard for the January player moves.
Although Ranger boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for the January transfers, he is alert to the recruitment best, ensuring that he does not want to confuse the consensus of the group.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment time is the time before the whole season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu insinuates retirement
Swansea's assailant, Michu, whose name is attached to the transport window in connection with Celtic, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans has ended.
A 29-year-old player has been having ankle problems for two years and has not been able to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost after this 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card that Colum condemned, which was revoked in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by what he says, saying, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffith swears he will avoid Tynecast.
The loyal Hibernian player was rebuked by the granting of an insulting song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a momentary impulse," said the attacker, adding: "It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I go to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together, "Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy for "ugly win" in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick, managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that would not have won games in this way."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's total increase
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164 000 persons between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to the figures of the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over the past 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify of execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention at all, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit in the audience's gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glaulip be executed by lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to abhor this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists will, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than available places, participants will be selected through a terrible lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever they choose will look at the event as cool as possible.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glaunop's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection with him through months of phone calls and one two and a half hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter that I had compromised my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, so you can be part of it.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "he could have handled his words better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glaulip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I won't do it even if he says so.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glamep dies, he believes that publicity will help the opposition to the death penalty.
The reporter from Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast I've done for you.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glaulip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective from which I watch him die.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists here who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
He was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police officer.
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured a man out of the Canning River.
The attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just feet away from a policeman who tried to "gently lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying," I'm not coming out, come get me, "said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "proper police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The champion football player Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned their car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start planning a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the agents tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that the agents of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate his stables last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
He blames the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department for claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what's best for competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue down about spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes all you have to do is react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk my head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start to think differently, I don't have to be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, I'll name him when I ask him, and offer him a job in my stables if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, then they'd better fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear about it at that time and are clear about it today.
Am I supposed to start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps to pass on responsibility to non-trainers for what is happening in this area?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I that bad for the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they will have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that that is what I am saying today might make them think.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has grown with the long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and late rejection has made him realise that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the day-to-day management rule "ridiculous" after the mud or clay bath has been placed on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the day-to-day incubation, on which the suppliers started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver in a hit-and-run in Cobram.
The police have arrested a man who ran off after he ran into a cyclist this weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the police in Sheppard himself.
He will be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobrami, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team is attacking competitors in wrestling disputes.
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm has criticised the arguments of the two NRL rugbyliga champions that his team's tactics are part of "alignment."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his side when it suddenly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the finals. Bennett called the game rugby iga "window" and said that the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" by wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tactics and said they were just focusing on "contact" when they tackled.
Bellamy added that his trust was enhanced by two leading coaches' criticism of Storm, because that means they're afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not exchanged anything in our defence systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks we have only stressed the importance of contact in the tacks, and that has made us successful.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coach St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boring."
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare Saturday night's game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St. George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have those types of players.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as the answer to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more picky than the one between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does breaking an exciting line of defense and not scoring?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, that means somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronella Sharks at AAMI Park next Saturday night's premiere. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Serb man's $200,000 bail on a drug charge.
A man who is threatened with a life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released against a bail of $200,000.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drug to the Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at Coomera Road House, where the police found 40 kilos of drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic threatens a possible life sentence for attempted possession of the amount of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the entire amount and that he could have been in the café for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together had offered $200,000 bail to ensure his release.
"Having read the testimony of both parties, it is clear that setting a bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrendered his passport to both Australia and Serbia, registered daily to the police and maintained his curfew between 6: 00 and 6: 00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then checked in to the online communication service where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She checked her phone and found some shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
When the police came to see five images, they looked at the computers on the scene and found "worrying" web searches with search terms used to search for unscrupulous images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to attract paedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretended to be a cop to scare them."
The Fiscal Depute representative, Eilidh Robertson, told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the searches on the computer but said that they were only made because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and when Hogg asked him to send him more pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that when he drank, he was sick of his head, and he wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When she found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shook and cried.
My mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger than her.
On 14 June last year, the 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt at the charge of manufacturing or taking pictures of unscrupulous children, violated his bail on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March of this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not be entered in the register of sex offenders, since it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element '.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to give the social services time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the record of sex offenders before the date of the conviction.
Mr Mugabe made the wrong speech to Parliament in Zimbabwe
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall spread like a virus in social media.
The opening of this House was also tainted by the allegations made by the opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous death threats, warning them not to book Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booked him and interrupted him with an interlude when he gave a speech on the state of the country to Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group leader Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is" death, "" Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity would end in Parliament and, when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group leader said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is' concerned 'about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts bring costs of around USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP Bulletin.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President of HP and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over $50 billion, and it "focuses on producing unparalleled, integrated technology solutions" for companies, is described in the company's release.
In the 1930s, the division dismantles a company that was founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard from Stanford University to make electrical supplies.
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, and its distribution is the latest in a sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Artega says teammates have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb draw.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, at least four of the next English games will be missed by Wilshire, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return through the middle, there is always a risk of further injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debut six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons he has played Arsenal for 157 league games only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's larger set after the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Valioliga teams that has lost most days due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in disability statistics over the last period will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury, it can be a vulnerable period when you have to strengthen your body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the kind of career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artella are likely to be in the process.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give a breather to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear preference for F-section, the maximum stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
In addition, Dinamo has not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own 'Undefeated' campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons of the last season of the Champions League's surrender against Monaco and is motivated by an ever-distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in series, especially given that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK and is three times more common in men than in women.
The company tackled the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for a man's year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevented men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included over 2,000 upper-secondary and upper secondary school students showing symptoms of depression. The study showed that the possibility of a person recovering doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his or her friends were "in a healthy mind."
Similarly, those who were not depressed were less likely to experience possible mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media through communication time style goes past content and the immediate response is often more important than relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation rules.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status, all at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of internal longing - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The beauty of the Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No figure was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me:... "listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends are one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide longer-term survival options.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you attend Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee?
Or better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You'll never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent from the start to the end of Comedy Central, all 236 episodes, participating in # FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside.
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinburgh Cavan are celebrating goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored the Champions League in his debut, helping PSG to bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is a match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 victory against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut for less than four minutes, showing the way to the French Champions, but the team lost a number of possibilities before eventually increasing its lead when Cavan hit the target by 61 minutes.
Paris, in the same block A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because there was not only an extension but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarterly finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG scored, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost the place in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and that team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"The Champions League is not easy to win at home or in guests, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and there is a good start, although there are things that we will have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is good news.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after the injury in one of the three changes made after the team was left in the 2-2 tie game Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran into Marco Verratt's feed behind Malmö's line of defense and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
However, if someone was expecting PSG to make an easy and big profit, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. He won Celtic in the game when he reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team offered little on the offensive side except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot at 34th minute, which was barely past Kevin Trapp's goal pole.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble because of the missed inputs and poor finalisation, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in five companies in the first half of the year alone, and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the ball at the very beginning of the second half of Ibrahimovic's touch.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was precisely at the injection of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria sent a spin-off which was tilted around the Wiland pole at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally achieved one hour after the game, thanks to Cavan, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had flicked Maxwell's cross feed from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight against David Luiz's direct kick kept the rest of the numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi, which came out of the exchange, was rejected right at the end of the game.
Malmo's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last game of the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
It's not enough to fight for a race.
I'm going to take my hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
The mine division in Switzerland was left by Glencore, which suffered from the collapse of commodity prices, collected USD 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its comprehensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in the notification that it had sold some GBP 1.6 billion of new shares in order to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is a burden on demand and a cause of destruction in all markets.
The new label raised the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange at Wednesday's Ages.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a rate of 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had unveiled a $2.5 billion share deal in the previous week as part of its wider plan to cut its debt burden of $30 billion by around one third.
The company sold the new share capital for 125 pence, which was a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, totalling 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the prolonged stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
China's President, Xi Jinping, makes a visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and will respond to President Obama's visit to Beijing last November, which said.
The President of the United States and the President's spouse, Michelle Obama, will arrange a dinner for X and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Predent Xi provides an opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President Xi to engage constructively in discussions on issues of disagreement."
With the visit, which was first announced in February, X is also expected to depart from Seattle on its trip to Washington to meet a number of US technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged online espionage and the increased country's absolute presence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon underscores the difference in filmmaking.
Matt Damon brought together an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, when they discussed a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
In the HBO Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown by highlighting the need for different perspectives as regards the black person in the selected script for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a show," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted to the injured unconfidently, commenting on "Wow! Wow." Okay, while the comments of the Martian actor were hanging in the air.
The other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I would like to urge people to think, whoever the director is, about how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore that his white pimp hits.
The Dead White People producer insisted on the rights of film guidance for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied abruptly that their guidance "could end up giving us something we do not want."
When the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
The Twitter user, Mr Pooni, expressed his anger at the film clippings by writing: "Matt Damon speaking on top of the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is that they hurt."
After its publication, tweeting collected more than 5000 rewinders and 4000 pleasures.
Damon's comments come at a time when the exact racial presentation of the media is at the forefront of social debate.
Following the killing of a teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, Prince, the singer, referred to the movement when he presented the Album of the Year candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently issued a statement to respond to the question by Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media mogul invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
The professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became on Monday the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a million-dollar prize.
The competition programme that has just ended its seventh period has never had a competitor who has survived all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last mission was to climb a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and clarified the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to discover the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News after a hard victory and was still in shock about winning the $1 million prize.
"I mean, it's great to think about this when I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! After his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finale with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten does not receive more reward money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great prize and changes life, he gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose shoot starts in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers crept past Minnesota Twins.
The other half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but he's now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role as a spoiler perfectly on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get up half a mile from Houston Astros in the race for another American League Wild Card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
"All profits are fun, no matter how you get them," said the Tigers' team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers' pitcher, Alfredo Simon, continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1 / 3 in turn and allowed three runs.
This was just his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for an alternative to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' surrogate Victor Martinez hit three times and made it possible to run two runs that had been his first run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in the batting exercises), looked much better in the batting exercises and continued with the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Senator Byron Buxton started a shift partner by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, came home with one pin, and Simon was able to burn Brian Dozier, the second baseball player, before Simon was replaced with Blaine Hardy, left-handed.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against him, the first-born surrogate, Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-nest run left of Drew VerHagen, right-handed.
With two runners on the field and a levelling runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal that would lead to a double game.
It was the record of the main series: the 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a confirmation run at the beginning of the ninth, Mauer pulled two battered runs against the Tigers' shutter, Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
The right-handed player, however, burned I say in three assists in his fifth rescue.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured people before the game after being away for more than a month due to an infection in the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game went on, I felt more comfortable, and I felt I was able to make a few nice passes on the third pair of shifts."
After Hughes picked up the starting batter for the first nest, he let the second baseball player Ian Kinsler move along.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting, who took himself on a midfield hit to first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good running position.
The third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to proceed to third base.
The Tigers continued on the second pair and received one fire, two nests in the situation of the runner James McCann and two nests in the case of one nest in the case of the running center Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," said Paul Molitor, team leader of Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be on the feed and fed a treadless third pair of shifts, after which he was replaced by a right-handed follower A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs out of six shots and a walk in four fires.
ATTENTION: Tiger's right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was removed from the shoulder of the throwing hand due to a sprain.
He's being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August because of the shoulder sprain, but he had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will be on the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris's statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four beginnings after the left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th, due to the sprain of the right crooked stomach muscle.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will stand against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA), the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota.
Xi calls for economic opening up to the wider world
The economy must be more open to the outside world in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, whose task is to steer the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign finance and expertise and to developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading up to the deepening of generalism.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being driven forward with more new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take on private capital and a review of the registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed is created.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, as stated in the opinion.
The government also loosens its control over the power that it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to conduct their business.
The opinion also said that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors will be opened up in order to open up sectors dominated by the State to private donors.
"The government will not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the search process for permanent residence permits, "green cards," for foreigners will be facilitated by optimising requirements and simplifying the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a statement published after the meeting.
