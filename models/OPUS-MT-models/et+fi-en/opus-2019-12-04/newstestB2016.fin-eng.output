We found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The announcement of the disappearance of a boy who left Western Tampere with his friend has spread through social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and has no life or health risk.
The boy's father told evening-saying that he knew he'd been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the afternoons.
The boy was found near home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, wild again, ripped the paint off of the Messis.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing also in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo about the goal of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the latter's advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time scorer statistics when he fired two hits on the visitor Shahtar Donetski's network of punishments and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his march to 80 when the Barcelona Messages, which had been tied up with him before Tuesday, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0 game.
Juventus has been stumbling in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the D-section of the Champions' League it started with a strong 2-1 victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored in good ten minutes before the end of Juventus's Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had no kneecaps.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's election league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
The second company of Manchester, United, also experienced great hardship in Holland against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old defenseman of the ManU, was only 15 minutes away from the game.
The dangerous-looking sliding tackle of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with the ManU package so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 wire by 41 minutes, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno paved before the break in extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Goalline period began the A-section of Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the Argentinian Angel Di Maria who had changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and put the ball in the back corner past Malmo's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinburgh Cavani made a second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG's been betting on the season's success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
For the first time, PSG's star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met his professional career starting company Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost in the B-section in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president gave the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had made a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has made the same speech in the country's Parliament again at the end of last month.
Mr Mugabe apparently did not realise during his 25-minute speech that the speech was the same.
The speech aroused doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was full of spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe's staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech addressed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders for next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe's future registered more effectively.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of Ministers of the Interior.
The professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
The university professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call to his home with a little trembling police officer and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their dear dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a message written in white paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the letter that Lamb signed said to the authorities.
There was no evidence in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometres to the campus of the school. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was considered dead at the door of his office, who was believed to have been shot by Lambi.
Police Chief Lynn Buford, Delta State University, stated that the university officials were informed about the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call a while after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
On the day following the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind carefully locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out what Lamb's motive was.
Researchers looked at the details in both locations, and those who knew Lambi told us about the man, who created a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to Professor's classes.
According to Gautier police at the scene of Prentiss' death, the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lambi in a book where he had given recognition to the "wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to spend his academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which included 17 staff. Many of the students attended both men's courses.
However, there were indications of problems.
The student Brandon Beavers, who praised Lambi, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's recruitment policy meant that the thesis for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professor.
University headmaster William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lambi and Schmidt, but said that Lambi was clearly troubled by something.
These are the questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police could reach Lambi, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, and the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson told us.
Lambi's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told me that he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a teacher in geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
He got a PhD in education this spring.
One of Lambi's longstanding friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lambi through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were on him, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson in Brandon.
It seems that Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no document says they haven't been married.
A couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the river estuary in the little town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss Shawn O'Steen told me that he broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago, that the couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was completely shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they called together sometimes.
O'Steen said his daughter composed and played her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator at a modest restaurant called The Julep Room outside Gautier, said he saw Lambi and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and a harmonica for a few people.
There was nothing to deny that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
Both had a good sense of humor. "
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell in English.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied Emporia at the State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own fraternity and fraternity.
There are 900 people on the Delta State University campus in Cleveland who gathered for a memorial in the candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night-time event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day. "
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also made clear that even though Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in an emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to employ as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is offering his current employees and seasonal workers additional hours of work.
The company plans to employ 40 000 people in shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014 it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months to go on holiday, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary labour for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The next night was also of personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royalty to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It appeared to me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox said in the trailer of the coming Back in Time documentary.
"When the movie started, I realized the situation looked like a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is linked to Back to the Future, and in addition to Fox, it interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemecki and producer Steven Spielberg.
The Return to the Future film was premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD format and will be displayed in selected cinemas from October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military efforts and stated that there was no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Ban announced his intention to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, and this meeting would take place in the context of the ministerial week of the UN General Assembly later this month.
Mr Ban regretted the fact that the dispersion of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has led to a situation that cannot be resolved.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity as those that achieved the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Eight chapters of the poll: Is Donald Trump serious?
They've tried to label Trump as an empty talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some of us are predicting a collapse for Trump.
The Republican circles (so far) have made every effort to pull Trump down from the polls.
Ten of the 11 national polls show Donald Trump two-digit support figures. Some are already seriously considering what it actually says about the possibilities of nominations for a real estate mogul.
However, the elections are only at an early stage.
There has not yet been any announcement that Trump will be elected as a Republican candidate.
The experts point out that at this time, Rick Perry, who was at the polls in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain.
Trump would be difficult for a general election for many reasons.
External groupings such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and started digging their image to bring him down.
The following recent polls show that real estate mogul cannot be ignored by a self-abstraction:
There's been a full translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, according to the University of Monmouth polls, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive picture.
At the beginning of August the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures will also be maintained in the Länder where the elections will take place first.
Last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump in the Quinnipiac polls.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In the CNN and ORC polls last week, 67% of Republicans stated that they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson has almost as keen a reception as Trump (43% would be very pleased with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a 21% share of support.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected party candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his grandeur and insulting comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of a real estate mogul suitable for the president. The views are reflected in ABC News and Washington Post's opinion polls.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting will take place first: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities suitable for the commander-in-chief of the military.
However, according to ABC and Post, 44% consider that Trump is not able to function effectively and six out of ten consider Trump's temperature inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to it.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected party candidate, according to the CNN and ORC polls, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Size: The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump will beat up almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that a split camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of different candidates.
The Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would get a larger number of support almost always.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take over Trump by 19 points in a fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken the vote.
According to the polls published on Tuesday by CBS and WB, a fair half of Trump's supporters are convinced of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his or her mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's greatest competitor at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
After Donald Trump's campaign speech, two months ago, immigrants from Mexico were raped by immigration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches drive out important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and hamper the renewal of the brand.
According to the opinion polls of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, however, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes. The fact that both have been nominated as outsiders significantly increases popularity.
According to the latest opinion polls of ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to a poll commissioned by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republican activities in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the verge of rage. "
Jeremy Corby debuted the Prime Minister at Question Time.
After the elections, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The Labour Party Labour's new front shot, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time to reflect on his powers at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions a little after noon. The media and Labour representatives will follow the man with a hard eye.
Corby's been calling for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said that he can skip some of the sittings and leave them to his colleagues.
For the first time, Corby's leadership will be weighed in connection, and Corby will now be subjected to a parliamentary test following the gathering of the shadow government and his speech at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions in Corbyn on Tuesday.
During the National Song, the Labour Party's decision to remain silent during the 75th anniversary celebrations of the Great Britain Air War has been criticised by several representatives of the Tory Party. The silence has also ended up in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
The representative of Corbyn stated that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, in silence respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle against Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn shadow government, said in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the party leader to join the National Song despite the opposition to this monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, invoking differences in economic, defence and foreign matters. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
Robin Brant, the BBC policy correspondent, considers that political disagreements about British EU membership and the conditions under which the government would grant benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn told us that Labour was going to propose amendments to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position was very clear: it is only against the government's plans to lower the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet in the last decade under the leadership of Tory.
The Labour Director who promised a new approach to politics says that he has chosen to ask Cameron questions about the 30 000 proposals he received from the public.
According to Mr Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, there are too many clashes during Question Time, who promised to avoid witty words and licensing and said that he would instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that the shadow minister Angela Eagle is covering for him during Question Time, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also thrown the idea into the air that others, too, could sometimes get out loud, and he says that he has discussed this with the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
After Corbyn took over the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-theatrical policy, which is often linked to Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the director's judgment, management and status, but according to the critics, Question Time has become a caricature which needs major reforms.
"Shot in Jobburg": from homeless to young people for photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.

"I was shot in Jobburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has graduated from the project among the first.

The pound grows stronger as British wages rise
The pound was strengthened as wages rose in Great Britain, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared with the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not included.
The faster growth than expected was the fastest since 2009.
The pound increased by 1 per cent and its price was quoted to USD 1,5505. The pound also increased in proportion to the euro and was quoted to EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which dropped by 20% when the company received the initial bid from AB Inbev.
If it were to happen, it would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under the same roof.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive result of the competing Ricemont group focusing on luxury products.
The latest sales figures for Richemont are better than forecast. The trend in sales was also rising in the key market for Burberry in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5% after the mining giant announced its intention to raise a share offering of USD 2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's shares in the packaging and paper group were the biggest fall with a 4.3% drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
The JD Sports rate increased by 3.1 per cent following the announcement by the sports company that its pre-tax return would increase by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Steering Group, raising the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports's enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against Aldi's slimming.
MetCash aims to secure its IGA shop from the invasion of Aldi in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against an invasion of Aldin's 700 million Australian dollars.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands through marketing in mainstream media and social media and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory in Dunsborough offers flavours at IGA shops, and traders sell tickets to the football league in South Australia at discount prices.
MetCash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade wholesale will organise the annual investment strategy date.
This is a major market, since South and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the coverage is higher than the IGA store network in the eastern Länder.
South and West Australian consumers are well known for their corner nature, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30% and West Australia has a market share of 24%, while the eastern Länder have only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimates that the sale of IGA traders could come to the sale of 360 million dollars and Metcash to the sale of $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and reach a sale of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
MetCash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million in the result before interest and taxes, says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Coles, although according to Roy Morgan's recent study, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and its market share would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, announced at a meeting in Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public view of Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash government contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen since 2010 from 18% to 14%, and the result of Metcash's food business, which serves 1200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% compared to 2012.
However, the wholesale trader will take counter-measures and make an annual deposit of more than 150 million Australian dollars to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworth for hundreds of products on a weekly basis. The chain wants to support traders in the modernisation of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food supply of their own brands.
According to Ian Morrice, President and CEO of MetCash, price adjustment and store reform plans are well on track and the company will be able to increase its profits for the first time in 2017 for four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis league, is defending Thanasi from Cook.
Mr Kokkinakis deserves special mention of his behaviour rather than criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis league, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios incident. Cookkinakis deserves special mention instead of criticism.
The younger side of the two named "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavourable spotlight when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in the competition between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge was forced to separate his competitors twice. "Wawrinka should have kicked the shit out of Cyrgiosis and my friend," said Harrison.
In the open in the United States, Kokkinakis struck the bat with frustration when the powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting against the United Kingdom in the semifinals of the Davis Cup behind Bernard Tomic in second place of single play.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been dragged into his dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the game in the open in the United States. He is not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he did.
However, he has been very successful in the provocative behaviour of Harrison, for example, in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unjust.
He is very mature for 19 years of age, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He practices hard, is in good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own merites. "
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important round starting in the recesses. Healy describes the solution for a joint decision that works for all parties. However, she supports the return of Canberra's educator to the long-term strengthening of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the fights instead of the arguments relating to Cyrgios," said Healy.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Mr Federer and Mr Murray have pointed out, the young man is going to grow up in the spotlight of the public. He deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we will try to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We will also try to arrange for his own peace. I believe that is best for both the team and Nick. "
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrest migrants
Hungary, which declared the emergency, closed its southern border from the Serbian direction on Tuesday and caught illegal immigrants, with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in no-man's land, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People fleeing violence had to remain in their tents on the road between inspection posts in the countries for an indeterminate period of time.
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
When the police helicopter flew in the air above the immigrants, they said, "Open the border!" and cried out insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them became a protest against eating and drinking.
The Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that it did not accept that migrants should be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in Brussels in the next few days and also in other countries. "
The border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed in their attempts to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40 000 influx of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with the hope that agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not express its hope for immediate action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed in such a way that the authorities in the two southern regions were able to introduce more effective means of closing down roads and speeding up the legal process in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border in order to prevent the influx of migrants from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already in place.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for barbed wire work between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottlenecks and a transit point for migrants in the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people arriving are refugees from the standard of living, not war refugees who are entitled to seek protection, and that this is very different from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage the four-metre-high barbed wire fence that the government has built on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and to set longer periods of imprisonment for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation of mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis," Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, told journalists in Szeged's town in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept the military measures that are expected next week, and the journalists from the Associated Press News Office at the border have for several days seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Mr Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's Internal Security Advisor, said that the authorities have caught those who tried to cross 45 borders immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By damaging the fence, the people who crossed the border are now in the hands of the police, charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday. One border crossing point was closed by means of a railway wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container at a point where people packed in.
About 20 of them were able to fit in, but thousands were left out.
The second group of migrants blocked the main street linking Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were in a food and drink shed until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership over Bernie Sanders decreased by half according to the national polls
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton still has two figures in the race for the national presidential candidate of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached the end of the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the democrats (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure for the presidential race, with 15% support among democrats.
More than five months before the pre-election elections, it is too early to tell the majority of democrats who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more certain of their choice than those of other candidates.
Since the polls commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost its support for a number of democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly, and he only has a 5% bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among democrats under the age of 50, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage for older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in support of the Sanders Liberal group was two figures, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of the neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats say they will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected candidate for the party.
A quarter would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters, even if he was elected candidate.
There is more fragmentation in the views among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
48% of the Democratic electorate would be in favour of Clinton, while only 35% of the Republican electorate would be enthusiastic about the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and third that Clinton is the best candidate for the post (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The vice president is still running for office, and 57% of the Democrats would like him to join the race, but one third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate for a party candidate is asked by the democratic electorate, the majority choose Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden, is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase her head start over Sanders. With Sanders in it, the head start is 20 percentage points and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be the best candidate to win the actual elections, but the proportion has fallen from 78% last month.
The second Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more believe in Biden's chances of winning the election itself.
However, democratic voters attach greater importance to their views on the matter than to candidates' chances of winning.
The voters do not regard any democratic candidates or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and leader types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered to be the leader type.
As many as 30% of democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15% of Sanders do not know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the voters' own ideology.
For all characteristics, about a quarter of the time, there's no opinion on Sanders.
When you ask voters about the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Minister for Foreign Affairs, most democratic voters say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed their perception of Clinton.
The Americans, more broadly, disagree.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the electorate of its own party considers Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when it comes to the views of all voters: Clinton considers that it is only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, a lot of people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the margin of error of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catching up with Donald Trump in the national support poll
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest support poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates grasped more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support among the Republican electorate in the whole country. The support rate has risen from 23% in the CBS survey conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month. According to a questionnaire published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would have resulted in a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all sections of the population.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, are far away, and the Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida shared the third position with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent in one direction or another. The survey was conducted in September.
According to CNN and ORC's latest survey published last week, Carson's support is increasing, with 19% of Republicans supporting him, compared to 32% of Trump's support.
In the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also in clear leadership ahead of Carson.
During last week's encounter with men, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of Baruch College freshman.
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in a state ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
The members of the Parish Department of the City University of New York, Pi Delta PS, brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at the baptism in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back was placed in a bag of sand of almost 15 kg, and he was repeatedly attacked in an attempt to get to a site located on the other side of the icy field.
Deng was first told to complain about headaches and then passed out.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Psi Division didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, allegedly waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told at the press conference that, however, members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the president of the division, Andy Meng.
"At this stage, members began to hide the instruments, placing the interests of the division above Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the shredding of the parish, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the shelling since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, the Deng family lawyer.
The departments and their members must be held responsible where the authorities must take an important step.
The grand jury in Monroe County presented five members of the division to be charged with the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with shelling and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or unofficially approved the shelling," Wagner told us at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed an operating ban on the division, and the national division resigned from the local branch.
This is how the interest rate increase of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) affects:
The rise in interest rates and the stock market became fragile, the yield of securities is rising and the economy is sliding into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
With regard to the economy in particular, we find in history an indication of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises interest rates aggressively, not always, but the key factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the officials of the Central Bank have already put a great deal of pressure on investors not to pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to how long it will take for the situation to return to normal.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
In the end, however, market players can see that any fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The first increase of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessup, Chief Global Economy of Capital Economics told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there is no impact.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how impacts can be seen in different economic areas:
As has been seen on the market for about a month now, the forecasting of interest rate increases instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be the stagnation of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12-24 months, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," the Deutsche Bank analyst noted in a recent study of the consequences of the rise in interest rates.
In the 35-year period adjusted, the market usually sees a sharp rise at the time of the rise in interest rates, around 14%, fairly steady for the next 250 days (an average increase of 2.6%), after 500 days normalisation, with an average return on interest after six share ratios of 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategist Barron's.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares tends to increase at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income starts to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if a central bank meets conditions that did not exist in the past and could accelerate the downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever in view of raising the central bank's key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal value of the 118 interest rates since 1950 has been less than 4,5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 saw 3.6%, many did not think it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5%, says Atlanta Regional Bank.
The rise in interest rates in such a fragile economic situation may be risky and may be asked whether this situation is different, said Deutsche.
Market participants have talked about raising the key interest rate throughout the year and the gaze on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee were to accept the withdrawal at this meeting, the futures trade only shows a probability of 25%.
"In our studies from 1950 to the present, all the lift cycles have been in a supercycle where, even before the downturn, GDP is rising very rapidly after the start of the upturn," says the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already going to be 74 months.
Fixed-income securities have also been volatile in the face of market increases, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change direction as soon as the first rise / fall cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, profits will fall immediately, "said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase will bring long-term and short-term bonds closer to each other and the curve will be even.
"High-yield bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's firm-yield securities analyst.
Interestingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future trend of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already a number of signs of financial policy adjustment," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, the credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank is tightening up policy.
To a large extent, companies that are mainly active in the US market will benefit from lower interest rates and local products will be attracted.
The outlook for indebted multinational companies is weaker, as a stronger dollar will make their products tilt on the global market and the debt increase.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months of interest rate increases," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet beat weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better in terms of quality, on average 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt lose most, "Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers will generally also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from a higher return, although experts are divided on how quickly the effects will be felt.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for being too popularised.
According to Bingham, it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor.
Also claims to be a copy of the BBC Music Awards.
Parliamentary Mrs Damien Collins, on the other hand, is accusing the Voice channel of impersonation.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of the Classic FM channel, and the accusations are putting pressure on the station to prove that they are offering other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that the broadcasting company's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is not very different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards award gala last December also receives criticism from Bingham:
"Last year's BBC Music Awards seemed like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, we are simply mimicking what is already on the market, "Bingham points out.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers much more live music and informative content than a commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3, I learned from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to living music and making music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works, "said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, the director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, said that the station must work harder to maintain public interest, as the British know classical music better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that was criticised for entering the territory of commercial channels, in consultation with the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory MEP, Damien Collins, criticised the "The Voice" talent search competition bought by the BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much to discuss, as it is neither unique nor particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the show proposed by BBC1, which was celebrated as star judges by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way by the BBC.
In addition, Collins called on the company to look for a hit program in its own garage when it next launched a new entertainment series.
However, Mr Collins did not agree to exclude that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be spent on other entertainment formats.
Growth in e-commerce is the slowest ever in August - perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
Three years ago, e-commerce became stronger with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can contain the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, many of Britain's shopping streets have been deserted by the online shopping conquest.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when sales of e-commerce have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth with the 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time," the editor of the IMRG, Andy Mulcahy, told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
"It enabled more and more people to buy online, and for many it was possible to buy in a different environment, for example from the sofa-bed.
As mobile shopping is now more moderate, growth may be even. "
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the anniversary of the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared with normal ones caused many traders' websites to collapse.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which makes consumers push for offers, can curb their desire to buy in the rest of the time.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a fair pound for every five pounds was consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping in fashion shops.
Mecca buries crane accidents victims, Bin Laden family in charge
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the major construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air when the Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane that fell over the Mecca Grand Mosque.
On their last trip to the Al-Moissem cemetery, a group of white-dressed people had gathered on the streets to say good-bye to the victims.
The mourner passed through the pilgrimage where the fallen building crane had only one day before infiltrated the roof of the mosque on top of Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden's construction family be held responsible for an accident involving a further 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims killed in the Mecca Grand Mosque crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the fall of the crane, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, the Great Manchester, had travelled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were about to begin their annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are entering the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the Group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are headed to the Great Mosquito for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a report on the crane accident and the group representatives have not been reached for the purpose of the opinion.
The King also accused the group of failing to comply with the current safety regulations and of cooperating with the meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the giant construction project of the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi-Arabian ruling family, and the Bin Laden are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident in heavy rain and hard wind took place just a few days before pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million repayments (approximately EUR 250 000) to the families of the victims and to the permanently disabled.
Other persons injured in an accident receive half of the compensation.
According to the B & Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind this phenomenon.
The British hire home generalists more often than ever, "says Veronica Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled workers from Eastern Europe, who work as professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, head correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home Hammering and Painting to authors from Eastern Europe.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
The British are now increasingly hiring home generalists to take care of home humping work, "says the director of the company behind B & Q.
Veronica Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the shop chain for home refurbishments. According to her, this phenomenon is driven by professional workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at the lowest prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new businesses-oriented Screwfix stores, while 60 B & Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B & Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the shop are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
She said that the demographic trends should be taken into account, as more and more women living alone are also rehabilitating their homes.
"The staff of our stores are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We must balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy the products are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process. "
Laury is one of the five women who are at the back of companies belonging to the British FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganised the company's management team in such a way that there are equal numbers of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only one because 50% of its staff are women, including the President and CEO and the Director of Finance.
"This was a conscious decision," she said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board."
Kingfisher's business profit and sales figures for six months show a decline, even though the company was most sensitive to work after the closures of the shops.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B & Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite rapid.
The sharp head of SAK and other employees' organisations began to be forced on the same day and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread expression of workers.
There are quite a few people who think that there is common sense.
Let's see if it's worth taking a strike when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50 000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
At an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but openly declaring a rich person would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not take much time, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the strong solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from the sky.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling around with their own weight, we are finally getting to the point, that is to say, the workers' rights to defend, prominently and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to put the role of the ay movement on hold, as membership of the trade union may perhaps be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the opinion of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
High savings for Lappeenranta University: €8.5 million in savings, 130 fewer staff
The Lappeenranta Technical University will start a course of savings aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start working negotiations on staff as a whole with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The core negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by government cuts.
In this financial year, the university makes a deficit of around 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding in our university is very significant, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the university newsletter.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding is now evident in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks under the law.
Yle: Onnbus wants to go to the Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, from Britain, tells General that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, says Souter.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is short-distance traffic in the Greater Helsinki region in 2017-2018.
After long-distance traffic, long-distance traffic is on the way.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed its interest in rail transport, which also has bus and rail services in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Time of the interest rate decision by the US Central Bank
The whole world will follow the Fed meeting of the US Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A good half of the economists who believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates are now betting that the Central Bank will maintain interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%, as shown by the questionnaire commissioned by the 80 economists from Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start normalisation of interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been in a relatively good state and the recovery has brought in trillions of extra dollars and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20.00 in Central European Time.
The shooter from Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting a colleague on the same day later, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he's sorry for the first murder and hopes he can cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, in Delta State University, Lamb taught geography and social science called 911 around 10: 00 in the morning.
On Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," said Lamb, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was no trouble to anyone, but he's probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body, and a handwritten message from Lamb, saying: "I am very sorry and wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After he wrote the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took his own life late on Monday when the police caught him.
University headmaster William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lambi and Schmidt, but said that Lambi was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no knowledge or evidence of the triangle.
For seven years, Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had resigned 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
Her husband said that her daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lambi for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives on Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lambi Highway 1 near Greenville on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the curriculum vitae on the University website, Lamb received a doctorate in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Decreased stars
The last few years have been difficult for an actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukemia and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months due to two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken at the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman will have to stay on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will be back in the field this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense area in the bad tackle of Héctor Moreno when the game was in progress for fifteen minutes.
Shaw was in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery in Manchester.
A young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has been through a lot of hard times and is now injured by great game moves.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when my leg breaks in two places, he's on the sidelines for half a month and he's not playing in the block anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten away with not having a red card kick.
The match judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can deduce for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a kick in the ass and a red card.
It was a two-legged, reckless tackle. "
Shaw tweeted like this: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how crushed I am. My recovery starts here and I come back stronger."
More on: Manchester United Luke Shaw at the PSV game
The British defender has a particular reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championship in France in June.
"This is a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm the opponent. "
Moreno broke his legs playing in the Mexican ranks of the Netherlands, which was created by Van Gaal, only in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball that was going in the other direction, so it looked like he touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle. "
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad. I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Every parent will eventually realize that the child will learn his favorite book almost from the outside.
Except you can see David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and there is a strong message. I like to read it to my children because there is always some image or message that we have not noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the next paragraph where Cameron is going to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to supplement a brief initial text.
"In the city where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey's dream girl by implementing this biggest dream: to see the right tree," the text says.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the census of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: "If necessary in a city where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey's dream girl."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kersänen will dispose of the trees and make supplies of them despite the resistance of the name band Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, moustache creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that this type of PR mission of minor importance has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative told me that the text probably originated from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard.
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we have seen the last 3-0 Test Series defeat of the team chosen by England for the tour, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest victory.
The Alastair Cook side may be more inexperienced than a team three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team attitude is strong - they have no bad experience of 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-pitcher, and Adil Rashid, even though he has no test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the England Test Team and replaced Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticised according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights would have been held on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he didn't do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test-batter will have the opportunity to make an impact is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground fights, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest matches.
The only thing to complain about is that England used Jonathan Trot first in the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales will be on the team, and he's a batter I appreciate very much.
He is a cricket player of unknown authors, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this obviously depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start the batting with Cook, which will give us an extra round-pitcher while holding four quick pitchers, and I am not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to having a top pitcher hit here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have made a lot of progress on his local team at Worcestershire, but he's been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first substitute player before he could start in 2001.
He scored three hundred points right away, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup helper, and based on what I've seen of him, he has proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics - on average 31 points as a batter and 35 points as a pitcher - and this may be a search shot, but not many spin-pitchers have shown that they are ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawardene, as the advisor to the Test Games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the cutest men in the species, which brings with it a great deal of experience, because he has been playing against all kinds of conditions and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball on a game trip and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to fit into an international cricket, whether his role is a player or a coach, and, like Mahela, he has an exploitable intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not prescribe a scheduled match.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never taken without consideration.
Brexit's camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is in a deeper and deeper marsh every day, even without the pleasing Jeremy 'yes or no' of Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the TUC to make a huge mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is struggling with - although not all of them are done - and some Member States are tired of Britain's smug agenda, which includes dissenting concessions and damaging Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual TUC Congress decided that they would not be happy in the EU either if it eroded social security.
Maybe we could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are hanging out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, capturing a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, returning home and telling them that they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have reached the point that they no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it is ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Holland will be faced with a re-election or a successor in 2017.
His power is fading, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them racing to help the Selfie British who could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to throw unwittingly useless comments in the Scottish National Party style of the 2017 UK National Election Campaign, which wants to speed up the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The renegotiation was a set-up." "Britain had nothing left to do with renegotiation."
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the EU-sceptical oligarchic press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum in favour of 2: 1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may well remember Boris Johnson, a petrified Euro-opportunist, who became known as "our EU direct banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax evaders, phone hackers and seemingly-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them pretty much the same way, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to throw bananas into a bluff so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was also more liberal than Blair when he opposed the referendum, and he agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the referendum in 2005, Blair got away with it.
The press never forgave him either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby who kindly clapped me in the back on Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have time to waste on me anymore.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who he sat on the BBC couch on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told on radio and on television this week when his internal scout tried not to admit that Corby was a bad move to appoint rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had trouble being disloyal on television to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU under "all circumstances." Mr McDonnell did not say so either to his colleagues and the members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday evening.
He wanted Corby to pass on any wonderful picture, must remember that he touched even me. Messaging discipline is important in the 24 / 7 era, especially in the strangeness of social media, where paranoia and fraud are entrenched.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass with regard to the EU, which, as Mr McDonnell has said, could take Labour's support for the referendum for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equalisation of EU membership fits into the bennet of the blockade economy and the anti-capitalist past. Discussions are no longer just part of a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents to whom the idea of similarity is a key lesson in doctrinal clashes.
There is also evidence of equalization in NATO. Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that Corby is not campaigning for departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the situation in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital; they have sceptical voters; why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be pointless?
The United States is already rather disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts that were made during the Tory regime, which I was reminded of on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the allegations made by a state-funded institution that the smoking of e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking resulted from a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
In the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal, the experts criticised the evidence presented by the public health authority in the Public Health England (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
PHE described its report last month as a "translation and comprehensive review of results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the Lancet Medical Journal's editorial adopted a "remarkably weak base" on which the PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two scientists have considered in the BMJ whether the allegations were set up on "rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health in Europe, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policy is based on clear evidence of its effectiveness."
According to Mr McKee and Mr Capewell, the general public assumes that the claim made by the PHE that "e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes' should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim arises from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model. The model sought to harmonise participants' views on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKee and Capewell, the meeting was supported by EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research by the President and CEO was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) sources.
In addition, in the sustainable activity report, the President and CEO showed support for the public health activities of BAT.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
The selection criteria for the panel composition have not been clarified, but there are several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom acknowledge their involvement in the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco manager.
According to Mr McKeen and Mr Capewell, the Group's study report shows that there is no conclusive evidence that products are harmful to a large part of the products and that they meet the criteria.
However, no links or shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that e-cigarettes can promote the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare in PHE, the allegations have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are much less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of smoking addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but long-term effects need to be further explored.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, almost 80 000 deaths from smoking occur each year and the cost of smoking is GBP 2 billion per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we make clear the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand in a series of hits, such as Albert Square, a series of soap.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should be used only for the production of programmes which are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the competitors' high ratings programmes and, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea of BBC buying formats and sending programmes that are clearly part of a competing channel's software," Johnson told the communication committee in the House of Lords, which explained the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply, at least to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC sends the Voice to the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If there's no other channel to take the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders the other, although it has its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand over it.
I do not understand how this serves the service of the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be losses to the BBC. "
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He thinks the BBC is looking for good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are in line with the comments of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell off series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the programmes for the BBC niche audience are displayed on the BBC4 channel, where ratings are often not measurable, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "The BBC can say when defending 4 billion pounds of public radio broadcasts in hypocritical missions and making special programs that no one looked at."
"BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
As regards broadcasting, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system with the same old-fashioned meaning that who gets the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 a year is affordable, but the people for whom it is a big sum, especially if you don't look at the BBC. "
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also gave his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its old missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment."
According to Elstein, there are hardly any teaching programmes in the current supply of BBC - 1% on television and 0.1% on radio - and he adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and start its mission to a new religion: "Inform, enlighten and entertain."
With regard to the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add more broadcasts to events such as the Proms festival, where only a fraction of the concerts were sent last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels so that the entire supply is also available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sonogenetics using sound waves
The video shows how the shuttlecraft changes direction when they are subject to ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically altered neural systems, allowing worms to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when subject to ultrasound at a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
Sound waves activate the motion nerve cells that are genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to the ultrasound.
More on: Researchers monitor brain activity with light
According to scientists, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method. The method uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an extraneous stimulus.
The Salk Instute researcher in La Jolla in California, Sleekath Chalasani, told Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, in which the brain is stimulated by electric impulses.
The nematodes normally do not react to the ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that the worms, however, start to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that advance into the worms.
Confirmed ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels found in some of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control the nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, microbubbles amplified the sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is slightly similar to optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenesis has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is used to direct light into the brain under investigation by using optical fibres. Low-frequency ultrasounds can easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be transmitted to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy will allow human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological therapies," Chalasani said.
According to the investigator, this method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices on your doorstep!
The commercials are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-gun fair video.
Bogey killer missiles!
Leg-breaking cuffs!
Grape bombs!
Telematics that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The joyous voice and cartoons clearly reveal that this ad from the world's largest trade fair is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government's attempt to sell arms to the repressive governments at the DSEN (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which is held at the Excel Fair in London, Docklands.

There are also posters in bus stops and metro wagons that require a second look.
"An important announcement: will you be on the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement reminds you of the London Metro announcements. On the other side of the metro line there is a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers will be asked to help to close the arms fair."
Three hundred posters were made by artists whose work was displayed at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Design.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound ad space hacking package with hexagon keys that allegedly have access to about one third of the world's bus stop advertising banners.
Transport for London is not funny about poster vandalism.
One of Special Patrol Group's joke ads.
According to the curator of Cruel Design and the lecturer Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many people move to work with protestors' activists.
One of the anti-arms posters greets public transport users on the subway.
The video of Amnesty has been viewed through Facebook over 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without remuneration by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the multiplier have also done their job without remuneration.
The artistic director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, hailed the absence of fair advertising and the empty spot on ExCeL's event calendar. He thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure business video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention. "
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us raise the issue of fairs where there is illegal trade in torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded on our doorstep."
However, the most creative gift of the Armistice Fair will be displayed in the exhibition premises at ExCeL itself, where the exhibitors will take advantage of the enormous euphemisms of their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the US military for "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "special-design warhead that penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student residences
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago, and I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in barets and moral relativism, and only now I remember the forceful smiles I provoked, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can summarise in eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorm is the most onerous experience and, at worst, shocking.
It's easy to talk about: tell everyone where you are, whether you liked the recess and why you like Corby and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, character, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask questions about others.
The question will guide the debate and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your eyelashes were on fire and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give the others some space.
Own rooms often act as drinking risks, cinemas and public spaces, but their own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More on the subject: Don't even think about combining dating and university studies
Introverte University is a tough place
A private room should be a place to calm down, but many homes have a social culture of wandering from room to room and making lifelong friendships.
A culture like this can be a nightmare for someone who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go away so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if any of your students are exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies at the appropriate time when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, slightly strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something small. Smile when I'm asking you for personal details."
Home-made delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are gonna have to talk to you.
Of course, this requires you to have reasonable bakery skills.
If you serve unhappy grits made of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Food is also a common violation of student housing.
Of course, stealing one chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop of milk out of someone else's milk can?
Always check the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get a permit, even if the milk quoting is a piece of crap for the owner of the can.
I understand very well that it's annoying if someone is picking something up from you, but try to deal with the situation as mature as possible, unlike my own college friend who put detergent in his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when the others try to sleep or go nuts.
Not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every one of you who digs a hole...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the occupants of the next room to adjust the volume of music, because it was 3: 00 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room was finally quiet, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, went to the exam for three hours, left the music to freshen up her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved to the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your study partner was your future partner, that you'd start dating, divorce, and have to see him every day and lose the right of your mutual friends to meet him?
The heart certainly wants what it wants, but if the student friend is not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a joyous moment that someone has forgotten their key to a room with a door that is not locked, the limit of trick and bullying is more subtle than one could think.
A good joke is funny, but one you can recover from in a moment.
Hiding some artifact may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door to the other room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't put anyone's things on the roof with a blue sticker twice as much.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - A house planned for reception in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made at the foreign student shelter in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors' asylum seekers, but the dormitories of foreign students who have been in Finland for longer, says Heidi Luukkinen, teacher of the Evangelical School of People's Studies in Kiten.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the People's Academy were tampered with by racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, "says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, the teacher responsible for youth guarantee training at the National Academy, there were approximately ten people at the time of the attack in the building that was being vandalized.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the National Academy.
They have already been students in Finland for some time, as well as minor asylum seekers who have just arrived.
All the people in the mess building have "A" status.
Some study in basic adult education, some in vocational studies and some study Finnish, "says Luukkinen.
The status A is a so-called continuous residence permit which can be issued for a period of four years for a foreign person who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, a press conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one has ever wanted to leave.
We have had twelve years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened, "says Luke.
Luke says the mess's been cleaned up already.
At least three men were suspected of being involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think that this is the whim of the youth weekend, when this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, "says Luke.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been tucked into which a reception centre is planned.
The case happened last week.
MTV told me about it on its website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written "You are not welcome."
A police report has been issued.
Revision 15 September at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information from the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y-train for Karjaa - the passengers in starvation, "totally idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karelia stops running in March.
The news made passengers indignant at Helsinki's main railway station when the train took off early in the evening.
In particular, the run-down strikes the people of Bengtström, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
This is idiotic because the number of inhabitants is constantly growing and those working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video from HSTV he'll come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main track will be merged into a new R line.
Puola station in Järvenpää and Nuppullinna Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes from which the Ministry will purchase train traffic in the following contractual period.
The contract period will be changed at the turn of the year and there will be routes to end throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, the Blessing, considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's the remorse.
The Y-train is also used by non-Raasepori and Blessing people, because it is fast and bypasses multiple stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling further away from the city.
"It is a misery for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he was in pain on the Y-train.
A little relief is coming.
A new train connection is expected to take place at the beach track, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y train, although the Ministry has much more than that.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts will double in Ainola and Sauna Rock.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made during the period when the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in 1867-1894, written by Yrjö Hakanen, a former chairman of GDP, today's book, the timeliness of Marx's Capital.
"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetration into all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and fictional capital have proved to be astonishingly far-sighted.
A book based on capital seminars organised by Hakanen can also be found on the list of authors of the Aalto University Professor, the prestigious financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is "now and forever."
But the former President-in-Office of the Institute of Business Research and the Delegation to Business is not Marxist, is it?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The common idea is that the history of the Atheism is about the false opinions of the dead men," Korkman starts.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now again discussing the interests of Marxi, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire those who want to understand the big picture of the world that is changing as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow won't help Marx.
After all, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be put to an end.
Still, it's worth getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," says Korkman.
"Maoists and Trotskis and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind world, as well as other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations is demanding war criminals for a conviction in Sri Lanka.
The UN calls for the establishment of a specialised court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, says AFP.
The UN report on the 1983-2009 civil war appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
The Sri Lankan Civil War is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
Even the number of victims is not exactly known.
In particular, the major attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men and women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighting.
Both parties have been reported guilty of murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of a UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In England's yo-test, you got to pluck social media.
On Wednesday, a long foreign language, which was English, was on the books of the autumn.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media if you wanted to.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the editor of the web-site advisory forum.
The title was "Dear Agony Aunt."
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of a Finnish Leelian chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
The total number of subjects to be covered was four, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the most difficult of them," assessed the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck said, was pretty nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts such as the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
Autumn writings will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish, Swedish or Finnish test will be in place.
In high school, the experiment is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' demonstrations.
The Student Qualification Board calls on the candidates to find suitable access in time for them to attend the examination.
Even more time can be obtained if it can be shown that the delay was not due to negligence of its own.
In Oulu, a store was robbed at gunpoint.
In Oulu, a store was robbed on Wednesday morning in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a mask covering his face.
He's normal-body. He's about 30 years old.
According to the police, he had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from the rest of Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will block downtown Helsinki on Friday, predicted by the police.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, for their part, are not only responsible for the alarm and other police activities, but also for ensuring the success of the gigantic demonstration.
The roads leading to the railway line will be closed off from motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30 to 14 a.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off from the road circle of Kaisaniemi, from the direction of the West from Mannerheiminee.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on police business.
According to Kujala, support patrols are coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell you the exact numbers of patrols.
"A little bit is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With the arrival of protestors from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Railroad.
The buses are pretty far away, in principle.
The rest of the journey must then walk to the demonstration site, "says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops the public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally present at these big people's gatherings, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, violence is ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good comparison point in Finnish political history, "says Emritus Martti Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
As such, it is no wonder that the ay Movement is protesting.
If it did not do so, it would raise hands in front of the government, "says Sistine.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is lacking in contract law.
There are many features here that are really trying to get the ay movement on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the demonstrations on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the Ay Movement would like to see involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament building in November 1993.
If you look for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a week in 1993, "Säisäinen says.
In the middle of the recession, a total of 20 000 unemployed people gathered together on MurroThursday.
Esko Aho's (central) government is stumbling from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay Movement may be even worse than it was at the time of the Murrosdag.
Besides, the worst bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, "Sisainen says.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so strict right-wing, despite the speeches of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the crash.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
It also stops public transport and may close kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the indivisible support of employees, it can become the largest in many years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the Finnish day-to-day demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is obedient to the law.
The protestors are trying to avoid harming or destroying property, "Sistine says.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on their heads.
The strike for firefighters lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes, among other things, by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electrical strikes
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and power strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal strike.
The strike was suspended with the presentation of the Reconciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Fracture Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of them made redundant, met in front of Parliament's House to show their support for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg egg production by farmers protesting against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For the spa, the farmers were dripping tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
The operation threatened with a strike and collective redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies finally accelerated the outcome of the negotiations.
The doctors were on strike in 2001.
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors' strike lasted about five months and resulted in a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched from the Senate Square to the Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013 for study support.
The Central Criminal Police are investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the background to the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The guys on the truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, "says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the Broadband, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug dealer, and a wealthy businessman, the story of five smugglers.
A gigantic king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at Trento University, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and their book The Travel Agency of Death will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different levels of business.
The HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The islands of Kerkenna on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are going there for the summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain-burning captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for fishermen to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
After one trip, Emir makes about EUR 8 000.
Emir has five deputies looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisian wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis brought about another collapse.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers are just about to survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
There's a lantern going into the water at midnight.
The first night you drive off the islands, then you stop, wait for the day, and then you drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is going back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least he claims to beat the hell out of them.
He tells in the book that once the police snapped at him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
I hear he's got to beat up his fellow countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter engine is pulling its last few, and it's seen its best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi moves at all and moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly admitted.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without family are accommodated in tents, carpets and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
Families also live in the forest, who for one reason or another have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovasha area, to the great hub of human smuggling, people are exhausted.
Goran's cytans are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he tells in the book.
"They say their business once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Foolish fool fool all the way.
First, the price is set at EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice man with a good heart.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, "he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only EUR 50 per person on the Hungarian border.
It's about 100 miles, most of it's comfortable on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran makes about EUR 50 000 a year.
It's not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care; he knows the ways and the shortcuts, and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and shouts away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the missionary preacher, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where there are many believers fleeing the Congo, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees that he does the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants gently peers under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and goes on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the five number numbers of the missionary.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, to hide the money wisely and to infiltrate the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the authorities of Uganda must be informed that they come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have had to flee violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity card will be destroyed and replaced.
That's where the missionary contacts with the Uganda Police Department help.
The client will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, ultimately the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows red tape because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He invokes each step separately: an application to the Uganda police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process to a European country, for example, between EUR 4 500 and 7 000.
Foils and ice cubes
Tom is a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on call on the French coast in Calais, where it is his job to load people into trucks on his way to Britain.
He has an Afghan driver in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truckers who may not even know they're in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 freeway and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting here for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's on its way to England and not even to Holland... and cut off the safety wire on the protective cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in an aluminum foil similar to the one that is wrapped around a roast or an oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping that he won't be driving a sudden stowaway, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
A gigantic Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal landings of the Mediterranean, who controls maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only wants the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are renting yachts to take American or European families to a comfortable tourist cruise for a few days.
In reality, ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghan people who are transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000 first from Istanbul to a port of land and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People get stuck in minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you have to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Marine Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink will be given, but the less the passengers will poop and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 from one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not deal with practical things himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, tenants and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer period, transport will take place at least hundreds and Küçük will make millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments through cover companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner who competed three times in the Olympic Games, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, is about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts in the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran for the second best time in qualifying.
But in the finals, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership in a manic race.
But 150 meters before the goal, his powers were exhausted.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line. Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
He also overtalked his husband into accepting his actions.
Favor Hamilton's fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury heap.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was also that he missed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received when he was competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's number one statistician in the time of 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympics.
The champion of the world rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straight Back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have twisted the whole summer and autumn, like last year, from a sports contract.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for many times the world champion and the Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming period.
The decision was praised by a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the season of the national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent an alliance that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to play solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the Union has given Northug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release, in which he assured us that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the World Cup and then at the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in his career, two gold medals.
Last winter in Falun, he was on the team that won the gold.
Translator's tortoises are also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25.9, there are stunts in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Shifter Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food competence and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of a high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but that the top restaurants, which are controlled and classified by an impartial operator, are available throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event reflects the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the tortoise restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondikse and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town takes part in a tortoise day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most important international events that take place throughout the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of Kauhava Admission Centre
The Office of Immigration and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a reception centre for refugees in the premises of Kauhava's ex-garrison, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent presence in the region of critical infrastructure during the crisis period at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Special Networks Oy.
The Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Airline School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
In the case of Kauhava Airport, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The issue has been discussed with Mr Jussi Niinistö, Minister for Defence, and Mr Arto Rädy, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The town council of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Ninekistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought together all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially at these times when we face major challenges
The situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and hence in the Baltic Sea region.
The Nineparty is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to have an impact on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Nineteen, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Day-care centres around the clock and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of the disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Education Agency promises to provide further information on the changes in activity tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among the others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become repeated.
According to Sipila, speeches may not always be transmitted on Yle's channels in the future.
If you sign up for another channel, we'll see.
Now we use this channel tonight, said Sipilä.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech to be given to the public.
This dossier, which we are talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
Speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also view it in the Yle Areena.
The onion is taking a big risk.
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about the more general inward turn of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and to refuse questions from a public debate?
Reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he is not following the media agenda and not allowing it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not interrelated.
Kovunen understands that commercial media is indignant at the announcement by Sipilä.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers do not form part of democracy.
It is the role of media representatives, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agents are not taken into account.
According to the birch, the television talk is a big risk to Sipila.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there any more of what we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Kovunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
There is also a risk in this respect, if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be marked as a means of communication between politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general approach.
A clever move from the onion.
In the forthcoming speech by Mr Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister has not said is emphasised by the media scientist.
In the evening you should look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where she is not, "says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to the Kuutti, the TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because this way he can bring out his own view without any sound of gravel.
In this way, the message will be given to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
The onion passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions will be asked.
According to the bullet, it's very important how Sipilä plays on TV, currency sweat, shaking hands.
He compares Sipila with a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good point, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform us about something, because here, it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and its partners are doing on a regular basis (President Barack of the United States).
Very exceptional.
The political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the public.
He said that it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that is ahead of him.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says that Sipilä could take his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announced that he would challenge the Sipilä dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy is dead and his father updated his Facebook page.
The police department of Sisä-Suomi also confirms this to the evening newspaper.
The kid went out to play around 4: 00 this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks all the people who helped us find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed with the violent wildness of young people: you will bring anger to you
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish fighter, published a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people from a migrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani said he was going to press against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of the free match.
Amirkhani says she received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos uploaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in young people's craziness.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick people in the country, sit on each other's heads, and punch without thinking about the consequences of this when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people who appear on the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Commissioner of the Helsinki Police, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting on the street at all.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, as my Turkish Amirkhani reminds us.
Mr Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come up with an awful lot of things.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
That's a different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhan urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by any kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for that.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate that I don't like either.
You guys are pretty bad at it anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, Amirkhan decides.
SAK puts forward its position on the savings package - Lly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, says that the Workers' Association will consider on Monday its position on the alternative savings list proposed by the STTC.
Lauri Lly commented on the STTC's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the STTK delegation announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akaka are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the main employee organisation, SAK, soften its previous position.
The Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, said little on Twitter.
Mr Lyle writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyle, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock," and that instead of forced laws, agreements by active parties are needed.
Mr Lüly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä terminated the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: The big demonstration is threatening to get fat - "It feels a little funny to get a fist."
After all, it's kind of funny to put your fist on if you already have a tissue paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the wage and salary camp.
Are we going to call the government off, or are we going to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK broke out their holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to be caught.
The threat spread even to the Akakaans.
The teachers' trade union, OAJ, threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be closed completely.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), President of the STTK, appeared in conciliation.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) as a 5% productivity leap.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder (Kok), rushed to announce that his conciliation paper was already ready.
There wasn't a sound from the SAK office at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reconcile when, just on Monday, the federal leaders told us to put the country on a stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Mr Lüly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock."
In order to create a joint performance of employees, the SAK would have to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of Palola, Director of Social Destruction of the STTK, Jukka Ihanus used to serve as special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Mr Palola therefore described the fact that the government's ay skills have been constantly improving.
Coincidence or no coincidence, but Palola's output took a little bit out of the Finnish standing-ups, whose foreprint is the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put your fist on if you've already got a tissue paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information on Lyle's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, at which Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Summit in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Mr Naryshkin, to appear on the European Union's list of sanctions - something that the President was able to remind journalists of.
We estimate that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Interfax, the news agency was stressed by Mr Naryshkin.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Mr Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, as declared by Mr Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation made it to Mongolia without any difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to stab Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), the head of the meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already spoken to the Russian delegation according to Russian media.
The lock meets the true playoff troll: "Paints tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue the oxen days in Hakaforest today, when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that tonight in Hakaforest we won't see any real goal parties.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to dig a 3-2 overtime victory over Kalpa.
The rise was masculine, as last season's silver group was at its worst at the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was a lot better than that.
The Blues, who started the Raumaan harvest with a hard start, had a round zero score, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if at all playing the same game as last year, Clutch-assailant Janne Lahti predicts arrangements on the club's website.
The killer has formed quite a playoff nightmare for the poor.
In fact, in the last two years, the kill has just dropped the Clave from the final series.
Both times, a decisive seventh fight has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the show to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three to the side and past.
With the exception of goalies, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashier who rejected both of them yesterday will receive a flute shift today.
With a hit goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: Just in progress with a lousy play
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, written by Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the leading role.
The defendant sensationally put a heavyweight series on the combo for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy when he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed pot shop progressed to everyone's surprise at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Matt, and a Pele Pelo Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the irokees.
Hope's a blonde.
JP Jalo, a great TV reporter, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the novelty of this season is working in the same way as it was ten years ago.
A man who works as a recent sports manager has built a pot shop on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating up guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have earned in some other game than puck.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, Pekka Rautallio plays the main role.
The Karri Stone is at risk for Sean Connery of the Iron Bowl.
In Toovola's manuscript Rocky, the Iron Tallion is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the iron bowl except a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Alley does not include running around and sipping.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ace Garret Stafford tackled Tappara's Jere Karelian head.
He got two plus ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron Tallo put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play for us are those who deserve it.
I don't approve of such a game, and it's not part of the ace puck, and after the game, Rautakallio was hot and pissed off at the people of Satakunta.
I mean, this season's team has been built strangely.
There are juniors, veterans, cops and bullies.
In practice, there are no key men in the best age of the game.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence players, Pekka Rautallio?
Last season's events have an impact on procurement and, unfortunately, the market situation was rather limited, the Rautallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface.
In 1953, Rautakallio was known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports manager.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The current balance in the three league games of the season is equal to the score of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bass player and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but this is the first time Olga has played under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in the first year of Apulanna, you made us beautiful, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuki Cricket.
The cricket spins and supports his son, even though his father Risto (represented by Lorenzo Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me to play the part.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
Cricket has helped so much.
We've been through a lot from different angles to their history.
The Cricket also fortunately understands that drama is drama and the truth may have to be painted a little bit.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
There was a recession in the '90s, and it was really bad.
There was a pretty small chance that someone really could pull it off, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the movie plans.
But parents' stories have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Heinola's notorious skateboarder Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At best, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga says that over the past ten years, she's been working so hard with Tuukka that a big joint project doesn't scare me.
It's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in the East often plans to drive home for their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start shooting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation in progress will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
The film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa starts in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so sick, I've been so relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he's gonna tell the evening paper.
Originally, the film budget was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million could be introduced into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no loose ends.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years' time at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film shows Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
You mean like hillbilly or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The trendsediers' breasts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until a while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The promotion of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrendi, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wave.
And as often as before, the line between funny and trendy is slim: if something is a hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the Norm core trend, which is the custom fashion, where trendseters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a gray basic college, you put on that sweatshirt that's buried at the bottom of the closet, with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas's recognizable track sweaters, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees have also returned to street fashion.
The beginning of the jeans' edge is now a cool detail with the calvin Klein logos.
The trend seems to be moving from sports signs to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what kind of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to show me some logos while you're dressed?
A Russian politician published evidence that I didn't get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
It is claimed that an extraordinary incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, the Russian war industry product producer, was held.
In recent days, there have been colorful claims in the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to be peeking through the armored vehicle's hatch in a very good atmosphere and at least from those pictures it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the battle tank. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am an ex-soldier, Colonel. I have served at the Ural.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out in peace, and Zotov said Comosomolskaya to Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army television channel that he loved the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage. I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and rosy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, it didn't happen, he said Russkaya sluzhba novotei radio.
The words of Zotov are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stowage have been published, even though a total of 50 000 people went to the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Bloknot.ru case, where Zotov was told that he was struggling to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to shoot everyone around him in the end, unless he got out of his grip.
Later, the Blocknot site published a follow-up article in which the exhibition organisers reported their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armoured vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But under no circumstances did he sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.
This is the favorite piece of interior bloggers.
The architectural brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlelight from 1962 looks like it was planned today.

There's been a leak at the Kittilä mine in Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is either pumped to be re-used as process water or passed to the environment as authorised by the surface discharge field.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaching water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the material went into the environment.
The leak was detected during a round of inspections on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structure of the pool has been observed.
The company states that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuuppäki: IMF warns against overcutting
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland towards comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole treaty system and for unemployment protection.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
The IMF assessment contains a lot of pro-government messages, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be overcut.
These are investments in infrastructure, for example, Kupapäki says to the Economic Messages.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to grow by 0.4% this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today predicts a zero growth rate in its new cyclical forecast this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest sightings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuupapäki.
It has again been possible to pay less attention to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are limited to a few per cent of decimal places.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satuu Iwata for cancer in July, starts his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata responded to the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessed by Hideki Yasuda Reuters, analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima's task is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but so that it does not eat company bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers enter Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Office, hundreds of minors are missing every year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Office of Immigration tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear "underground" per year? - In 2013, a total of 156 unaccompanied minors' asylum applications were made in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, "says Kannelmaa.
The reason for the disappearance may be that, in the course of the proceedings, it is clear that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the examination of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 were subject to a termination decision because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the rate on the increase?
This year, by 6.9, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a single minor.
The total number of missing asylum seekers is not yet available this year, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who decide to convert?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the 'black labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Office, because the police are responsible for the implementation of translation decisions, Mr Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister for the Interior, Petteri Orpo (Kok), has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates.
He has taken action on this issue.
At the meeting of EU Ministers for the Interior, Orpo, who considered refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A., a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to seizures, for TV and radio production by Mikkose, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen is selling on Hütuto.net equipment that used to be one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online ad was the first one to tell us about the website.
Today, a large part of the equipment is at the forefront of technological development.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
But Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and people who build their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their present home in Myrskylä.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started. Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no use for TV and radio equipment anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkose's actual life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of boredom worse than expected: Metro and tram can stop by Friday.
Today, the drivers of the subway and tram will decide whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, we'll find out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
The cuts in the night and shift allowances are very painful for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
The deer wonders that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region will virtually be stopped.
VR reports that trains don't travel between 6: 00 a.m. and 6: 00 p.m.
There will be no local traffic or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that left before 6: 00 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses will be left at the station.
ACP members will be out of work on Friday morning and 3: 00 a.m. Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a superior force, the HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell us exactly which bus shifts are on Friday.
The employees' organisations will hold a major demonstration at the Helsinki Rautatietori on Friday at 11-13 a.m.
Aftonblade: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in a panic.
According to the local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas. The teacher thought he had a homemade watch as a bomb.
In the United States of Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher thought of his homemade watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was showcase his electronic hobby.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked just like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said that the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
This case happened last Monday, and Mohamed was punished on three days' compulsory leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether it is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain roars - Labour leader refused to sing national songs
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is an adversary of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, believed by the laboratory representative Kate Green in a radio interview with the broadcaster BBC.
Green thinks Corby should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial was a tribute to the British Air Force pilots' battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and emphasises his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood quietly during the national anthem with respect, the opinion stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the lab.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to appear in Parliament in the capacity of party leader during Question Time with the Prime Minister.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was a party leader on Twitter this weekend.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister referred to it in his own account.
The cause of the death of the Minnesota family was still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the death of a family in Greenwood, Minnesota for almost a week.
A five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three kids with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the Short family dead in a huge house all over the place.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A millionaire house and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, Police Commissioner of South Lake Minnetonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his assets on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short told us that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've been offered 50 buy-ins over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was seen in the fact that the Short family bought a house in Greenwood for two million dollars in 2011.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream site in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was awaiting trial.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no comments that blasphemous prepping courses had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me coffee.
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos horse owner prize for the month.
This is great. Loiri commented with a good mood on her honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the success horse gets full working rest while working with the horse.
Pekka rules and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri burped.
The stunning gesture of the NHL star, "The greatest donation ever made by an athlete."
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital press release, this is the biggest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, Subban, 26 years old, is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his annual earnings of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive from the hospital a hall with his name on it.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
The long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening, serve only bikinis and apron on top of them.
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat shop, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug shop and now a wife's café.
It strikes lonely, downed and hungry.
Metro will be reporting on this.
At Ore no Yome (my Finnish wife) in Tokyo, you can order a wife or a husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be a client's wife.
The "spouse" will be selected from the list before entering the café and he will prepare and serve food.
The wife is facing just an apron and a bikini on top, the husband in tight bike shorts.
The website offers all information about the women's candidates about the length and weight of the mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: attacks on car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as described in Intel's release.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRR researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cyber security.
The company will in future update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB study.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company, Gartner, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing online data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
ASTRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and to support the view that cyber security is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been awaited for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car is also starting to be in view in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the looks of the car world are in Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finland, it is provisionally reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in its press release.
Kia's favorite brand introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Car Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
More important than two new developments in Finland is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to capture a bigger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage created under the leadership of European Design Director Gregory Guillaume is more round than before.
There's a quarter of an inch between the axle and the outer dimensions, and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but it has been added to it by a 1.6 litre turbo developing 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We still have to wait for it, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimas arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the buyers of the upper middle class with improved driving features, lower noise levels and a higher level of equipment.
Optimum is obtained with 1.7 liter turbodiesel and 2.0 liter petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine arrives.
At the same time as it arrives, the sale of the Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage... flapping in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
In an electric blue panty suit, there is an impressive, open neck opening.
The costume is a beautiful introduction to the songwriter's chirowy waist.
The size of the crown is gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has lost weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer published his first single on a new record in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related stuff, the singer tells me.
In a few weeks, Chisu will publish his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astonishing again - now you see the breast
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives talk one by one.
She's showing her pregnancy stomachs and her bra in sexy clothes, last night at 1: 00 in the morning, when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left her husband's Kanye West gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It will reveal the skin-coloured bra under the dress when the lightning lights flash.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity costume when he was visiting a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black upper knee boots.
The third special maternity costume is as recent as last week's Friday night, when it was a pregnancy stomach.
The rough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model, Manon Lelope, wanted to take a short look at the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, where Lelope and his colleagues are talking about a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six hard truths of Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the last season you were posing in top designers' costumes, the new season will begin again in Castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with connoisseurs.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their designs.
If you're very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of skinny.
Agent New York may be asking for a pound, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks run out, the difference will be bitter.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a demonstration of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
You were in the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently having fashion weeks where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film.
In a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band, Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band.
Apulanna was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to imitate a person.
The man who pilot the Scrooge Salminen and Dogs will not play the role.
Punk manners come along naturally.
The stars, the stars in the punk episode of the show, I'm sure a lot of people saw the foretaste, just as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything cute. We always go full-on.
The leading actors of Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, made us beautiful, were released today.
The core group, known to the public in the band, is presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bass player Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he told us in Snapchat that he was secretly preparing for the most important day of his career.
Mr Roope has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Roope, seen in a mustache and a chin beard earlier, has shaved his face into a chipmunk and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think over the last few days about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it at all?
We do not need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises us.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children can't always understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has collided with television news images of refugees or has heard of it elsewhere, it is worth raising the issue.
It is good to have a discussion about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he is asking.
A child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child follows closely the behaviour of its parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the debate, the child will feel safe.
Bigger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is best for parents to discuss this with them if it is a matter of concern to the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world have things right.
The parents, together with the children, can think about how this is going to be handled in our family.
In the end, however, do we think that the world is safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety wherever possible.
On the other hand, if you talk about difficult things in a family, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
It's hard to control the Vermo-striking Pallus.
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine the impact of Apila's Pallosalama in the middle of the summer.
It only raided victories and second place until at the end of July there was a collapse in the Tampere rave.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the observation.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the most mild, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
In Turku, it was the second SE in its record time after Taruntuvi.
Apila's Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure from a break when it had been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Given those things, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that the Ori were hit by a fair competition.
The horse must have moved on from it, and hopefully it would have settled down.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called funny horses.
When you haven't had fun with it, it could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the Ori have, on the other hand, removed such a lightning bolt that their opponents have been amazed.
At the speed of the cut, the contestants will not be able to cope with the Pallosalma, which even gives off warm-blooded rides.
The wishes of the North are a nest run in Vermo.
But the difference is how Apila's Pallosalama agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might just stick under the boom and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than Turku is about to leave.
Apila's Pallosalama can come out of the bow when she's in shape, and we're going to drive it for a win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO, Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones can be deleted in the future - but not all of it.
Apple intends to remove some of its own software from iPhone phones in the future, "says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Leaf Kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into this because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent from one year ago, and Eurostat, the statistical authority of the EU, announced today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called "base inflation" fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper than one year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in Malta, or by 1.4 per cent from the euro area.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still a long way from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area at an average rate of 0.1% this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1%, with the central bank anticipating in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
US Fed next tries to blackmail monetary policy
The next US recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years of the country's central bank Fed starting to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, downhill starts before the next recession.
Mr Fed has suggested that he might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession can hit us at its fastest by next autumn and as the course of the financial markets before that.
Or at least this is what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have done and react to the extortion of the Fed taps as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international large-scale customers last week.
The strategies that drew up the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they present economic statistics using cool facts and calculations on how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed increases.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at which key variables of the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous increases - and what might be the consequence of this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shaky state to cope with the rise in interest rates as well as once since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to start a recession.
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have been suggesting throughout the last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in over nine years can come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds key interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, a series of relatively regular but at a time small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, which led to Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years ago.
In 2007, financial market symptoms began with the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis tore to a global nightmare of doomsday.
A major downturn occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic hardship began at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the previous Fed increases.
Correspondingly, the trials were tougher and more harsh than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turmoil in financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Since the 1950s, they have been reporting on Fed's increases in interest rates and their economic and financial impact.
The start of the recession has reached its peak of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years from the start of the interest rate increases in Fed.
Since the beginning of the 1950s, Fed has alternately raised and decreased its steering rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time has deviated in some respects from the other, and the time is relatively limited, so it is hardly possible to conclude on the effects of subsequent increases.
Strategies therefore point out that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, are not necessarily determined by decades of research.
But for the reasons leading up to the crisis and increasing its destructive power, there are three things that are quite undeniably clear:
1) In the 2000s, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble while growing the next one.
(2) The accumulated and already excessive debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy has increased even further as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history since then was created.
(3) In particular, the low-cost debt financing, which was almost halted in the financial economy, inflated to most aspects of the financial markets the biggest price bubbles in the history of the economy so far from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Again, there is hardly any serious dispute that the financial markets, which have risen above ever more complex debt levers, were in an extremely dangerous and unstable situation when Fed and the other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The financial structures on the levers, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last as long as the interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche strategies do not know what will happen next, but give cause for thought by mentioning, for example, the following aspects:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago; now, at its cheapest, debt is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt ratio of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now there is a much heavier debt burden in the various parts of the economy than before or ever before the financial crisis.
(3) The liquidity outflows from central banks have largely remained on the financial markets and have left the main types of securities and assets at their most expensive, whether at the peak or at any time before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategies strike the scene with warning signs on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its money taps.
Perhaps the future image of Albert Edwards, the strategy of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as the sudden appearance can be.
For a while now, he has been coaching the Bank's international investor customers for Fed's following translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to run off the financial fires with even bigger QE injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed towards HP's business service side, the company says.
In November HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer pc machines and printers.
HP had a maximum number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced from 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reduction on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65% of the operating result was imported by its three most significant customers.

Upper: Minister Berner has been active on the board of the tax havens company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister for Transport and Communications (Central), has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company, Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still formally a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, "says Berner in the interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The ownership of Kährs, a Swedish company, is managed through a Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Government of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and, after the merger, of the Government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner tells the General that he received government membership at the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked to have a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and the starting point is secured in this context, "says Berner.
Berner tells General that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the capital fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens the reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo opens the first reception centre operated by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today, starting at 6 p.m.
Within a week, the number of places can increase to between 300 and 400 persons.
The Office of Immigration will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Academy.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, which is specifically concerned with the provision of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Office and Luona Oy agreed, among other things, on the Centre's security arrangements.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmail.
The association also wants other employees' organisations to be involved.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be restored.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, and Palola pointed out to journalists during the meeting of the organisation's administration.
However, Palola estimates that the Central Business Association (EK) does not have the capacity to discuss.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change security provided by the Government's competitiveness package is estimated to cost the employer EUR 30 million, compared to EUR 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party is terribly keen to have a conversation if you have a one-to-one ratio of 100.
Palola: Constructive connection
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) has wished for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to present a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Mr Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, the cuts to the STTK field, especially the Sunday allowances, are a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would be implementing part of the blackmail.
According to the STTK, Palola does not warm up to preparing an alternative package with the SDP involved.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work-related blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, salaries for the first sick days are cut, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to express their views and that the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder praises
Mr Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STTK on its announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK is now on the same lines as Akava, since Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK led by Lauri Lüly will come along to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Mr PALOLAN STTK announced earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is prepared to negotiate the 5% competitiveness jump that the government is seeking as an alternative to cuts.
The week has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want security of change and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same coal..." playing bingo when Sipilä speaks tonight.
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left at Tampere University tonight.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made special speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05.
When applying for the last speech of the Prime Minister, it is necessary to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he made the famous radio speech which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers held several radios during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen put an end to the train operators' strike on television.
It's monologue, monarchist stuff.
The chipmunk's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said that "Sipilä could make his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "a monologue has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Doors of the SDP condemned "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them."
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon, six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
I've tried.
What is it you're afraid of?
Public service
According to the Council of State's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lüly, and the CEO of the EK, Jyri Häkäman.
The general has been criticised for presenting the Sipilä speech.
We considered the matter and said that it was a public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, a line on the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like we were in the Oak Age ♪
The speech has also aroused ridicule.
When the evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be scrubbed and dressed for their best.
My mom puts on a prettier piece of junk and my dad puts a tie on her neck.
At 9: 00 p.m., we will be silenced to the TV like I used to be when we were in the Oaks, "says the blogger Saku Timone.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why the Finnish Government sits in the tax havens with millions of people who hide their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the money is out of the state?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
It's published the bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the debts of living and the team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 21.05 and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan whereby, after some time, al-Assad would have left power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be contacted immediately, and the renunciation of al-Assad had to be carried out calmly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we will be able to have an open debate.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, and Ahtisaari will remember in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats don't comment.
The Ahtisaari says that he sent a message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Mr Shurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all the agreements by which he would remain in power.
The former leader of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Middle East, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari has said, because in his experience Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power to some Al-Assad supporter.
The influx of refugees for our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, around 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves created, the Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The organisation centre for asylum seekers pushed to Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the building of the Tornio joint lyseo, which is empty in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsinki Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the Council would have already decided to present the school building as a state solution to the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Tuupkinen (left), that is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would point out to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the conference.
13 delegates were opposed to the Centre.
On that basis, you could expect a positive decision, "says Tuuppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and a rapid response was received.
It is estimated that 500 asylum seekers would be able to join together at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, "says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central), half of the holiday money in public would only cover part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the government.
However, he said that the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners managed to agree on this.
Ms Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that she had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly be happy to accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be an effective means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut-off of Sunday allowances.
The social partners could agree between themselves on the reduction of holiday allowances, as they are recorded in collective agreements rather than in law.
With this view, next Wednesday, the government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a communication from the Council of State.
Mr Sipilä said that the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then take off, i.e. the train will be on the move and will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen, if there's any will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published last week by the government includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and the Thursday of hela into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the first days of sickness are reduced, overtime is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these efforts, the employees' organisations are holding a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have also declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the sahlahalli warehouse
The board of directors of Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the warehouse of Nordic Koivu Oy, the mahlahalli.
The criticism was made by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than what was originally talked about.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that it would cost an estimated EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the local area.
The municipality has no risk as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väisto (ps.) explained.
The Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous steep position to bring street signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of preserving the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not proclaim to be the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu is more part of the Eastern Savolish dialects.
After a new decision, there will be no street signs in the centre of the city.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth taking an open-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still specific to the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both can well be used for the various marketing activities of the province.
Decommissioning of trains cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the county's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the regional economy and competitiveness.
And that affects whether we can live and work here at all, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points to air transport, which has also been the subject of a number of reports.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not succeed in reducing the possibilities of state intervention, as is now happening.
We should look at the effects of these cuts in transport connections, for example on employment, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration in accessibility poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor accessibility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because of the lack of cross-border access.
About one-half of students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for the war of you
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the provincial Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is also one among the gravel voices.
Mr Pentti Keskisalo, Member of the City Board (sd., in the picture), presented at the government meeting on Monday that the whole project should be abandoned, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit less than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train shifts is left out, but still five times a day from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
These reductions are the result of savings by the State.
The purchase of train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely shut down.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The Rescue Department let a 12-year-old climb off the roof, who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at 6: 30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder at all on the roof.
It didn't stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur tower next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
The result was that the others slipped away from the scene and the passers alerted the rescue services to help the last one left safely on the roof to the ground.
FedEx's net sales fluctuation, weaker prospects for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its weak performance for the last quarter. The transport industry left its profit forecast weakened throughout the year due to the fall in demand for freight services and the increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trade opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast is down by 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened by an average price increase of 4.9%. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. Additional charges for the land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company is still looking forward to an increase in profits from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in the online trade.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans to hire seasonal workers were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit amounted to USD 692 million, representing an increase of 6%.
The result per share was $2.42, which means that the prognosis of the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research is $2.44.
Turnover rose by five per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been affected by the decline in international first-class shipments, which has led to a stagnation in the activities of the company's Express unit.
The strong growth in e-commerce has confirmed the outcome of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the actual trade, FedEx's share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11 per cent from the average for the year and 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the Fed decision-makers of the United States Central Bank will meet for the most expected meeting in years. The group will sit at an eight-metre wood table in Honduras with a diameter to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the decorative two-storey conference room of the Central Bank, a painting of the United States appears.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the economic interest of the State above all other interests.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the Central Bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece of a delicate decision. On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start weaning off the unexpected stimulus offered by short interest rates that have remained close to zero in the end of 2008.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in the financial markets can already scare the staff of a prudent central bank into increasing volatility by raising the reference rate for federal taxes - even by a percentage point in a quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist of the Bank Movement Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty on the global market will give sufficient cause to wait," Piegza continues.
Those who are considering it do not agree with what the Central Bank is up to, which in itself is causing nervousness.
About half of the economists in the Bloomberg study were wondering about the rise in interest rates this week.
In the financial markets, however, it is assumed that the central bank is waiting and, according to the key indicator, there is only a 30% possibility of an increase.
If the central bank raises its steering interest rate, the share rates may fall unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The momentum was driven by the expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, Chief Economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of financial market players from shaking."
The second expert noted that raising interest rates could reassure the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said that, throughout the spring and early summer, he has been waiting for interest rates to rise this year - despite the fact that the Liberals say economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest in seven years and close to the level that the central bank will fall into full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% targets, central bank decision-makers noted that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the tight situation in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world did not flinch last month when China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 percentage points from the record level in May and investors feared that the economic downturn in China would also have an impact on global growth.
The market has picked up this month and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% from the top of May.
The turmoil in the market means to the decision-makers of the central bank that it will become even more difficult to reflect on how to raise the key interest rate.
"The work of the Central Bank will become more complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," according to UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, Senior Researcher and former Central Bank Officer Stephen D. Oliner.
He now believes that the Central Bank is waiting at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information on the situation in China after recent economic developments," said Oliner.
In principle, the reorganisation of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern and should not affect the decision-making process of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most powerful financial entity in the world.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scope of its operations caused revolutions around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined and, in addition to monitoring developments in the world, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of the Finance Management Company Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Bank of Richmond stated this month that the Central Bank had previously overreacted to financial market movements that seemed to have no connection to the basic economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who has the right to vote in the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering rate, and has highlighted the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999 as an example.
"The Asian economic crisis led the Central Bank to decide at three meetings to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only limited sanctions were available for US economic growth."
A year later, the central bank overturned the decision.
"The central bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, as in the economic collapse of 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate panel.
The latest turmoil does not even bring us closer to the situation at that time, "he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates because of the shock on the market," added Posen, the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability; until this changes, I do not think that we should get ahead of ourselves."

The Brazilian Rio Granden Childcare Association promotes a decent diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Rio Granden Children's Association SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach breast-feeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so that the baby gets all the food they need and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to the increase in calorie intake, other changes should be made to diet.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead on their Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson urged Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the liberal party's presidential election, which, however, did little to improve the ratings of Today.
The Nine Channel breakfast program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage created a competing channel in the morning from London. Special weekly broadcasts are also being sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
In the meantime, it appears that the Australian television viewers were irrelevant, as Sunrisea looked at an average of 397 000 spectators in five capital cities, while the Today programme was seen by 339 000 spectators.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but were left reading last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught up with Sunris in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunris had 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 spectators and Today 314 000 spectators.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had a significant novelty of 800 Words with a former Pack to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached an amazing 1,219 000 spectators.
The critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor held a strong position with 1,136 000 viewers. The Series was a clear defeat of The Block (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in a variety of ways.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour of the new quiz series (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446 000 spectators.
In the second half-hour (17.30-18.00), the audience rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers in the first half, and the other half gathered a huge 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's audience was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second-night ratings showed the Nine Channel that Hot Seat will pass until 5: 30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge the McGuire series.

The final triangle thinks Sam Wood really is the bachelor of dreams, but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed the choice of the Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood, the bachelor of dreams, has been a carefully guarded secret.
The three remaining women will not say a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We questioned Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they dropped one out of the three.
Sam Wood's lips have been sealed tight until Thursday's final.
All three women glowed that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised a man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity, and considered him a suitable partner.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not fall into its own place, their answers could give an indication of who is taking the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were very good together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, and she's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized this wasn't just a race. I'm betting on our relationship now," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood would have to choose if he didn't choose him, she answered in mysterious terms:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as you do." "Snezana and Lana are even."
The bachelor of dreams on the Ten Channel Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m.
The case was originally published under the title "The Choice of Sarah Sam Wood"?
Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also became interested in him after last year's impressive open day of practice.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like the choice hit the spot.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man did in the ranks of the Australian rugby team. Hayne screwed up after a win on Tuesday from Minnesota, reading 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed that he trusted Hayne and gave the man a second chance to return the kick. The coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued to play in the locker room after the game.
He didn't rob the newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers specialist, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is going to screw up the game against Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
Hayne and her Australian fans had been expecting something else from a man's NFL debut.
After a failure, Hayne left the field at hundreds and later told Hamish and Andy that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the error in her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when her feeding in her region opened up a place for Queensland.
Overall, however, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
In Instagram, Hayne published a picture of her posing with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Kodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at an airport in Siberia at gunpoint.
Mr Kodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was expelled and his pro-democracy work was restricted.
Four dead police officers shot with rubber bullets, protestors in Nepal.
Four people died in southern Nepal, the source of authority told us on Wednesday. The police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, including a four-year-old boy.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area, just under three hundred kilometres from the capital Katmandu.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before shooting rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill, but are generally considered as a less destructive alternative, suddenly were so deadly.
It was the most recent confrontation during weeks of protests on the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent squabbles since 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, which is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive subject in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working on since 2008, but the legislative authorities have speeded up the process since thousands of people died in the tragic earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and according to the authorities, the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
About 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde islands, a tropical cyclone could develop within the next 48 hours, announced by the National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, a clear low-pressure centre is also located in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone with a 60% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and were starving, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migration crisis escalates, many families in similar situations urgently need help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children to the Society and UN Refugee Organisation.
After the donations have been collected at google.com / refugeerenelief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount to 11 million in total.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since the Second World War, which is particularly exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people fleeing their homes this year.
War must also escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mild obese diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
A new study has shown that slightly overweight type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly overweight type 2 diabetic patients after obese surgery will live longer than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"It takes time to get the mortality data," said Robin Blackstone, doctor of obese surgery, who dealt with a new study in JAMA Surgery.
The use of fat surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes over the years. However, most of the studies have been conducted in obese patients with body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The body weight index shall indicate the weight and length with a normal value of 18,5 to 24,9.
When the body mass index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the body mass index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your weight index at 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese hospital Min-Sheng used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass graft surgery and sleeve surgery, treatment of type 2 diabetes in slightly obese people.
After obese surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
In non-surgical patients, body mass index was maintained around 29.
In patients undergoing surgery, the overall rate of improvement in diabetes was 36% and in part 28%.
In the drug-treated group, only 1% and partly only about 2% improved diabetes.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and high LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical arm.
Researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin-A1c levels to measure how well they developed blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended level of haemoglobin-A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
During the fifth year in the gastric bypass section, weight loss was higher than in the sleeve section (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight index fall was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and diabetes improved completely in the bypass section (46.9% and 16.7%).
The new study failed to show a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone, University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery will lead to life years for fat people.
In a Swedish study, the probability of mortality during 15 years was reduced by 29% compared to the traditional treatment group for obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone stated that it was confirmed that persons with a BMI of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study as it states that surgery is safe in a lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that are subject to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in its visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Complsion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must prevail over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how to achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"After all, we must consider how we can reduce the number of deaths in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
The means of force have never solved the problems, "he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that, in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come from non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Handband ingestion cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgian poison centre, poisoning centres across the United States indicate an almost four-fold increase in alcohol consumption in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgian poison centre, the reported cases of hand-ingested ingestion to poison centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are going to emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handsets intentionally, some to impress their friends and some to be encouraged by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant for cheap drunk.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol-rich mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smells like a pair of hands can attract smaller children.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large proportion of attractive hand decimals are just fragrance.
It offers strawberry, grape and orange-flavoured hand decimals that appeal to children. "
The alcoholic strength by volume of the disinfectants is between 45% and 95%.
Small amounts of alcohol can cause alcohol poisoning in young children.
"The alcohol content of the hand bandage is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the intoxication centre of the University Hospital in Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whisky shots in the hands of children, but if hand disinfectants are often left in the hands of children, they quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four lorated strawberry-scented hands at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The blood alcohol content of the girl was 179, which is twice that of the adult drunk," says Chris Ritchey, the doctor who treated the girl, from the Gwinnet Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah made a fuss and couldn't walk when they brought him to the emergency room.
The doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage because she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol, "Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes in addition to moving your hands out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontarian women died from ingestion of hand detergents containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was declared as an active substance in the product fiche.
According to the police report, three four-year-old students in the north of the state of New York planned in January to kill a "evil" teacher by setting up antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hand dishwashing and said not to bring it into the classroom.
The police took the view that the plan that went to the myth was meaningless and called for disciplinary action on the part of the school.
Rumour mill: no discord in Celtic lines
Griffith belittles the discord of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right, but believes she can get the situation right.
Hearts buttons against SFA with Neilson's punishment, and Warburton will be careful about January player transfers so that team unity does not suffer
Aberdeen neck Celtic five points
The punishment of the first half of ADAM Rooney brought Aberdeen a modest victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen five points on the run from Celtic.
Griffith is belittling the words of discord.
Griffith has ignored the rumours of the conflict in the ranks of Celtic, according to his own words, Griffith and his team are not under observation as they prepare to face the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch need an old Scottish battle partner - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and the Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has fallen short because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers' duel.
Mr De Boer, who was in charge of the Ajax team, said: "In the Netherlands, the highlights of the Celtic games are no longer presented.
Because the Rangers are no longer with us. "
"We're not just talking about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Company.
The Dutchmen need a team-to-team duel.
The Old Company games are under enormous tension and are also of interest beyond Scotland's borders. "
I'll turn it around, Deila will convince me.
Ronny Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that the situation will change.
The company lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sadness in many people.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, as this will considerably strengthen the players.
The spirit of unity is now very important. "
Warburton careful of January player transfers
Even though only a few weeks ago, Ranger boss Mark Warburton tipped off the January transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer slurry and says that he wants to jeopardize the integrity of the team.
"In January, player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," said Brentford's ex-coach.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful this season in our lineup.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause more damage to the team than benefits. "
Michu, Retirement Retirement in Celtic's Aim
Swansea's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic in player transfer speeches. Michu has suggested retirement at the end of the Swans agreement.
For years, a 29-year-old Michu has had an angry ankle and failed to get transferred from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready to fight SFA for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collar red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffith swears he will avoid Tynecast.
Griffith was reprimanded when he admitted to slandering lyrics about a former Hearts player named Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecast in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming, and the mood was intense," said the assailant. "I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the ranks of Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that Dundee United's management team can make things better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight, "Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with the Hamilton victory with a dirty game.
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to stand up to Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league victory, and with his victory, Aberdeen caught a five-point neck in Celtic at the top of the serial table, which is to thank Adam Rooney for his punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," said McInnes.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed, while in the United Kingdom the number of unemployed grew by 10 000.
According to the Office for National Statistics of the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate was 5.9% in Scotland, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The number of employed persons in Scotland is 12,000 lower than three months earlier, and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with an average employment rate of 73.5% for the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Scottish Minister, David Mundell, commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland took a historic decision to maintain as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has fallen.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish to see, I will sit in the execution room of the state prison in Oklahoma, when Richard Glaulop will be executed by lethal injection.
Glaulip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I was invited in January by a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I said yes to the invitation.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I do it?
I agreed because I thought this was how I could tell a true story about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States and, as there are more applications than seats, participants will be selected with a macabre lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
The chosen ones will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glaulip's closest friends, and I've created a man's personal relationship because we've been on the phone several times over the months, and one visit took two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be present as both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that he likes, you will be near him. "
I gave the reporter my dissenting opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but he still thinks my actions are wrong.
Richard Glaulip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I won't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glamep dies, he believes that the public will contribute to the fight against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, journalist for Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glaulip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glaulop is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I am following his execution.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
You can read an unbiased description of other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
He was lured from the Canningriver after a watery police officer.
The Canning Vale district officer remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthilian man's escape went into a shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few meters away managed to land him back on the ground.
Canning Vale police got a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they discovered a suspect who was trying to lose track of the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and asked the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted by the watering of his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - a negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt makes people resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned their car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across the river Swanjoki.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the trick inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees tried to spy, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames the agents of Racing Victoria for trying to spy on him last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai for the treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for a competitive sport. Moody has been in a difficult situation when a cobalt was found in the Lidar sample and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody's been keeping his tongue in check about espionage charges for a year and a half, and he didn't want the accusations to affect a bitter man's actions.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration unfolds once in a while," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the farm after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well tonight.
I want the horse owners to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't think I should be a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to consider my future as a licensed coach. "
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the integrity department's espionage attempts on his garage.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him the name of the man when he asked for it," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, then they should present the evidence, because I have not been caught by anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the activities at that time and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal pursuit?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in this sector on the part of non-coaches?
Am I bad for the business?
Do you really think I'm bad for the business?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I should get a coaching license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that I'm going to get a lot of people to think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw. "
A long-lasting investigation into Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection situation finally made the coach so frustrated that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, who described the day-to-day care rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been illegally placed in a clay wrapper.
"Treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it, "Moody said.
"A person belonging to my staff misplaced clay on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race. "
Moody can expect a three-month non-compete ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know the horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far, "Moody said.
Escaped from the Cobram crash site.
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist this weekend who escaped from the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car crash on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who was driving the car fled the scene and didn't stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia checked in with the Sheppard police.
The man is likely to be charged with failure to comply with stopping and assistance obligations in the event of a road accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm refers unreservedly to opposing wrestling.
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm considers the game of his team's tackle to be a purpose-seeking activity in the two league favorites of NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach Trent Robinson, the judges allowed Storm to wrestle in a qualifying match won by Melbourne's masters in Sydney on Friday night.
The coach Wayne Bennett of Brisbane Broncos barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying finals on Saturday night at Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that Queensland didn't care much about wrestling.
Bellamy stood up for his own team's tackle game and said they were just focusing on contact when they hit.
Bellamy added that his trust in his team was increased by the fact that his team was criticised by the coach of two top teams. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that the coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I think Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, and for the last six weeks, we've just been putting a lot of effort into contact games and tacks, which has turned us up.
Trent has been on his mission for three years, and the loss may have been a shock to him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It is funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne's talking about an interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game with our Friday game and thought their game was interesting, "Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George received a lot of criticism about his boring game. Wayne said that his criticism would not give him a second thought.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast center attackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play in his style, and not all teams have central invaders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when the other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that there were more goals in Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or is it football that's interesting?
I think the objectives make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably face them. "
Storm has a free weekend, because the team will be visiting either the North Queensland Cowboys at Cronu Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serb man on bail for $200,000 in a drug case.
A man waiting for a possible life sentence for a 40-kilo cocaine attempt smuggled to Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after police found a 100 kilos of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera in August.
The police watched the meeting between Maximovic and his accomplice at the marina for the morning and surprised two later at Coomera Road House. A 40-kilo drug shipment was found in the car in the parking lot.
Although Maximovicia expects a life sentence for possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer there is no evidence that his client has tried to take over the entire batch, but that he may have been in the café for an innocent purpose.
According to the Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "said the judge in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 bail, against which he was released.
"Having read the testimony of both parties, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrendered his passport to both Australia and Serbia, registered daily to the police and remained at home between 6: 00 and 6: 00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the paedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to capture pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and checked in to an online messaging service where she got another user to send herself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and she noticed it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she screened the contents of her phone, she found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police. After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a cop in order to scare paedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson stated at the local judiciary at Dundee Sheriff's Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on human intimidation.
He admitted that he did the searches on the computer, but he claimed that he did so to play police and thereby intimidate the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who had sent him the photos and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead paedophiles.
He told me he had disturbing thoughts about drinking and wanting to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When she found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw some inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked considerably younger.
On 14 June last year, a 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to the charges of possession of inappropriate child images. Hogg violated his bail release on 25 January this year and failed to come to court for consultation on 24 March this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be placed in the register of sex offenders, since it can be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence for October due to background social work reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but he was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the record of sex offenders even before the date of delivery of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe giving the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest Head of State in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened was quickly released in social media.
The opening of this House was also overshadowed by the allegations made by the opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats, warning them that they would not book Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, Members of Parliament booed and suspended the President's State Speech in Parliament during a recess, which the President made on Tuesday.
The MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) piggyback, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages calling on them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is" death, "Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside Parliament representatives are no longer immune.
According to the party bishop, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving of business services business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will separate computer and printer business from faster growth of business equipment and services.
According to the HP Communication, the company will record a one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter onwards.
"The restructuring will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of over $50 billion and the company focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
In the 1930s, a company founded by the students of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is now divided into two parts. The two of them founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of the Silicon Valley.
There has been massive restructuring of HP as traditional desktop computers are moving from mobile devices.
Changes in the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and in HP, which is one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in a sector where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Artta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four England national team games.
The biggest problem with the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season after a severe ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new period.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries. "
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also said, further injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debut six years ago.
He also played in the Arsenal ranks in only 65 of the 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight seasons of team members have been the second of the teams that lost the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a potential vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to evolve in a better direction.
"Sometimes a post-injury return can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive leverage," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves. "
Arsenal will start his work on the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspuri next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare some minor changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Artella are likely to be starting.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to balance the team and give people who need it rest," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F-Group to continue, Maximir Zagreb has one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games during the time of the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the country wavered at a strength of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson of last season after having had to bend to Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant desire to take the team on the road to the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers. "
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men
A similar description of his absence in other shows is remarkable, especially given that men's need to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide statistics are at their highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) takes up the problem by declaring 2015 the year of men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In the recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, there is a better chance of getting better for people with depressive symptoms if there are enough healthy people around them.
There was also a halving of the likelihood of the illness of asymptomatic persons who had no mental health problems in their immediate vicinity.
But everything is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitisation of life, the need seemed strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all taken into account by our inner values and our natural longing for personal growth and friendship.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money cannot really buy happiness.
The thing about the frends is that the show turned the focus upside down.
None of the characters in the series were defined by occupation, but by personality. This was reflected in friendship relationships.
In the series, Joey and Chandler were humorously hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that the men were able to identify with this, even though they were not completely abstaining.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems. "
"Friends are one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family. "
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the set has been revived. So if you attend the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can develop.
Comedy Central sends the whole Frendit series - all 236 episodes - to the # FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinburgh Cavan after he scores against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria managed to score in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and assessment.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started working in the Champions League by hitting Malmö at the Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She strengthened the position of the French champions as soon as handshake. However, PSG failed several goals before eventually being able to increase its lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A-section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is seeking not only a follow-up in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for quarter-finals in the three remaining matches.
Although SPG scored, the match was not the perfect performance of a team created by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a goal position and the man had to change when he was facing his former homecoming, where he began his huge career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in guests in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win and the good hands will provide a good basis, even though we still have some cheating for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury. The team had to settle for a 2-2 tie in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux this weekend. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in the shade at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to the PSG, was named the solver of PSG, which will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of being named as a speeding ball for the entry of Marco Verratt past Malmö's defense and then launched a precise shot at the rear corner of the goal by Johan Wiland.
However, those who were waiting for the PSG to be crushed were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players from the start. The team playing with five men's defenses and two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely missed by Kevin Trapp's goal of the Tacolapas at the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half only. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the goal to the back of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic pointed his fingernails at the feed game. Di Maria fired a spin kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was born during the count thanks to Cavan. The Uruguayan, playing six-way, shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmo's letter ended with a second goal, and only Wiland's top-notch at the close range of David Luiz's shot kept his readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was rejected at the very end of the mile.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide subsequently admitted that PSG was in its own class. "We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Qualifications are not enough.
A hat for the Parisians.
This was a top-of-the-line match. "

Damon and Brown had gathered together with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character will be presented," Brown said at the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People was in favour of Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon replied abruptly that choosing two could lead to an undesired outcome.
When the conversation was on TV, social media exploded from Damon's disapproval comments.
The Twitter user, Mr Pooni, expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "Matt Damon speaking on the sole dark person to explain what diversity is, is so white that it hurts."

After entering the lead, Hughes gave one hive hit to second Ian Kinsler on the first shift.
The real helper J.D. Martinez's free pass brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
