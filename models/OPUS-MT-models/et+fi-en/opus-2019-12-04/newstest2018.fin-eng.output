Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's doing art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body."
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Project Room at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a long-term story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you about my personal medical history so that the violence of the process can be seen," says Auer.
In the process, he refers to the process of gender adjustment.
It is often a year-long study period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be launched by means of a "gender identity disorder" diagnostic study carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before that, he had been using the oestrogen he ordered over the Internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
She felt like a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through a repair process so that sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the establishment of transsecular sex (563 / 2002), obliges transgender people to be forced into sterilisation so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, in the Population Register Centre and passport.
At present, every sex-corrected person is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive infertility.
A man has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
There has been talk of the reform of the Translaw in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and there is a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Justice which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous government of Finland prepared an amendment to the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election and the Finns came to the government.
Now the change of law is stuck again.
It is a matter of domestic policy disputes which have nothing to do with this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Finnish Department of Amnesty.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer as a psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote on this basis a report that would define the care of Auer's court and help.
The perception of the reality being studied appears to be vulnerable to instability.
The perception of himself is seen in a borderline manner in a fragmented manner, and the instability of personality is highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," says Auer.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given sexual modification treatment.
The medical staff said his resources weren't enough to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpol waiting room to the TV.
Later that television created a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflexed his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any human being named a woman at birth can enlarge his breast, but you need a diagnosis to remove her breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything but the sex of your birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
The process of gender correction is more severe for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
The people who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and help should be denied treatment on the grounds that their resources are not sufficient," says Auer.
Many people who have applied to the process have underlying mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these considerations, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing care and assistance can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process began," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started taking hormones, it made you feel better.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed since childhood and when he was a teenager.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit into its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to explain yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer already feels seen, he exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of close relatives could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people who are close to you have sex.
"They should know, and they know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, which means that the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, official confirmation of their gender cannot be obtained.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination with regard to legal sex.
A full-time applicant makes a written application for a new identity card stating that he or she feels like another sex.
After a period of six months of reflection, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall assign the applicant a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement also includes the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer exhibition Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The NGO issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The national NAACP organisation for the promotion of African-American civil rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory practices and racist attacks by the State.
"The travel information sheet of the NAACP for Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls for special attention to be paid to African-American tourists, visitors and locals and for extreme caution when travelling in a state where a number of questionable racial events have recently occurred. '
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult for cases of discrimination to be brought to justice, and the implementation of state law is disproportionately directed towards minorities, which according to NAACP led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin colour and beaten or killed, "said Rod Chapel, Chairman of NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases before in such a short time."
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organisation's first warning about the state of the United States.
The organisation mentioned, for example, racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and the Missouri police arrested him, even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel information note also referred to a report by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police are 75% more likely to stop the black driver than the white one.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People need to prepare, for example, by including money for bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
In 2015, according to the FBI, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteen most of the states of the United States.
Travel warning is also the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, which defended the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the Association, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Upper: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the Executive Director's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister for Economic Affairs, with responsibility for Corporate Governance, has asked Finnair for an account of the additional pension payment received by the airline's CEO, Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the Minister, it is contrary to the will of the state.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vauramo came up this week, when Helsinki Sanomat announced the development of remuneration for directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti news on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair told us that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has determined that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The government owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's policy decision on corporate governance.
The sanctions got a lot harder to talk about.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be on the way from cold to warm.
In the context of the G20 meeting of industrialised countries in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be working well together.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted bitterly in Russia.
The most striking response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the sanctions law signed by Trump means' a full-scale trade war '.
Even if Russian reactions only offset political rhetoric as excesses and excesses, the tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of honeymoon following the choice of Trump.
In the United States, it was not easy to pass the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Although Congress adopted the law with considerable unanimity, it was said that it was much more difficult for the President to adopt the law.
Trump therefore criticises the law which he has just signed as "a significant failure."
Russia in particular must have been the cause of President Trump's obscenity, although the adoption of a law restricting its own prerogatives must have been repulsive.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States both on Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections and on the Russian links to the Trump campaign.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the staff of the White House have changed to a strict level and various scandalous developments have almost been revealed, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a catalyst in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is intensifying relations.
The EU has made a visible contribution to the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State such as Finland, which has a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US Sanctions Act are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovo nuclear power plant project.
The acidification in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions, for example, of liquid natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means to demonstrate disapproval in world politics.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well-considered and accurate.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Ain't nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
Interference with the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know that as well as anyone else: with American soldiers, the Iraqis knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Abosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a vocabulary exercise on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly judge the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by a bunch of cruisers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was about the meaning of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus's poem - 17 years after the statue was completed - was added to its pedestal.
This is how Miller set up Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller wasn't wrong in his own right, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
What is important is the words of Lazarus, the only kind in which the state calls not only immigrants, but "the poorest of the poor": "Your spent, your poor, / Your hudled masses during to breathe free, / The wrote refuse of your thematic shore."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Mr Miller did not make any literary criticism; he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of the broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue, and they were well aware that it was a strong political act.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republican by a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
Attaching the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American ethnicity.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh - a mouthplayer who can now be regarded as some kind of sign of Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives who take the US torch to a world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He's taking the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States. "
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and weary but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and painful journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforting by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want under any circumstances.
Their torch does not show the way, but spills the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the British national team.
Neil Black, President and CEO of the British League for Sports, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships on Friday in London.
According to Black, "something special is happening in Scotland," which must be taught by British general sport.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake," says Black.
"I had a discussion with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish League of Sports believes that it is linked to the activities of the Federation,
and the British League of Sports believes that this is the basis for their actions.
And the average street guy thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, this is something absolutely wonderful, which is why. "
Many Scottish athletes in London are in serious competition for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are competing with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, wherever they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a true sense of passion and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the international community championship in the 400-meter fence race, and these are his fifth World Championship. He thinks it's "incredible" that there are 16 scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 meters in London, and it is worth keeping an eye on him as well: he has an excellent season behind him, including profits from the British World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championships, when the only Scottish member of the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "incredibly proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are in serious competition for final seats and medals.
"It is a great honour to be captain anyway, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes who compete for prize spots.
My captain's speech?
I think it went fine.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have homecoming.
It is important to enjoy the support of the public at home and the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere is gonna be amazing. "
Obstruction of critics on Facebook: Do not stand for public office if you cannot stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics, always in his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism pissed you off.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as fools and quiet as sheep to slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The United States Civil Rights Association sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unfounded, and his attitude was also understated online.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many comment.
But it matters.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic State.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive hot dog.
He has led the state firmly and firmly and firmly on the principles.
He has also used Facebook skilfully as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published there a picture of a balded head in chemotherapy.
The Governor's website is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax resources.
Mr. Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, and he said it was just a question of moderating comments.
However, the labelling of commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, for example teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They told me that their comments were respectful, attentive and relevant.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of the Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked questions about hate crimes.
"I politely comment that I am disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments of the Washington Post News.
"Nor can I accept that, when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as some sort of organised group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "a centralised attack." Someone else might call them to promote what was considered to be important.
Facebook's era of communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial publications or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But the truth is, it's the same thing. It's just digital now.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chairing Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by President Trump.
A first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of the District Court of Alexandria, the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment to the United States Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the United States Civil Rights Association came to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington, low-cost postal charges had the same effect as the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous writers slapped Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they called Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, the United States-United Kingdom Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as reflected in the documents collected by the Paper of George Washington network project.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the fundamental stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
There have been samples from about thirty places, and also online reports of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but then from the individual Haapavee and Seinäjoki, the specialist Marja Isomursu from Evira explains.
The green fins have died of a disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa known as Trichomonas gallinae.
In the past, it has been known to strike pigeons, especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in mallard birds.
In 2009, it hit me real hard.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch stock, after which the strains of the species have been on the road to recovery.
There have now been sick greens, but at least not yet on a large scale, "says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
It is to be feared that the previous outbreak of green fins will recur if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field service at the Renaissance Club.
The former European top player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home-field advantage for the next three days when Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament next door before the final round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has been fond of a new place and acts as an emissary for the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a keen emissary of the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field. "
This is the first time that Eales, an Englishman, has defended the championship, even though he has won his 32-year career both on the European tour and on the European competition tour.
"This feels like a very special occasion," says the player who lives in Southport.
"I didn't get to defend my victory over Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we'll always remember. "
Gary Orr is going back to the real thing on his own soil, and he went on a tour after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing at home is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far. "
The trio will be accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots are participating: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Parking the car costs £5 if the car is only a driver, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Säkylä investigated possible indoor problems of the barracks
In Säkylä, no indoor problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's communication company; the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Inland studies will continue.
The investigation began when a man who interrupted his garrison service for health reasons thought that his health had deteriorated due to bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified with the health status of other garrisons.
It turns out that this was an isolated case and that there have been no health problems for those who served in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment it is not known that we have any indoor problems, says Holma.
The Brigadier's press release says that due to the arrival in July, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which could have led to a temporary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of it, "says Holma.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove to cook.
He only rarely uses a pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he makes dinner, he usually puts sweet potatoes - locally "nota" - directly on fire.
In half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the cranberry will be eaten with greedy bare, unwashed hands.
He sits on a muddy painting where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as in the dark water from the nearby bowels of laundry.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in a room with no roof.
Degei is the youngest of his husband's four wives, and he is not assigned to the fields to be treated.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after five in the evening," says Degei.
This is a rare peek into everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The accession was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1 026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch regime, quickly turned its anger towards the Jakarta Government, which strictly controls the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotali is remote and has a hole. The trip starts on an hour and a half flight from the capital of the province from Jayapira to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the stomach with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
There are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences in a city of about 19,000 inhabitants, the rust of which has dyed yellow brown.
Only a few Indonesian people have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, the Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshipped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrapping head, dark skirt and bright-colored sweater.
"We used to have nothing but leaves over our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is an uplink about the size of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometres from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most productive gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, because they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, and up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
The demands of Papua for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and will be silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings on the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s gave rise to the scale of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 people in peaceful demonstrations in the region.
The Brisbane archdiocese report of 2016 contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular means - and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases on a weekly basis," says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher from Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Muslims move to the region in the hope of a better livelihood from the Indonesian population in the Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi islands.
Java Warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"Movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Panama and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia - his nickname Jokow - promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustice and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including in Panama, on his way to Jakarta's presidential castle.
But little has changed on Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," you say.
The Panians experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the comment, but according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the drunken soldiers captured the children and assaulted them on a rifle stand.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans - young men and women and children - gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for festivities, and they started to play the traditional Waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in the ring and mimic the bird song.
Some of the protestors started stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers in the internal radio system were given the order: "If the human forces resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that the Times saw, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto region, saw the situation get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told Time magazine about his bright-colored wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot her, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"Several gunshots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and I made sure it was really him," said Yohanes Time with sorrow. Like many Indonesian people, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for the Papua Police said in 2015.
"Then it's life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The next day, knowledge of the murders was carried to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
"I want this case investigated immediately so that nothing like this will ever happen again."
In October 2016, Minister for Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he began to withdraw his words immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he had no intention of starting studies on Papua.
"Everything will be cleared up in court," he said.
The UN is accusing Wiranto of 'crimes against humanity', which relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told Timé that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Panama.
The families of the Panaian victims are gloomy about the allegations.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had beaten him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"Soldiers find me after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the area next to Paniai in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which started when the manager refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital. Among the injured were children.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been on the water while fishing in a nearby river, and he died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were stoning cops who responded with warning shots.
According to the locals, however, the moving police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, and one villager was killed.
"We are terrified. We fear revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and for a mobile police force to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real progress feeds dissatisfaction with the Mei, Moni, Daniel and Damal tribes that live on the wheat highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papuans through occasional attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Panama, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arbitrarily capturing thousands of people in Panama in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of the people who were arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
Enarotal has only a small amount of rice to sell, and it's too expensive for locals.
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five batat fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
In time, the differences in the livelihood of local and migrant residents have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go local to better trained and more wealthy migrants.
Only a few Papuans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business in a competitive manner.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The remote Papua gets a little bit of attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, even though they had been given a rare photo permit, officially due to the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Asia, Jokow has not kept his electoral promises; he has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by removing the restrictions on news.
"Newspapers from the troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua, face new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting," said Ms Kine in her statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numerous and widespread violations' of Papua, including the Panai shooting scene.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
The local authorities want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Bari, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, the anonymous source who attended the meeting explains.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuans say that they are no longer likely to vote for Mr Jokow.
"Jokow means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Gobai, President of the tribal council.
He wants Mr Jokow to know the situation of the Panians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in deprivation and poverty, practically without health care and education facilities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the other Papuans, regard the votes they give to Jokow as "debt ', which must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite intimidation and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again displayed a symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in a country across the street from the police station and the military headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says on the head.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora barks of Robert Helenius' withdrawal of rematch: "Even his own fans don't want to see."
The heavyweight fighters Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora's recent interview with IFL TV shows that the reason why the rematch was completely flaked on Helen's shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora bores me.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the rematch went down modestly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told evening-Sanomi in May that the match had been moved to the fall.
There's been no news of the fight since then.
However, the withdrawal is no longer a pity for Chisora.
The fight would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
Thursday, three days before the fight, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My cock was about to explode.
The hospital said I need surgery, Chisora says.
The British say that they are currently in approximately 45% condition.
He's not interested in a rematch with Helen. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December by a split vote.
The fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai the second time.
The flames invaded the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to escape from a building of a height of 337 metres, 79 floors.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes, "a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Authority, fire extinguishing forces were able to shut down the fire at 4: 00 in the morning at local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in the Torch building in 2015, the board commissioned a study in which it was found that the boards used for upholstery and insulation of the facade were the most affected.
In the UK, police believe that the isolated and upholstery plates of the London Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid development of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensua during the night.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensua between 9: 00 on Tuesday and 5: 00 on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Ninerisk at Tikkamaentie 2.
Mopo was Sky Team Monkey by name.
It is red in colour and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.
Police are asking for sightings of a moped or its theft by e-mail to this email address protected from spambots.

Modified on 3 August 2017 at 12.40: Police announced that the moped had been found.
In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited articles on board, reveals a survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited articles by aircraft past the roadside inspection points of the United States Road Safety Agency (TSA). At least 6% of passengers had knives or other steel-bearing articles that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said they'd only found out afterwards that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
The survey was answered by over 1,000 passengers and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers who knowingly violated the TSA rules were Y-generation representatives and less than 15% belonged to the X-generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids on board.
More than three per cent acknowledged that they had deliberately taken steel-bearing items into the aircraft. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they had deliberately taken banned medicines on board.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the contraband had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travellers are most likely to also export contraband goods through security checks - knowingly or unknowingly.
However, as the company that conducted the survey points out, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids may be carried and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while there was also the belief that books should not be carried on a plane.
Fluids are allowed for domestic flights, but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, has made his decision to delay the decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions.
The day after the 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, Director of the EPA, the US Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the smoke-reducing decisions taken during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he commands takes better account of the needs of the Länder 'environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt never mentioned the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Länder should start to comply with the 2015 level of ground ozone from 1.10 onwards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the implementation of the decisions forward by one year, so that his agency would have more time to study the plan, because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the last setback for Pruitt's plan to relax the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that the head of the EPA exceeded its mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama regime's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged them to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full translation of the ozone regulations merely strengthens EPA cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on a timely basis.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and then waited for the activist groups and others to challenge it to a court where a timetable can be agreed," said Pruitt. He sued the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous action.
"We do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider change in the ozone regulations.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The state's attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the state association that sued the EPA this week, told us that the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
"The change of mind of the EPA as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the action included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Land ozone is generated by the reaction of emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants in the atmosphere to sunlight, for example.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups, as well as contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promotion and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's sudden change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing use of common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump regime, as its ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other self-serving groups."
A SUV from a supercar manufacturer becoming a street SUV... "happens in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while at the same time trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News news.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savo of the same virus type
Infection with measles in the shoreline is the same type of virus as in previous cases in East Savo, reported by THL.
On Thursday, the Virology Laboratory of the Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed that the fifth infection of measles in East Savo is the same as that of previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed by the coastal alm on Friday 28 July is the same type of virus as in previous cases in East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections in East Savo are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may continue to occur after the fifth infirmary until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, "says Mikkaleena Erkkilä, doctor responsible for basic health care infectious diseases.
No new cases of measles infection or suspicion of measles have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Mr Erkkilä points out.
More on: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a lawful scream
They didn't even think about legalizing moonshine soup.
In the background, it is justified that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, alongside alcohol.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing a moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, the moonshine by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that, alongside alcohol, the process produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make the soup of moonshine the right of every man, commented by the Government Advisor, Ismo Tuominen, from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing for the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of pontika was not considered legalisation.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate about the liberalisation of distillation, "says Mr Outi Mäkelä.
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of government parties which took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can't even grant permission to distil a moonshine at home on application.
Commercial manufacturing also remains subject to authorisation.
Importing tells us that the rule for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages at home is simple: alcohol can be produced by visiting the home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make screams at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavouring and flavouring substances and allows the making of screaming, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring substances produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give yourself self-made alcohol as a gift.
You still can't put it on sale.
Scream is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much greater change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will come before the parliament as soon as the fall begins.
The plenary session is on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä is happy.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital with armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital because of a heart attack.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family told me that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced six-fold Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Quotated phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall.
Quotation of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia has leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump invited the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to end his public speech about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto on the fact that he had publicly knocked out the Wall Project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a quote on Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call there was a tight exchange of words.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is' ridiculous', 'terrible' and 'stupid'. Trump said that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like a 'idiot' because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgian massacre: Activists redirected racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the little Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and peeps through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-- -u!" the man is bugging me.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event, fortunately, is just a redesign that was presented on 22 July 2017.
But the sightings of the shock are real when you put a noose on Roger's neck.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to restage the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested in these years, even though murderers live among us, and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help set up the reconstruction.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, reframing is a startling call for action, and it also reminds Monroe residents that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice, and we want to end things at last, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner will cover the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records from the NBC news, over 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the blacks of the State of Georgia were given the first vote by the Supreme Court in the Presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April and the elections took place in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the election where a black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in the city that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting her to have a baby.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, made bail on 25 July 1946 for Malcom's $600 bail, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks will be more concise.
"It was a right-of-vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of today.
It's hard to watch a show, but it's harder not to watch what Greene says is meant to be.
"We do not want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's performance began in June. On the first day about 30 actors - a dozen black and twenty white - gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh works as Green's assistant director.
He has been playing the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the redesign for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," says Marbaugh.
"However, it is important that this side of history is also displayed so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom is screaming and pushing Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?" I said, "Get off my land, n-- -u!"
Rascona, Hester.
And then we're gonna hit him.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit him too hard?" he says.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the white people used the word n-- -u at the time."
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene begins from the beginning.
Now the words of Rascona are fluttering.
No one's laughing.
The reenactment ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress is standing next to the bodies and singing the Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half is white.
There's a couple here to see a show about Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
They've been following Brooks' guidance to the graves of the victims in the pressurizing humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned out to be true, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the sing, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and unmoved bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mumbling to remind himself of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will be thanking the audience.
The actors who cast lynchists take off their cloak and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh, the man who played local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman involved in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason. "
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a dinner together.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta will discuss the presentation with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words when she describes the feelings that the show has aroused.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible things that are said and done by people who look like you - precisely because they look like you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynching still happens," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Mr Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for those who sit at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Recruitment is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
Picking up plants in shops is a real shock: This is what it really saves by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove cauliflower leaves from the store before weighing?
What about taking out the big hat part from the pineapple - it weighs a lot?
Answers give out their opinions strongly: for one, it is an indication of the most extreme nudity that has been exported, for others, it does not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go home to the trash.
The phenomenon will be identified in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki, because many people tear the leaf parts of cauliflower out, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the bio-waste from the store.
According to the news from the financial reports, the sniffing on the vegetable counter is astonishing to the merchants.
But how much vegetable excess removal before weighing really saves money?
How significant is this really about sniffing?
We women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower leaves or strains are taken away.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower, which cost EUR 2.10, was EUR 1.80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: the price of an entire pineapple of EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted off.
Globe artichokes: EUR 2.60 came from EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two delicacies cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost EUR 1 and without heel 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains go off, save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a brassier signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the rules of the league, the buying society cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player himself has to buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives, who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to the new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will examine the details
In addition, Barcelona stated in its press release that it would provide information on the payment to Uefa of the European Football Union, so that it could determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG is violating the rules of Uefa's economic fair play through its spending of money.
Uefa can penalise a company that loses more than EUR 30 million over three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic section.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with significant sums, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qatar Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar.
Austin, 21, sustained severe burns from the lightning strike. The flash was recorded in the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on a plane at South West Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers, when suddenly a flash hit the plane from the rain sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane's wing near Dunn into the ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, "Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on-site at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether or not to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revitalizes business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it launched a new restructuring programme in response to the pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by GBP 300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme to revive the business that was weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House publishing house to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged, with a turnover increase of one per cent in the first half of the year, amounting to GBP 2.05 billion.
The attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and according to the authorities, NATO soldier was killed and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians also died in the attack on Kabul Qarabagh territory.
The explosion is the last violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in the Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan military patrol was attacked by a "self-inflicted explosive device '.
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area mainly populated by shiiamuslimes.
The Taliban announced that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in the bombing in the centre of Kabul, which was the country's most devastating attack by a militant group since the uprising of the Taliban by US-led troops in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to the country to assist the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA runs its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took the decision to delay the implementation of the decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce smoke emissions on the day after the 15 states had sued the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone definitions" of 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Mr Pruitt in the opinion of the Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions for one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, smoke pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution reduction is required in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency sued 15 states, mainly ruled by democrats, including the District of Columbia, according to which postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, are part of a broader programme of economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhalation of ozone-containing air "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person from Isis' leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects indicate that the bomb was to be taken on the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company was cut off.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxic colourless gas-emitting device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public means of transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phelan, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his questioning will continue.
Liquid Managing Director: Renewable fuels did well
The result of the oil refiner Neste before tax fell but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the business profit development of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year's comparable operating profit was improved by US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of the renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, "said Lievonen in the newsletter.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will discuss a possible match at their first meeting.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of under 66.7 kilos, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports station in Los Angeles until WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the master of the upper feather series of WBO.
On Saturday, Garcia won at Showtime by unanimous decision of the former four weight-class world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the list comparing the fighters of the various weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Good luck with the fight! "
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7: 00 on Saturday.
When the twin posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of sizes."
"I'm an ex-featherman," Garcia reminded me.
"I went up to the set [63.5 kilos] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the light show.
He has to go up to the light series [61.2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's do what they want. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on the pay-per-view channel, as part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut the light series later this year and to fight against Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match. Linares and Campbell will fight the light show at the Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the pay-per-view channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel offering the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is getting that much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get a deal... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might go to see Saturday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted the boast of Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow." Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout. "
Garcia said he was focused on showing the punch force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was becoming ever stronger.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely in on this case, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was waiting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight. "
Average salary 5 300 euros, training whatever happens - investment advice status has been "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The last time Helsinki Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the banking business's investment advice spoke a full story when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and different sales of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
These tensions are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that persons employed in an investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for an APV investment degree for a company called Oy, whose qualification group consists of experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
Qualifications range from 12 to 15 credits and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE (Aalto University Executive Education Oy), which provides management development services.
Its website shows that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The educational material includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment degrees, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70.
Of the personnel of the largest banks, almost all providers of investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller banking shops without mentioning the names, whose staff seems to have been avoiding the completion of their qualifications, says Savikko.
According to him, there are "a few" such bankers.
According to Saviko, between 13 000 and 14 000 people have completed the APV1 qualification since 2000 and about 3 000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.
Some bankers consider the completion of a degree to be an advantage.
A number of other industries have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV qualifications, because it is then that investment-related skills are guaranteed.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros a month, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners on regular working hours are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men on missions earn good EUR 5 900 per month and women over EUR 4 500.
On average, the ten who earn the most is worth about EUR 8 100.
The decile of the most earning men earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the most earning women earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Until now, self-regulation has been trusted at the level of employees and tasks.
According to Fiva, the verification carried out by the Commission met individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were insufficient on the basis of the activity of the adviser.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if skills and qualifications are low.
In principle, the situation in this regard has been wild and free.
Several other industries have much stricter skills requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II.
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
For its part, financial supervision is given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi explains that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the legislation on the skills and experience of investment advisors and investment product vendors.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms themselves and to tied agents selling products on behalf of a firm.
The Court tells us that according to a proposal from the Board of Directors from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is given the authority to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided with this view during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, follow-up and further training.
All of this has to be documented and the company has a duty to demonstrate that it has done so.
The Court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map out the staff posts at individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of demand depending on whether this is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is inadequate.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee has to work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, the change will make the rules more stringent and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of 2018.
Picture: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drew" a giant plane on top of the United States
The route the plane flew was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday on 787 Dreamliner aircraft, with which Boeing tested the durability of the aeroplane's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
During 18 hours and 1 minute, a plane from Seattle flew 15 700 km, which is longer than any permanent commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the limits of the United States all the way.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's persistent beach school children will not be stirred up by rain or sun roasting - Iines Emukonen polski tensively with the help of a swimming pool
Iines Elukonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Crying followed.
Imatra beach schools run on Lietta and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes, and then it shines again, young swimmers are not in the mood, says Taina Itkonen, the driver of the swimming schools.
In this week's swimming schools, 13 children will increase their bathing skills, 10 next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the squadron were already starting at that time.
The Imatra beach farm school is co-organised by the "Sport United Project" and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere on the beach of Liette.
The sun was shining, and the young bathers were training to stay afloat with the swimmers, someone without them.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Of all things, 5, the first thought was going deeper into the water.
But Taina Itkonen encouraged her to paddle towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Elukonen told me that she had been swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the beach is a good one.
In all ways, Vili Huhtunen, 5, practiced swimming with a swimming stick.
You'll be pleased with today's achievements, too.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted to fight water wars.
Ilona Villberg, whose daughter Anna Villberg, 6, followed by swimming from the beach, sees the beach school as a good starting point for learning how to swim.
As much as the weather has been, Anna has always liked to go here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Bathing school kids packed up at the pier.
The boys had a lot to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the dock, snapped fruit and fried the day.
There was still a lesson in water, but there was no rush on the dock.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "Here's a unifying story."
You can see all kinds of things.
A couple of days ago, a blue product manufacturing cleaning products launched an unknown soldier product series.
I mean, dishbrushes and laundry racks, and a toilet brush with an edge brush.
An unknown soldier refers to a movie and marketing his premiere this fall.
However, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been taken off in social media: When will the unidentified health ties come?
I have to call the company and see what this is all about.
What does the Vice President of the Blue Product say, Aino Koittä?
We're partners in the movie.
We are here to support this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and the cult film, "Vuitta says.
According to him, the products will be put on a special display and the film will therefore be visible.
Isn't there something funny about this... often when you think that products and the stories that are attached to them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Hainta.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values as those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to military culture either, Soitta points out.
Other partners of the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall's vichys, which are known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced into the market.
Unknown products were already registered by Finnish Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Mr Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time to go on.
For example, Valio, Refiner, Neste and the German retail supply chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products.
The results of the new age tests for Swedish asylum seekers were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been made public. The results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of the tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests will allow for a more detailed assessment of the age of the asylum seeker, which was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Office was criticised for having failed to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Office of Immigration has so far commissioned 6 880 tests, and the Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July in 2017.
Of the 80% tested, i.e. 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age and, in 25 cases, the Agency determined that the tested person was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18 '.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age declared by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Justice Department says that the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences in previous months' statistics," he told the Local magazine.
Although a large majority of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "indications that the investigation was 18 years old or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it appeared that 243 cases had been openly reported by the applicant as having reached the age of 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints, then dentists and radiologists analyse the images.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinist Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot be sure of age, we should not pretend that we can do it, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Mr Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test is almost 18 years old and the risk is about 10%. "
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results during the third round spent the 30 Mikko Ilonen scores down in the golf course in Scotland.
Ilonen left position 11 on Saturday, but was found at the end of the round sharing position 41.
In a difficult weather, a double bog gathered with three bogs.
Other people had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, stood up to share the lead in a one-under-par round, even though he told me there was enough work to keep the umbrella.
The language was brutal, but I hung along and eventually the day was good, Poulter's opinion.
He shares the lead with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodd.
The Governor of West Virginia is changing parties
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he was changing parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as Governor of the Democrats."
The crowd broke out in a bunch of flimsy applause.
"As a member of the registered Republican Party tomorrow," Justice added.
"As coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement stating that "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than a better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Justice Declaration is the last setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC representative Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to the CBS news.
Lightning sown damage - from Thursday to even summer's very thunderous day
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
Over the past week, the country's central and northern regions and the region of Varsinais-Suomi have been swamped.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes set fire to several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the worst thunderstorm of the summer to date.
Thunder deaf people have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, lightning has been used especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the table, lightning struck the power center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a fire call about 15 minutes after midnight on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna room at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department unloaded the roof and the wall to find the fire bags and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of 11 apartments were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
In Loimaa, the lightning set fire to the outer building before midnight on the Harjumaa road.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already at full stage of the fire and the rescue service could only prevent the spread of the fire.
A building about 50 square meters in size burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, again, lightning struck the home house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department came by to check on the case, but this time the lightning couldn't make a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between the Seinäjoki river and Vaasa, when lightning struck the traffic control system.
The information on the defect was received on Thursday morning between 8: 00 and 9: 00, after which the trains in that period were replaced by buses.
It was only just before 5: 00 in the afternoon that the problem was resolved.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally also on a line run by thunder.
The lightning has sown destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer's thunderstorm stories have been completely incapacitated! estimates Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, the Finnish Meteorologist, is on duty at the Meteorologist's Department of Meteorology.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small lightning salon of the summer, many of them feel even strong.
This might feel like a really hard old man, but that's what it's been like compared to the old guys this summer, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the landslides flattened 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even on the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 16: 00, there were 1,790 landslides in the poster.
If lightning continues at the beginning of the evening, we can reach more than two thousand lightning lightning, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak year of thunder was experienced in 2015, when the number of flashes of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's flash rate had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So what is still to be done is to ensure that this year does not break the 'record' two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovisen, the air above Finland will also remain warm and moist during the rest of the week, which is a natural environment suitable for thunderstorms.
The main focus of thunderstorms is expected to be on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2 000 days of lightning can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is a much more uniform sadder course for the central parts of the country.
That's what Tuovisen says you only get a few thunderstorms.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world's head of sport, Sebastian Coe, praised the apology he described as being open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but he added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia's ban on participation.
The Russian head of sport, Dmitri Shljahtin, said at the IAEA Congress on Thursday, on the eve of the World Cup, that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were robbed of the gold or silver medal at the races."
Despite his comment, the IAEA Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from the competition for general sports in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report had presented evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct; it was a very open-minded presentation," said the President of the IAEA, Coe, who told the journalists.
"The Council and Congress as a whole welcomed the fact that the Russian USSR acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for concluding the ban.
"I think we have had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that now is not the time to put an end to the Russian ban," said Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to bring the situation back to normal.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of neutral athlete in the World Championships of Universal Sports starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAEA.
Mr Andersen, Head of the IAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet a number of requirements before its status can be restored.
"There is still insufficient testing, and coaches who have been banned will continue to operate freely," he informed journalists Friday after his presentation to the IAEA Council in London.
Production company disappointed in Tom of Finland's weak success
Tom of Finland did not become the success that the authors wanted, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to acknowledge that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle, CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is the film budget, compared to around EUR 5 million, a little.
It's not a lottery ticket, but it's important now that investors get their money back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have had their money by now.
Now we have to wait for little streams of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff says.

How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona to Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever made by football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, the European football regulator, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the financial rules for a fair game, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona to conclude the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary for the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and connecting him to its star guard, as it will be followed by a family of rulers rich in Qatar's oil.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums to raise players, but they need to be balanced with real income sources so that the football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman elected in 2007 to chair UEFA.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game's financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the first business model that Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of money to buy players and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the fair game economic rules will run until 2018 and will allow clubs to make up to EUR 30 million in losses.
Although Platini had to leave the UEFA Presidency in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of his clubs.
"Fair game rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of fair play at UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract on a one-off basis, it may subtract the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Since Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recognised as an annual cost of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
The first sanctions were distributed in 2014 on the basis of fair game financial rules. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its team of Champions to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its economic regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was excessive.
It has also become apparent that part of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by contributions from the Qatar World Cup Organisation Commission in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Organisational Commission have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to the PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA will follow more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources that were aware of the situation told us on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542,4 million and operating profit to more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it more difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear case of economic doping, both for the club and for the state," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state financing the activities of the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American athlete.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the government owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of a fair game. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state. "
We are in a hurry: Finnish World Championships coach stuck in Helsinki
The height jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the trident Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although he should be coaching in the World Cup in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow for a long jump and Mäkelä for a three-way race on Saturday.
However, the twin coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for Great Britain.
Mr Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British Embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation to the World Cup organisers as a documentary document, but it has also not been eligible for a visa.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or not, coach Jorma Kempäinen said.
He has always been successful in visa matters himself in the past, but there are some problems now.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone looks at the footsteps at the stadium, Arthur Pajulahti said that his coach might be missing.
The World Cup Medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Championships in general sport start today in London on Friday and last a fair week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Universal sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sport that Finnish bench athletes can take passionately year after year, whether or not they are successful.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value contest to another, where experience is used to mature the performance of the athlete to the extent that the adult World Cup Medal is truly possible.
Now, there are no such young athletes on the small Finnish World Cup team, although there are no clichés.
The World Cup Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising nature of sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glue them to watch the races, even though the London medals are not solved until late in the evening due to the time difference.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Cup in general sport in 2015.
It was brought by a spear-thrower named Tero Pitkämäki.
The daring ones are waiting for the Long Mountain medal now, even though the results of his recent and other shooters and the fact that the Long Mountain has been suspended in the last summer's prestige.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkäki will be in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition or make a record of your own is good enough for other Finnish athletes in the race.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish general sport in the coming years will be a great success in the international prestige of young people this summer.
The processing of young talent and financial support for its work are more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative mourners.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will be in the history of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of, for example, terror or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air, "But I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in United States Colorado.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi gathered 147 points in the race.
He tried his last jump at the caballerical 1080 for the first time in the races, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good, and I feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite so well.
Yeah, I'm gonna try it again from now on in the races, you know, in Rukajärvi.
At the big air snowboarding, a competitor jumps out of a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line's new high-speed ship stalled in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new high-speed vessel FSTR is very late on schedule.
The Pika ship was supposed to leave Helsinki at 6: 00 p.m. in Tallinn.
There was a loading operation on the ship around 8: 00.
The ship came to Helsinki late already.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on that ship.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, John Rebane, waiting at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there was a technical malfunction on the new ship.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles to the ship for those waiting for access to their cars.
The Viking Communications Manager, Christa Grönlund, says to IS that there was a technical flaw on the board.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for Tallinn's return trip for a few hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn at 8: 15 p.m. to go back to Helsinki.
A 42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Route 6 on Thursday night

The police are controlling traffic on Route 6, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
The transport from Mälkiä to the port of Mustola is moving along road 13.
Small circuit nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
Both the days of the '80s and the' 90s grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the brilliant "State" sketsister for MTV) and their own time - 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memoir that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived a long time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (among other things, it told the background story of a vegetable can speaking with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the craving teens approaching maturity. To highlight it makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, Stalker movies of the '90s, such as the horror movie The Hand that rocks the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters is digging up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's this crazy scheme that involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (who plays aptly Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see young Paul Rudd, who has a razor under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "Soul patch" from Singles. Rudd's play, Andy, the king of the camp, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random insanity may raise this series as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series relies on another kind of nostalgia: the spirit of the Cold War in the American series, the Atomic Blonde movie and even the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a Bucharest cop partner fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the majority, the tough-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosefin are seen as Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a group of famous vocal actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in the imitation of clumsy socialist drama - there is, for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, which is why the show often starts to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series could act better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can make everything a commodity and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devour our own recent history and their history as a numb.
On Saturday, Toni Tauru from Kouvola will rise into the ring in Macau, facing a former UFC fighter.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru, in Macao, is facing a hard bone, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and the World Champion of the Species.
For once, I'm fighting myself against a parent.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
Kouvola was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were received in the short-term in the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macao.
The Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been set for the fight.
Waiting for the week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer doesn't work because it won't improve in a week.
It could get worse if you practice too much now.
In the last few battles, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the fight.
This time, things are different.
The father of the Kouvolan describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet in the first round he comes on hard and tries to take you to the carpet.
He's won the jujitsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The Kouvolan's last match didn't go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Belington hit Tauru hard in the eye, and the Philippines won.
I've never fought so well, especially when I was standing up: he didn't get a single hit.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It's been a real shame for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some of them get into the ring more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
The Tauru had three matches last year.
This is the second battle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
I've been working out in the last few years and I've been in good shape all along.
But all I've fought for is fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was in Espoo training, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good practice with a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Koovolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
We have to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take it to the property myself.
You can't give your underpants free of charge, because they consume the most.
Macao attracts a Tauru in China before.
They say it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a big night ahead of us. I think it's a great night.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been abrupt and the reduction in inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, and the Bank has shifted interest rates as the income level of families is under increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the income level of households would be under increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to contain inflation driven by Brexit, and the Bank has announced that the cost of the loan may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide low-cost funding to banks in the form of a total of GBP 15 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "According to the projections of the Monetary Policy Commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as household real income decreases in consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" rather than "market expectations."
The market currently forecasts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual 'and" limited'.
In May, the Bank forecast an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and was EUR 1.31 per cent. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11 per cent.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates dampened the expectations of rising interest rates, which grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
According to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even further before it becomes better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" losses in revenue over the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year projection period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will reverse some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the EU referendum in shock, which pushed the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision by the Central Bank, interest rate increases had started to be demanded more and more loudly as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three policy-makers calling for an interest rate increase of 0.5% in July.
According to the Bank, inflation decreased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its target level of 2% was due to a "total 'poor weight.
"In view of the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be becoming even tighter as creditors are feverish in seeking customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no cost-free options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Since September, patients may be prescribed a "reverse 'anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded the dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial, and it has been shown that pre-intercourse medicinal products reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year, which allows NHS to pay for PrEP, even though it claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
The UK NHS Director Simon Stevens called the decision announced on Thursday "significant new intervention," and was described by the National AIDS Organisation as "a crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registration for an experiment that will extend to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection before sexual intercourse.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in at-risk groups.
The medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection during sexual intercourse.
You can take your medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target treatment group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible candidates for the trial for men, women and transgender as well as for those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and reporting to a general practitioner can also apply for an experiment in their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and England's NHS signed a procurement contract for medicinal products after an international tender this week.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, administration and treatment.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"That yet another remarkable achievement in the struggle over 30 years to resolve the major health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If preEP is correctly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it can have a pivotal effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those at risk will receive a drug from the NHS-funded experiment that they will be able to decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have a powerful effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This is welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The test drug PrEP has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that lasted for several months in vain because of the government's slow-down," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a pivotal effect on the work we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been stopped. "
Quality of life: an intermediate layer and smart decor solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Former banker Joanne Leigh, who was interested in building renovation, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to this apartment show, and I noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment back then.
I fell in love right away and made an offer the same day. "
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a twin where the bedroom was only accessible from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer so that the height of the room could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands, "he says.
He was hired by the Duck & Shed design office in Erfan Azad Notting Hill. Erfan was given the task of exploiting the space of almost four meters high rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer that could fit in.
The solution required a creative thought from Erfan.
"Steel structures are pretty complicated.
They had to be arranged in such a way that they didn't need to be cooped up.
The structures had to be adapted so that the height was just right above and below them. "
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms together with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the copper-cross window of Retrouvius opens in an elegant living space.
Mirror furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrics, space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window from which you can view another room.
Entrance mirror-faced furniture has a storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
It's more classy to hide the kitchen when you don't use it.
Kitchen with folding door is not a new solution.
But it's unique in Joanne's kitchen that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took some planning," Erfan says about the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifted."
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage room, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and a better bottom solution.
"When you sell an apartment, it's the area that counts or the property value," Erfan says.
"In a basic case, a real estate agent walks into an apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the premises.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one attaches to electrical wires that run through the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way. "
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additional organisms can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look.
Princess Sofia's dress selection hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
For the dinner of the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Swedish Princess Sofia has visited Swedish Båstad this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented the "A Sustainable Tomorrow" seminar in an amazing blue body-suit that dressed beautifully on its last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia will represent before she is born.
His calculated time is September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed wonderfully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastellini blue was a great dress for the princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden, this week on a mission.
Sofia filled her costume with a small bag.
Sofia was just radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia got excited at the event even to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
She's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a home appeared at the Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
The Lahites were afraid to taste, but they walked by.
In the booth, Panya Suamsri-Penttilla sold food, among friends of Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at that time.
Because the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tasting.
This is how he taught the Gulf to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the ground, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai food store in Lahti.
It had two small tables. I think there were less than 20 clients.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
You can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger when you're hungry and places are limited.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning from Thai.
Two years went by the mall, but then the restaurant had to move, because they said they smelled too much of the spice paste they made themselves in the hall.
There was a new place at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we humpbacks are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times will we have to be shy to ask our guests if there is room next to us.
The bank knows their clients.
They tell him where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customers' life stages vary and the food company changes.
He remembers what kind of man I went out with to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me skinny and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own seat next to the kitchen door and switch with Panja, who's leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing he gives us.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has not only opened our taste but our thoughts and our hearts.
Nowadays, many people talk Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's a hard worker.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to the fungus and blueberry.
Last week, there was a secret celebration of two decades of celebration at the restaurant.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any noise or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
In the early part of the year, the security authorities had access to an important list of anti-terrorism activities.
The list contains data from over 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 of the people mentioned on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have become clear.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found a list of terrorist identities and images when they were investigating a terrorist organisation's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their birthdays, invented aliases and information about their country of origin.
The list also contains a list of terrorist specialities.
For example, in the case of a German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list, Abu Assid al-Almani, a German, is the name of the battle.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to join the ranks of Isis.
He's got a suicide bomber written right next to his picture.
There's no more details on what happened to the man.
A total of some 6 000 fighters from Europe have entered the ranks of Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews at the Rescue Department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person under water was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire master of the rescue department of Helsinki, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The scuba diver found him under the surface, "says Estlander.
The rescue department got a call after 4: 30 this afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
From the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mr Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Those present also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
A man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
In total, there were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, "says the fire master on duty.
There are both men and women among the injured.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads around 4: 00 in the afternoon.
The accident occurred when one car turned from behind the warning triangle to the other car, says the fire master on duty.
According to the Rescue Department, there's a 50-mile-an-hour limit in the crossroads.
Brothers fighting over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers are arguing over Victoria's biggest estate empire worth over $500 million, and the dispute relates to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
The former Chairman of the Carlton Football Society and property developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses away from his younger brother Paul in Toorak. The younger brother has taken the dispute over the distribution of real estate and business assets between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The family began to raise property when they bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family started a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The package was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bull, as well as shopping centres in suburban areas.
According to the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the family's carrying force and central figure."
According to the court records, the asset distribution ratio means that Colin owns property worth approximately USD 316 million and Paul owns approximately USD 176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
This case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after a number of mediation attempts.
The brothers are also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, that he blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavit that he would like to find a solution.
"According to our Italian traditions, family matters to me," Colin says in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of jury statements, e-mails and reports. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as by the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, including Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood where Colin started the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started a shop "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the real estate to their sons in peace.
"Luigi often said that he does not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, and Colin said Mark got $10 million and Luke got $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "bitter about the economic conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League Board and best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and in his text he told me that you can't really comment on it because it's being tried in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family's name to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued and said he still hoped that a solution could be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can finally do it.
First one.
According to Poltico, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss does not get in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawson reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, gathered with management staff on his first day of work, he raised a key problem which he intends to solve: he intends to limit the access to information for President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House staff that all the information - both the printed and those heard at the press conferences - must be passed through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If President-designate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media dealt with things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
At the time, Tara Palmer, a journalist from Politico, wrote that "according to six former campaign workers, the management of Trump Twitter is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady flow of praise."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know. Maybe Trump's tweets would have been even crazier without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unsent.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing such a shock.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to run their business by providing Trump with information that supports their views, which may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The current and former employees of Trump say that he can be extremely angry about the newspaper games in which he is criticised - especially if they mention harmful data leaks - and then he must know exactly where the information comes from.
This happened at the end of February when someone miserably gave the president a copy of the news of the GotNews.com website, set up by Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of a number of White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrew them later, and he did not present any concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had begun the case after reading the questions from his staff about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House Staff Secretary, Rob Porter, had "tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants will continue to pursue their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG.
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona was therefore terminated and was free to move to the Parisian Society PSG.
The huge transfer of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar.
The Society is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qatar Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen defeated alcoholism and flight fear by hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
Of the TV series Rose time and clean white sheets, the famous success writer Raija Oranen has just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold their grandmother so in addition to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now, in the spring, the apartment also left.
Out of the old circles of light and sun, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which he has survived.
Even the external essence is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin pills were stopped, they were mood pills.
I got help with alcoholism in my time from hypnosis, which also worked on fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a man, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orange have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in tourism, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama she's always been, finished her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who made a large literary career, only remembers the 44-piece clean white sheets of TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to be the firm of the Fresh Family in the clothing industry when I read the 50th anniversary interview of Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of the seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I was a mannequin, and Orange remembers.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and thesis revealed it, "says Orange.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, has many manuscripts in the work - ideas of hundreds.
The travelers returned across the ditch to the "millionaire alley."
The most wealthy owners of the West Midlands are once again on a log trail with persistent cyclists who managed to cross the ditch the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans near a street called the Millionaire alley in Solihulle.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat needed for the municipality to move. They brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The travelers managed to cross the barrier at a point left unprotected by the path.
The outraged residents have accused the Solhull municipality of "total inability to solve the problem."
The resident who remained anonymous tells us that on Monday night the vagrants came from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing stones at the bystanders.
"The municipality must be hardened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travelers were here in May, then they left, but they came back again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today. "
The resident told us that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the vagabond returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them, and they have even laid a horse in a grazed park."
According to the spokesman of Solohulli Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solohulli Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for evidence to be collected that as many local authorities as possible report disruptive or criminal activities to the police.
It will help to provide an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings. "
The outraged people surrounded the Portuguese crash plane.
In Portugal, men who have been forced to land on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with the death penalty.
At its longest, you can get 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
Yesterday, a small plane flown by men was forced to land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon because of a technical flaw.
At the time of the incident, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran a landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane hit the man who was on the back plane first.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the head of the child, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents weren't hurt.
Those who were on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the accident, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating its ass, told her about the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane weren't injured in a forced landing.
The tragically lost Finnish star once again won the World Cup gold: "Without the accident, I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early on Wednesday morning in Finland's World Cup gold banked slalom in Canada's Big White competition.
The Grand Hamari won the Cross World Cup gold.
All in all, there are already three World Cup titles.
It's a pretty incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was taken care of, with a pretty good heart rate, the telephone-reached Great Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old counter thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to the Grand Hamar, the number of people in the species is increasing.
The whole paralum board thing has grown and evolved so much lately.
The differences are narrowing, and there are many new counters involved.
You always wonder if there's gonna be a black horse in the back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had counted enthusiastically with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take him to the slope.
Well, it does come to mind from time to time that what my life would be like if it weren't for that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in jocking.
With those cards you play what's shared, the Great Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to denounce a serious accident and lose a limb as a kick of luck, and that is not what Big Hamar does.
But he turned a terrible difficulty for his own good.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamar's greatest boating enthusiasm was already fading.
The dun went straight to the top, and it wasn't until after the accident.
I used to train with my friends when I was a kid, and we were always so excited about hitting X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that became somewhat dim over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in that X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to put on my overalls and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty good.
The calculator was very pleased about the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize at the sports gala in January.
According to Great Hamar, winning the Star is an important signal to the barracks.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the world of barbers.
When is it time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's athlete campaign of the year?
We'll see about that in due course.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamar has not yet conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year, there will be a great goal.
A year from now, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their country of origin unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread at refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication office chain, Burson-Marsteller, studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For the past nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24 were responsible for the survey, half of whom were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their country of origin in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents can think of returning to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most effective factor in the permanent return home, while the quarter considered that the most important thing would be the departure of Isis.
Only less than a tenth of the main factors affecting the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority is of the opinion that the end of war is more essential than the renunciation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter considers al-Assad's presidency to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half of them feel that both political and military solutions are needed to put an end to the current conflict in Syria.
It is only a quarter that we believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugees see the power of Isis weakened over the last year, while the fifth feels it has been strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isis, and terrorism in general, is that the media provide people with information that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many have raised military measures and education reform as a priority.
A fair tenth felt that the most important thing would be to create more paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the period of Trump.
There is a division of views on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Espool company MariaDB is developing the "fastest growing 'open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, is not worth anything to users and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology manager of Mariadb, spends about half his time encoding.
A man who works at a distance from a beautiful place makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle left the software to devour Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle shop took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not make a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company which started developing Mariadb.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired 20 of the best developers from Sun to ensure that the continuity of the code is secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the development of MariaDB's code.
"During MySQL, no such confirmation was made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, Chief Financial Officer of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén has little say in the company's figures.
To that extent, he reveals that, for the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive an order of EUR 20 million.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may be more than a year's work if the client has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB can be exchanged in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are the paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in the Linux distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamblers.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé's list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB in terms of turnover are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing sintas.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users pay nothing for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been switched to open databases or a transition would at least have started.
Large companies do not get new customers because most of them choose the open source code next.
This has led to the fact that licence fees for commercial databases have gone high.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers, "Widenius wonders.
As the exchange of closed databases is cumbersome, most of the customer companies have been obedient in their price increases.
"There are a lot of customers to whom it is really difficult to switch because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer dimension is coming to full.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major system changes when transferring their activities to cloud computing services.
At the same time, a lot of people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest EIB growth finance ever granted to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in, for example, the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros a year for databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is spent in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
The community helps and does things that can't be invented or done by themselves.
The 55-year-old Widenius is among the most well-known promoters of open source code, Linus Torvalds, another Finnish developer of Linux.
Widenius helps other companies to develop operational business models over open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy hardens its attitude towards non-governmental rescue ships
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations on their ships to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they commit themselves to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to a new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Mr Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the German Jugend Retet aid vessel, whose crew was suspected to have cooperated with human smugglers, which contributed to illegal immigration.
Only for a year did the aid organisation refuse to comment on the detailed charges against the prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We very much regret that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in a statement published in the social media.
"We will only be able to judge the accusations when we have gathered all the necessary information and we will be able to assess the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Retet.
It is suspected that the crew had gradually taken on board refugees directly from human smugglers who had re-used the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, as it appears from a document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area, and is considered motivated by the enthusiasm for help.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who controls the operation.
Only three out of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS as well as the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they did not entail "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to comply with the Code of Conduct are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Mr Minniti, for his part, stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy had fallen sharply over the past few weeks, as he saw as evidence that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors were beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, the light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He revealed that this month plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of killing his cohabiting partner at Enontekio, a suspect was found in the terrain, a case for the prosecution.
The suspected crime was committed in Enontekiö Kutta last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also informed us that, after what they did, the suspect would have fled into the country with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he didn't make any resistance when he was caught.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be pending in the Lapland District Court during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and all my hairy friends, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy is dead at 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, began her acting career at the theater at 24.
During his long career, he also played in films and on television.
Hardy is remembered in particular for the role of the Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter movies and for her role as a vet in a series based on James Herriot's book "All-Furry Friends."
The BBC's popular series was filmed for seven seasons in total.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texting about suicide.
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and calling to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, carries out 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the judgment and was able to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, listened to the hands of his sentence cross-eyed, weeping eyes created on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He hasn't taken responsibility for the act, "the prosecution continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the case was caused by "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, telling her that "it won't take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I get through all this. I will do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear. "
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that he was "persecuted" by the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born." Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter in his text messages had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinion of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: The worst in Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to prevent the situation from escalating and a new cold war.
Prior to Mr Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the USA and Russia had even gone to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the Congress on bad relations between the countries, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a setback from car manufacturers.
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of over 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said that the company believed that "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions'. He referred to European cities, including BMW's home town, Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a return invitation.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installation of emission-neutralizing devices is increasing, making it difficult for cars to be priced competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of being sympathetic to the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies try to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed trickery devices in the cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in the tests. In normal driving the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Director of thermodynamics in the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in their cars to circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The vote in Venezuela started a fraud investigation, major demonstrations on the agenda
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election results, Mr Tibisay Lucenan, Chairman of the National Election Commission, said to journalists.
Maduro says the crisis will end.
On Sunday, a controversial vote was taken in Venezuela to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces began to take over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the region of Provence in southern France, but it is now under threat of climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is directly at risk in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear reduction in the rainfall of spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute in Provence, which specialises in agriculture.
"This will shorten the lifespan of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cascades into the area that spread microbacteria. "
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired fragrance and cosmetics ingredient.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water. In addition, more resistant varieties of drought are developed.
The murder of a reporter is a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of Riodoce, which is published once a week, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how to deal with the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or including them in a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalet board at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group, no evidence needed, no observations, no knowledge.
The table contains the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the chaos in Mexico a life-threatening issue.
According to the journalists' protection committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote one of his many books on drug violence.
The picture says, "Justice." The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a panamarised brand.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and the reporters will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor's Office was set up to deal with journalists' cases in particular, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
Journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of drug-related and organised crime-related murders each year end up in court.
Riodoce journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the state capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a few blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot 12 shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the newspaper: Riodoce means 12 rivers.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to grieve with a wife and two grown children.
Rumors move fast and free in Culiacan.
However, we are silent about Valdez's death.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and there are two-storey funeral homes with drug barons that are bigger than many homes.
In the coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a rival group that is at war with the Guzman boys.
The case may have pissed off the Guzman boys: the clients suspected of being members of the gang bought every number of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the sales points.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many, his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The magazine's shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the newspaper became familiar with its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the newspaper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after he was founded, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for his news in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Committee of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without hesitation.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when he received the award of the press protection committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, "said Valdez in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The reporter must accept a mission that falls upon him..." or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why didn't I tell you what was going on? "
Riodoce's staff needs Valdez, a joker who cursed like a dock worker, and they need a friend who always got a hug and advice, and they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panamatta.
He went to a bar across the street from El Guayabo, and he was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how best they can do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals will not like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug runways.
They were left out, "Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trust in your own instincts.
If you feel things aren't right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodoce's reporter, Andres Villarroal, that "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
The mobile phones were not allowed into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier it had become clear that only spy programs sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for cover of the tree from 40 degrees of heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the reporters were half-guessing whether these two cops were part of the 50% that the governor of the state didn't think was reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's number, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
The size of boxing Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending had focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the DA's office, was a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI). The PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the abduction from Valdez's column.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who, because of his bodily structure, has received the nickname "El Flaco," Thuukainen.
"Now all communications with our sources are down."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are stored. The workers of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took with him a few signs the next morning, leaving the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration due to another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adade disappeared in the Western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations, SOS Press texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for the Valdez case investigation.
On the day after the Valdez murder, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked for him to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, criminal authorities and an indifferent society.
In its last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, over half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a message from the Zetas cartel at his body, saying, "I'm here for my writing."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state, following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their states or from the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and we must be vigilant at all times.
Sometimes criminals find the journalist, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet at one time, admits that writing about the drug trade scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's suppliers sat on the pavement at midnight on Friday, with a beer at the front of their delivery, after the latest edition of the paper had been completed. Suddenly their phones began to colour as a sign of the message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
I had to redo the front page the next day.
The sirens howling in the vicinity... another shooting scene.
Bojorquez took a look at the officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the newspaper under this massive portrait where the man shows the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about shutting down. "How could I close the paper when our intern asked me to go out on the street and do a story the day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Hard Place"
In April, Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, missed a short party because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began in a catastrophic way when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May was practically all over when he got sick.
First there was the flu, and then there was the disease of the baby like an ear infection, which I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the internship, Manninen tells the evening-saying.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a traineeship permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHH Competition and Top Sports Research Centre's rolling test on 12 June.
In the test, an athlete skates with roller skates on a carpet whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the tip of the athlete's finger with a needle.
Last fall, I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I'm only 28 minutes.
The wall came up, Manninen says.
To a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells me that she was healthy.
I've done a wide range of peaceful aerobics exercises to try to normalise the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week period behind us.
Midsummer was also a week and a half from flying.
My family and I have plenty of time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen as soon as Manninen got up on top skiing 18.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
Now we're looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a three-World Cup weekend.
In December, it would be at least one weekend at the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team's list, "says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympic Games would be the sixth winter Olympic Games of Mannise's career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002, the gold team competition celebrated the moor underline.
Dinosaurus protected himself from his enemies by camouflage
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It was preserved so well that scientists were even able to define that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had a "troubled past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the mid-term stages of the accession period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a very significant discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's royal paleontology museum.
There, for six years, the beast was dug out of a 100-kilo boulder.
The results of the hard work are now available.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin studies found that dinosaurs eating meat were probably a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and looked like a walking tank.
Its red and white armour disguised it from predators and was also protected by a darker and lighter colour, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus entered the headlines in May and is now on display in the Royal Paleontology Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealope Markmitchelli according to museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine the pattern and shape of its body scales and armor.
They discovered that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring in which the body is darker and lighter from the top.
However, the observation was a surprise because Borealopelta is considerably larger than the present animals with similar coloring.
From that, it can be concluded that the dinosaurs eating meat caught it to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
For example, deer, zebras and armadillo have similar coloring from existing animals, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the chalk season were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the nodosaurus scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists will continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions from its life. Among other things, they will study the contents of its intestine to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted to the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it was today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because its scaly skin has been preserved and has also been preserved in three dimensions in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early membership period
It does not require much imagination: if you squint a little bit of your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep. "
The chalk period was the era of teropod, huge bipeds, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, which is millions of years before Borealpelta, its great predecessors may have hunted this armoured dinosaur.
The predecessor of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope washed up in the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with leather and armor from the nose to the hip.
Nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two half-meters of spikes came out of their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armoured vegetarian passed through the current Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor is preserved even in small details in the underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin remains in the pits of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that this kind of survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The pitting plates of that skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scales of its foot base. "
How did an activist learn to answer the question: who does the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on his Airbnb apartment bed browsing Facebook with his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
He was confused to note that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
In his timeline there were numerous reproductions from the user @ TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. The white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he came back to Twitter later that night, people were told they'd be gathering at Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police shutters and screaming people, and of the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing a sign that said, "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police stood in front of the protestors with a dog barking.
He also says he saw a video of another cop pulling his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It was not the kind of murder that we are already used to and could be said to be typical of.
That's when I felt cold.
I was angry and I cried. "
He booked a flight home for the next day.
Ferrell came to pick up his six-year-old daughter at her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
From what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in almost three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets?" was made. It was premiered at the cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell was driving towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and a crown compatible with it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live in black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't have missed my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow into it.
He must have the capacity for activism and organisation, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of black life, and he must know what we must do to free ourselves.
Although luckily I have been able to protect him from flagrant racism, he is still like any other black girl.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality. "
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is across the street from the police station, and became a camp for activists waiting for information about the case and finally found out that there would be no charges against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunchpackages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to adopt a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he says. When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of a minority nursing student organisation. At that time he focused on the right to food and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience of organization.
Somehow it just happened. "
A week later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell 'what was happening.
Ferrell thought it was suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for this suspicion was the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white people, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan recently told us in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among deathprisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The film crew followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks for us or speaks for us, but we speak for us," Davis says.
"The most important thing to me was how local people are presented in a movie, because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experience because it was intended to show that the people's movement was "not about a charismatic leader, but about a community." Ferrell proved to be more open than the ones described.
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I understand that this work and the human depiction of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats and brings to the centre the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in the social media (# BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept up the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything. "
Folayan agrees: "The movement is actually maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he points out that Ferrell was not selected for the document because of its "self-meaning" queer identity.
"He's got the energy going," Folayan says.
"However, it is no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen. "
The news teams have left Ferguson a long time ago, but there is still a tension between the community and the police.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway in a demonstration.
His description of the social and political climate in his home corners is short and concise: "Mixed mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains. "
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition room with faces - white, black and brown faces, where you can see the resemblance in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples from the cheek and hair of Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison where he served 35 years of sentence. Manning was sentenced to leak classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was reduced by Barack Obama on the third last day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyses Manning's DNA algorithically and creates 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the shape of DNA data, multilingualism and the cause-effect relationships underlying the interpretations, and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has been openly reporting her identity with women since puberty. She was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including violations of the Law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning in prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, where Manning, who was in trouble, is sitting in a car in the driver's seat. He has a platinum blonde wig on his head, which became his symbol.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a very popular Stranger Vision project, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA data from, for example, cigarette butts and chewing gum, and he created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us about the new exhibition at the press conference.
So the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even worked together on the Suppressed Images comic book, which was depicted by Shoili Kanungo, which described the future in which the President would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and allowed her to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a civil military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is at war with data levers and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen those powerful divisors that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has meaning."
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's great signature, where the point of last name i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to the "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based."
On the opposite wall is the Manning DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written on the pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotides, such as the scientific definition used by an artist - Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that the genetic data are very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition will also display his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are displayed here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page of the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's where the Manning character comes out of prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you down, they've won," it says in the picture.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive, I'm still getting chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data as a set of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The face was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring it to the crowd," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind her release."
The professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University are wanted on suspicion of murder.
Police say they launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
The Cook County court records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local press release published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police that were alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incisions in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the stabbing was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for social relations at the University, stated that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University helps with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement from the University and Somerville College spokesman by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are prepared to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he was calling on suspects to surrender seriously to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly specifying our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
He said the police got a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglielmi.
The management team of the Grand Plaza published the following information to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I am not an anti-Muslim, I am a Catholic," the condemned said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
According to the police, they were alerted by bookstore personnel on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was captured when he called the police about threatening him.
Threatening him had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same dress as the suspect in the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police at the interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay a sum of £620, or about €690, and £85, or about €95, for the victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko of Russia has said that Russia will soon complete the road map of WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, in order to restore the powers of RUSADA, the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"Some of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD, the British Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's mandate. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the Mutko, it does not contain anything that concerns Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, "said Mutko.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of the study of Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer appointed by WADA. McLaren is investigating the alleged state contribution to Russian sport doping.
That is what Mutko said: 'The investigation is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we cannot admit something that did not exist. "
In the words of the Mutko there were echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier on the same day to the Russian RSport media, admitted that there have been problems in Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, "he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Mr Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was "on the right path" towards the restoration of powers.
British Association skeptical of Finnish-loved innovation: Health benefits of maternity packaging "no evidence"
The British organisation suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, BBC and Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting against hidden deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of hidden death.
Hidden death means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because that would suggest that we recommend this product, the organisation informed us.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that every family is given a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain, Mrs Bates, President and CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hidden deaths.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it shares meet all the security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best place to sleep if there is no crib or crib available.
The organisation recommends that the packaging should only be used for daydreams and that it should be stopped when the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
A snappy villain ran away from a Japanese zoo twice.
The staff of the Japanese Zoo are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped twice in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, West Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned about Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The runaway 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about three feet long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo hasn't had any eyewitness sightings of a turtle.
The last escape of the villain took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These start-ups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes.
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her online shop's startup company, but the queries did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the workers were sceptical about them.
"The queries were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett explains. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of personnel management start-ups have emerged on the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them on specific teams and groups of the population, provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the board of directors.
"Your health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of Glint-startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers analytics software for companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says that he has had a more profound view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make rapid inquiries and votes for certain teams. It can also draw up a map that shows at one glance which departments the workers are the most dissatisfied and which leaders have the weakest estimates, which has allowed Errett to drill to the heart of the problems.
Businesses have understood that they must follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has surfaced ever since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, can reach more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, the Convercent in the state of Colorado is a start-up that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation hit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives companies the opportunity to conduct tailor-made surveys, collect answers in real time in confidence and map problem areas.
In addition, workers may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if the manager is suspected of being indecent, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"Public opinion has been overthrown by the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Conversent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethical, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene, and consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose workers and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees in 500 locations. The company has used the Convercenter for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, it was a practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out the telephone number or email address that could make the notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Legal Director of Ruby Tuesday. He said that it was difficult to follow complaints from employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive picture of the worker's reality," says Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen, an audit firm, collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that the companies realised that they could no longer prevent the public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the supervision of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity accepted by venture investors, and both Glint and Convercent are supported by venture capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected a total of USD 60 million.
Investments are not surprising given the links between businesses, business culture and risk capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as the Silicon Valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of the LinkedIn company responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors get a return when companies are successful, companies are successful when employees are committed.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen workers' commitment, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of workers' commitment is important,
but it will be useless if no action is taken on that basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if there is no change quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce workers' commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, Director General of Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on simply collecting information.
"If the company fails to take action, employees will start to wonder if they have been consulted.
And do their opinions make any difference?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently carrying out monthly staff surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day that it is announced in Glint.
After Errett had collected feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known as the high turnover of workers.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbor, "says News Office TT.
A woman who lived in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a rope outside her window.
According to her, the camera on her cell phone taped her apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had run into another room to dress up.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but counted shortly thereafter to the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of smuggling has admitted to filming a woman.
But he said he only filmed her face.
The video on the cell phone had been erased and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In the hearings, a man has admitted to an act, but has denied that he has committed a crime.
The man had justified himself by saying that he loved his neighbor "completely insane."
News agency TT says he's gonna be charged with this case.
Teachers demand more cash in the autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than those of the export industry, for example, but should be narrowed, "said OAJ President Olli Luke on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements which do not involve in any way the holiday cuts that have been made.
In the local government sector, contracts are expected only after the private sector documents have been signed and the percentage increases have been established.
Luke predicts that the working conditions of OAJ, for example, have been agreed in January.
Percent targets Luke didn't reveal yet.
Mr Lukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a conference organisation for trained public servants.
Luke: Holiday surgery increases earnings gap
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of employees in the public sector is decreasing, while the purchasing power in the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday allowance cut will further exacerbate the differences in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher should be defined as:
The OAJ also points out that equality of basic education needs to be ensured, as differences between those who do best and those who do not do best are constantly increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and disparities between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of Bruins' players was prolonged as NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one.
It's almost 11: 00 in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of campus's new training fields.
Some have taken off their jerseys, and their backs shine on the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chat is a noon break.
After three hours of practice at the university summer courses, players return to the dorm for final exams. The next morning they meet at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," says Coach Jim Mora of Bruins just before Monday changes for Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was intended to lighten the number of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final final tests will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started at quarter past seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space in the players' already full schedules.
Limiting internship times to one per day means that there are more training days. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the training division of Westwood that has been going on during the six seasons of Mora, while the exercises are taking place at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening match begins: UCLA meets Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says that she supported the NCAA's change of rules, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We will be burdening them very much for three or four days, and that is very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed by football flying over the safety net behind the paint bar.
The Bruins players are due to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora acknowledges that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available from outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises pays quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan. "
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will be held in Central Africa in Rwanda, where the winner is already seen to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing his third term, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting statistics on poverty.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make an effort because the Constitution, which was based on two periods of presidency, has been amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment flows into the country.
Kagame has also played a major role in bringing together a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has been set on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting false news by stepping up the check of facts
Facebook plans to send potential false news more and more to independent factual inspectors and to present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Any false news will be sent to the fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news. Many people believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with false news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the verification of facts will be tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the sidelines of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can make a more informed decision about what they read and share," Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook news feed wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the topic-related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The small Scottish castle in the county of Kent is now known as the Squeezen music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this castle in the charming place in the river valley of Bewl is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says with a tenderness.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of the families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edward Age. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Library.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter had been written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell of smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is there.
I love archives! "
A writer who was attracted to old documents was able to live in a castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Fine Arts in England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not stay in the castle without delay for a little longer than would have been desired.
He spent his days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rainfall, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and discussed with rangers, gardeners and sometimes artists who imagine the book.
At night, he "took whiskey and started writing."
The closer history of Scotty is quite unknown, as the castle did not move entirely to the National Trust until after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation staff were just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
There were journals in the archives, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, here families fought for even one birch.
It occurred to me that we should let it go by now. "
Some of the stories of the book go from castle to English history, like The Labourer. It's about a man who joins the English peasant rebellion shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"Knight Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The English peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion may begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected? "
The other stories of the book are closely linked to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, the story of the priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the reformation of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 1700s. He said he staged his own funeral by filling the casket with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite the brats. They were constantly in debt and buying things they couldn't afford.

You were the worst in Russia since the Cold War.
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could strive for close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to prevent the situation from escalating and a new cold war.
Prior to Mr Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the USA and Russia had even gone to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for thanks to the Congress on bad relations between the countries, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
The longstanding heavyweight world champion Vladimir Klitshko of professional boxing will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him at points in November 2015.
In April of this year Klitshko met Wembley at the stadium Anthony Joshua and disappeared after a fierce match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitshko told me in his press release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I ever dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko's reasons for his decision on the video.
Mr Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitshko, explained in the press release that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating an American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers managed the World Cup titles of various alliances at the same time.
The Finnish weatherman is witching conditions: "Take the vibe"
Minna Nikkanen, the pole jumper, has suffered from the conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her from her.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been against Minna Nikka, the pole jumper this summer.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little sticks to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here for God knows how many times I've never experienced the same variable wind in this place, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurmin in the Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, when even the exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikkanen said in the Kaleva Games.
The weather was on Thursday in London, too.
It's been pretty challenging to get the technology together, is it cold stuck or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's been killing me.
There's no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
He got into the World Cup because of his gray jump 455.
It's gone 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be cool and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday's Qualification 460.
Why don't you just go work out?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump together and I got the tech steady.
I probably should have done the same thing right now.
Normally, you've been able to practice in the hall. Now the hall's closed.
What would it be like to race?
Twenty-five degrees.
A little wind will do, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official bored the politicians in general: "We have no room for division now or for many years."
Despite the positive economic climate, the Juha Sipilä Government must keep ice in its hat and be careful not to increase the state budget with debt money, warning Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing the budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed Retired Virta in Wednesday's First Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
More recently, Mr Virtanen sees the proposals put forward by politicians, such as the withdrawal of a guarantee pension, the calculation of a car tax and the support of electric bikes as electoral speeches.
They are mainly saying that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state's budget is financed by an additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I think it's even a fraud to talk about a division when you take a debt, Virtanen said to General.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Estonia has a long experience of preparing state budgets: in 1978, he started as Secretary of Budget at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of Budget.
Last time he retired, he was chief of staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In the interview with Mr Yle, Mr Virtanen pointed out that the projected growth rate of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All the fortune tellers estimate that this is a thorn from which we will go down next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington changes the rules on permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules on a permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended by means of a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark doesn't want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
This is Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret photographed in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the Court states in its press release on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the Head of Communication of the Court Lene Belleby commented in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried beside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal with his wife.
According to Court, the Queen has long been aware of the wish of her husband's burial place and understands the decision.
Horrible moment on the road: The car almost hit the highway
Both had an unmarried partner and two small children on board.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they don't get the insurance money if they don't get one of them.
The accident occurred at the Cheimo Gate in Vantaa.
An archive from the construction site of Circle III.
The Vantaan Tommi says his family survived a miraculous car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her unmarried partner Riina and the two little children of the couple were driving on the highway at the Kimolanport in Vantaa, in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
The circle III from the entrance to Hämeenlinna was driven along the acceleration lane by a white car that was driving the family car to the side, "says Tommi.
If it wasn't for the evasive action, the car would have gone with Tommy.
I brake and I turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the rail at a high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other is under 1 year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one passed us even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened around 5: 20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at their place, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue department personnel showed up, and the family's condition was checked.
The car was ready for redemption.
Tommi says he and his partner have little income, and they got a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information on the other car, Tommy says the family doesn't get the money from the insurance.
That's why the family wants witnesses to detect the car that drove the family into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to kindergarten and work without it, "says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or the early 2000s.
He thought the license plate of the car started with SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we do it financially, we're gonna have to count every inch of it today.
Tommi hopes that anyone who saw or knew anything about what happened will be in contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they have had an accident mission on Tuesday evening.
The title and article were corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally said, the second car did not come into the reception lane, but was driving from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
A performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relationships by means of humor - The Self-Exhibitor will be seen at what? Theater on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born guidance to what? theatre.
The self-exposer is a performance of music theater about misguided relationships and inadequacy.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it'll still make you feel good about it.
It's a matter of humor.
You don't get to feel bad, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the tour of the summer theatre was carried out with a long-term budget and a large young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what you reveal when you get to know a new person.
Do you think he's playing some role or is he approaching the other one?
It's a ploy to confuse fact and fiction.
The guy has both directed the show and made it dramatic.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal consists of the working group's texts and has no plot.
The director believes that even though the performance draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
He points out that the self-exposer does not directly tell about his own or the working group's human relations.
Fact and fiction get mixed up.
I'm sure my own world of value will be passed on to the show.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I also do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
A lot of people learn from their divorced parents.
Jäppinen believes that the self-exposer is drawing a timely picture of young adults living in Finland, 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned a great deal about relationships with their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka will play.
The working group also includes Ms Ella Snellman, the costumer.
Music atonement is Jupppinen and Roka.
Love for the theatre was ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies as director of theatre expression at the Art Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
There's two years in the back and another one in front of you.
The guy's enthusiasm for the theater has begun over the Kouvolan years.
The teacher of the music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the City Theatre in Turku.
The steering has begun to become more and more interesting.
The exposer himself received his premiere last week in Helsinki on the stage of the Fool.
In the future, a presentation lasting about 45 minutes will also be seen at least in the study town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-exposing Kouvolan What? At the theater on August 4th at 7: 00 and August 5th at 2: 00 and 7: 00.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year - the collar broke.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Rättela.
The Ace of the King's Landing circled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Rättela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, he was also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of physical activity on Earth that the chemist would not have tried once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Rättela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I've been licking wounds at home for a year, "says Rättela.
The bay had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have had a part to play in the accident.
You know, riding a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't use it to get boundaries.
It's just so hard as a species, it's not worth too much for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Rästela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
It was a long time ago as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
As soon as his own career ended in 2006, he started in the nest.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to take my place.
I didn't really do much.
Even during the training period, Rättela often challenged his protégé on the slope and physics tests.
Surprised to say, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired, even my own thoughts didn't make sense.
Not even with the sport.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it because, for once, I was just allowed to be.
The mandatory break inspired Rättela to be the head coach of Finland.
If he didn't stop, he'd be afraid he'd burn out.
It's easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Teltela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the race.
I traded motocross for frisbee golf!
I mean, it just left the patch right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although he has always been a super-eager trainer, he does not insist on his coaches being similar to him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
There's room in our species culture to be our own kind and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in accordance with it, "says Rättela.
The sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry just after it had started to feel like 2017 couldn't get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
"We must start to take seriously the spread of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and the professor of emeritus in robotics and artificial intelligence from the University of Noel Sharkey Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes of the robot, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being rubbed, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and type and color of fingernails.
It is all the more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to user preferences, such as shy.
Roxxxy Gold robots from True Company have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is adapted to the user's personality as fully as possible," is advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, for example, in a chat mood, or "in that mood."
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches, for example, a programmed robot that is shy and resistant.
True Company compares Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where submission is one of the other options.
Of course, most men do not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report shows their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or insulting until the market says so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful image language, such as images of hanged bodies and out-of-sight eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world feels about the series.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There is an attempt to make sex robots as much as technically possible like real women (in terms of porn star proportions).
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements mimic human movements as much as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They don't have their own will or history, or anything that points to independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slave girls.
Police suspect that two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by Isis Chief
The leader of the Extremadura Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of taking the bomb to an aircraft of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person from Isis' leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects indicate that the bomb was to be taken on the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell me exactly why the company was cut off.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxic colourless gas-emitting device and take it to a crowded public place, such as a public means of transport.
The Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phelan, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his questioning will continue.
Trump's good side?
Makes Mitt Romney look like he's got common sense.
In the Trump era, it has already been said, until the end of the day, that families have also been disbanded by the strong division of voters on a daily basis.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspaper advisory board showed how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been the buttons against the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy could have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins are all familiar - including the Republican sibling he's been arguing about politics with for decades - suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that is a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation," we talk about the scary possibility that one day we won't be able to be terrified of his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more appalling possibility that Trump will normalise the Republicans on the right edge, which suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney's contained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and we have seen his tax return).
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be clear-minded, and that feels like a major improvement right now.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel horses are huge, the characters in the middle - the grotesque clowns and the animals that look back in terror - are ominous, and the screaming music behind them is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's hallways are fluttering out over time: the view of high buildings is getting bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the city's reality is not the same as its dreams.
And yet, 35 years later, I have not been completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big traffic circle in Northern London.
The central park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience - even to the extent that two women two years old, one eleven years old and two women in their 40s enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing about the café in my neighborhood, but it also gives me the opportunity to combine 15% of the service money with the estimate when I go myself to get the coffee from the counter.
This slows down the everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The salesman at the department store smiled at me in an unfortunate state when I was tired of giving my credit card five stars to my experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Interi. "There was no trust in the leadership."
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq's club from the role of coach of the representation team.
The responsibility for coaching is assumed by Fabrizio Piccare, who used to be an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue its current tasks.
In the past, the Italian Piccarella has been an assistant coach in, among other things, the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccarella, who joined the Interi coaching group, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FC interi, regrets what has happened.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, which means that there was no other option at this time, Mr Håkans commented in the club's press release.
The Piccareta Agreement will remain in force until the end of the period.
He and the rest of the coaching team will be responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to the evening reports, the team has been raging all Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccare and John Allen have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta joined forces strongly in the inter match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lambenius published a picture of her youth in the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin?
The violin artist Linda Lambenius published a youth picture in Instagram.
A number of hassles have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lambenius himself wonders about a young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can take a look at it here.
Lambenius has published pictures of his past before and has also spoken about painful subjects.
A fair year ago, he published a set of pictures of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture, he's seen 20 years ago, in the second, he's posing now as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lambenius contemplates his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lambenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtag life, eating disorder, insecure, confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lambenius has spoken openly about his eating bulls in previous years.
She was already in the hospital at 14 because of anorexia and orthodoxy.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was finally discovered only in 2006.
The healing started gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lambenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pains.
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for cuts on his wrists, which according to the prison authorities he received after he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original death sentence by the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp's Valentine's Day in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who was hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too lenient.
The Prosecutor of the State intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarian people were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally encamped Bulgarian citizens were arrested in Greece, announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the bTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, and there were two Bulgarian members of the camp.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarian people.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those camping in areas other than those reserved for this purpose.
The inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like digestive system nightmares.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritated bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
People suffering from irritated bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, scientists at Washington University found that protein-containing essential amino acid tryptophan helps the body develop immune cells that enhance intestinal tolerance.
According to research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the bowel and make sure the harmful microbes in the food don't get into the body.
Inflammation cells are balanced by cells that enhance tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, it may result in irritated bowel syndrome.
In studies, immune cells that confirm tolerance were found in mice with specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to start the immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building elements of proteins.
"We detected a connection between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbiology," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan was found in the mouse diet, the more immune cells were present."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuterus bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
In the study of immune cells that enhance tolerance, the investigator, Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same species of mice that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiotics of the mouse intestine, i.e. the normal bacterial, fungal and viral community in the gastrointestinal tract.
When mouse intestinal DNA was tested, six bacterial species were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that had no intestinal microbiography and did not develop immune cells in a sterile environment, they started to develop immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, grow Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transfer small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells evolved into cells that enhance tolerance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice 'food, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50%. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri can make cells develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritant bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their spread. '
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" after making a deal with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfield player debuted Manchester United in a row match against Sampedoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-Unite match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defending midfield player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic was not yet in the best condition, however, because he was not on the tour of blue shirts in Asia before the beginning of the season. He only managed for 45 minutes in the field - Mourinho said that there must be a change before the beginning of the election league.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius - he has a natural ability to think football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to cool off his starting set for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has given priority to.
"Three out of four - we must thank the company," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
The volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost its fourth World Cup match to Germany directly in series 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routines are high.
Even their game was in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi told in the press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland held its opponent tight, but in the third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, so we could swing along, Kangasniemi said.
Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points, was the most effective in Finland.
Three games out of four lost Finland will still meet on Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Trump Jr.
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for his ties with the Kremlin.
This is the story of Reuters, the news agency, which at the same time confirms the information published earlier on Thursday by the Wall Street Journal about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Veselnitskaya, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, the current advisor to the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington represents an intensification of the pace of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation into Russia's involvement in the presidential elections in the United States and whether the Trump campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will consider the evidence that the prosecution has investigated and decide whether or not to press charges.
A British inventor microchip himself to get into his home and his car with a swing of his hand.
The British inventor is the first person in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car by waving his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchips in cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also converts the locks of houses and cars into compatible with the microchip.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The last month's decision by the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the south lawn of the White House for an American production demonstration cost taxpayers 24 000 dollars.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the President is on board. It was a attraction at the event at the White House on 17 July 2017, where American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials have been looking at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, as shown in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you are aware of this, because it is an exceptional event that will gain a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote the day before the event in an e-mail to his commander, the deputy commander of the Navy flight.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17: 7 in the morning and the event would start at 3: 00 in the afternoon. The helicopter would only leave after the lawn was cleared between 6: 00 and 9: 00 in the evening.
In addition, the message mentioned that if a helicopter were delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be required to be present due to the restrictions on service periods.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME whether another crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 was asking if the incident was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you can attend," the Deputy Commandant replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the health reform that was discussed at that time in the Senate, as well as of less restrictive state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their travels,
but it is unusual to use them only for photos.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented American workers' products made from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, Press Secretary of the White House.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House within centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America included a monthly training quota for the crew.
On that day, the unit's helicopters also operated 11 hours of "non-presidential support."
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman told me that the company was not involved in organising a demonstration of the helicopter on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the duties of the President and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly allowances for 2017, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, flights from Quantico base to the White House from the state of Virginia and back lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using a helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are included in the annual appropriations."
According to a study carried out by RAND in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to show American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and, therefore, will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to point that out. "
I don't know if Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track. The trains have to be replaced by buses.
The passenger train traffic between the Wall River and Vaasa is broken due to a technical failure, indicated by the Railway Traffic Centre.
For the time being, trains will be replaced by buses.
The fault of the traffic control system caused a thunderstorm.
The train traffic centre had not yet had an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela requests the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court decision which would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the elected representative for last Sunday's vote is due to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, a representative of the country was elected, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, an obstruction order has been requested for suspicion of electoral fraud.
Mr Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation from the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the parliamentary vote told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the representation, and the elected 545-member representation includes, among other things, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the House can break down the opposition-led Congress and change laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution to be a means for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Mr Maduro and called him a dictator.
For their part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise the new representative.
Mr Maduro claims that the new representation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela sank into an economic crisis when the price of oil fell.
Now a lot of people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate its opinion on Friday, when the new representation is due to begin.
A Russian man released by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Court of Justice of Minneapolis in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for participating in a global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request made by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland surrendered Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, says AFP.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after he has been sentenced to prison.
After the arrest, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticised Finland and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The cheaters then used the data by continuing to control Internet traffic, which was used to create click cheats and distribute spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, vice-president of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of targeting cybercriminals who operate in other countries.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press release.
Modified at 20.58: Corrected the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos's third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will play a leading role in the Netflix hit series.
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during Narcos' second production season, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The Recreational Service has already confirmed that the series sees the third and fourth production seasons. The third-season trailer has been released and presents the new villains of the series.
During the third production period, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world.

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) has its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages contacts with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently published trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian police officers in the war against drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola carries out an exceptional photographic work in Paris
Kari Kola (Kuavsä), a photoartist from Joensuu, will carry out an exceptional work of photographic art to celebrate the first day of light set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola is doing a work of photographic art called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the building of Unesco headquarters Fonteney and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I would like to highlight not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make what I consider to be important tangible, "Kari Kola, a photoartist, explains his work.
I am very impressed by the invitation to participate in the first International Light Day and bring the art of light into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was at the opening of the European Year of Light in 2015, when she lit UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to reimplement my art at Unesco headquarters, "says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola will continue.

The first Light Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of Paris on 16 May.
Two men were fighting in the mall parking garage in Espoo.
Two men got into a fight in Espoo in the parking garage of the Big Apple on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a oral argument between the drivers.
The driver who was driving in the prohibited direction of driving hit the driver of another car, which resulted in his car moving, bumping into the car of the batter.
After this, he hit the hood of a car that was still hit.
In his initial speech, he has admitted that he caused the damage and did wrong.
From Timo Soin, the title of the question mark was: "After that, there was a flood."
On Thursday, Timo Soini (uv.), Minister for Foreign Affairs, published a blog title with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the government party of thirty-seven Members of Parliament.
After that, there was a flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references in the text of Soin to France in the 18th century.
King Ludvig XV or this mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the water flood metaphor.
Depending on the interpretation, in the books of history, the words "after us, the flood" or "after me, the flood."
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
Elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote on them, said the head of the UN Delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim director of the UN aid delegation, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are candidates for the elections of the Provincial Councils, three women are seeking Vice-President and more than 30% of recent registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be emphasised too much," Mr Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have issued electoral threats at the same time as international troops are moving into a consultative role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flooding of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, local rage is directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the big troops are barging through the sights.
Venice is choking on tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice will no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move ever further away from the historical centre while hotels have been replaced.
The New York Times and the Guardian are writing about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon a low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give two or three hours.
You follow the guiding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and you turn back, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of urban identity.
The market of St. Markus is also one of the most popular destinations of the historical centre of Venice.
On the edge of Tori is the church of St. Mark's.
The local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 local residents living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were some 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, it was estimated that 2 000 Venetian people were demonstrating against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time Venice will be nothing but tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create a need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is intended to distance the cruisers from the historical centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative territory of Veneto, where Venice is located, were to be given more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
In Venice, about 20 to 30 million tourists visit each year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad kilometres of traffic on the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, there have been kilometres of traffic during return from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is covered by motorway coating, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For some there is a limit of 50 km / h instead of a standard 120 km / h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had progressed at a practical pace during the Thursday afternoon.
Road works progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, the golden deer.
I get along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Luel has published great pictures of herself around the Grand Canyon, among others.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian national, has risen to be a popular athlete in Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-metre race by circling the course at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre track during the Norwegian record 55.38.
Luel, who used social media hard, soon after his record, discovered that fame and publicity had its downside.
Men from all over the world began to send pictures of Luellle's genitals apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account outside.
I got a lot of "dirty pictures" from people I don't know, so I had to turn my account into a private account, and Luel told the VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, Luel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along fine without that kind of attention.
Luel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Luel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12, the family moved to Namibia first, then Pakistan because of her father's work.
After that, it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Luel exercises with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions. They just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Luel said to VG.
Amalie Luel holds Norwegian records for 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence race.
The foot injury took the snowboarder Janne Korve to the brink of his entire career - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice not to get hurt."
Now it's been nice to count when nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, among the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again enjoyed her beloved species.
Last summer, the career continuum was at stake.
The stress injury on the foot table had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg had no desire to heal.
His hands had hit the race line too.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was going to do, whether or not the board was going to continue.
Sponsor deals were out of order and a lot of things were open, Raven says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started pulling up again.
After that, it was an easy decision.
I knew that at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, hell, yeah, this is so much fun, let's take a couple more seasons.
The raven was able to count properly only in September to October, but after a long recess, it's been a big deal to train without pain.
Raven has only been around a few races.
It's okay.
The competition has never been the most important aspect of the ferry to Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim four years at one race, and then you're in a fever that week.
I can't think like that, Raven says.
Today, Raven is racing in the halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Even though individual races don't keep him on board, he always lights up when he's in a tough company.
According to Korvi, the appreciation of the International Ski Association's competitions has increased over the past few years, although some of the boatmasters chose Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yeah, it's a big race. It's a big show.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the race.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on the 12-person team in Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The team's potholes, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch your younger friends go.
I remember when myself was at that stage that everything was new and so ill excited about everything.
It brings new power to itself, Raven thinks.
I can still keep up with my chest, but by the way, no, that's how much power the guys have!
In the background of the plate career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The pilot legend Pekka Korve's son is addicted to a horse racing: the boatman has his own horse riding horses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, I don't have time for that.
But every day I look at at least the treatment results and usually some starting points, Raven tells me.
Treatment guidance and training are, according to Korve, a potential career plan when the board career is completed in due course.
I don't want to go that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and evolve, and maybe in the summer, I'll drive some way out.
If it's my future profession, then it won't be hard to start when you're already inside the species.
The medical articles also include the Elliplopet Ravistek with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitilopet competition.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone very well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still a while, let's hope to get the ship full, Raven says excited.
Attendo nursing home project for Kitele has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new care home for 41-seat elderly people to be built on Kitee.
The building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the Health Road of the health centre's neighbour.
On the crystal, the general question of wonder is where the new care unit will be filled with customers, because now, during the Siu wars, many private nursing homes are suffering from a shortage of clients.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that in future, Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, "Flink says.
Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kitee last year, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to remove functions from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the directors of McVitie's inventor of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Department of the British General Trade Union GMB, the company has not told us its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The plant producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products has more than 500 employees.
The McVitie's brand-owned Pladis company reported that it invested more than GBP 5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives "will be told first 'if there are changes in activity.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to "respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines'.
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is extremely concerned about the lack of clear information from the factory manager on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force is heavily concentrated in the local community and in the Glasgow metropolitan area.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising living costs and continuous cuts in production, East Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production very badly. "
According to Pladis' spokesman, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before and the company replied directly to the letter because it appreciated the continuous interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with workers and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we constantly assess all our business activities and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the notifier, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform workers and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the factory."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
LLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying £189 million for the termination of the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of the record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked-about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfers. The previous record was less than half as low: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as PSG will offer him more than GBP 500 000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way in which Neymar has left the company by force. The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the Chairman of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponents and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they'll have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have committed precisely this: it expressed its interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

Now, the phone calls Trump was making up, the White House spokesman, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House acknowledges that the two calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, never took place, says the New York Times.
Trump's calls with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scout Association have proved to be made up.
The White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the Scouts' leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, had discussed it at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, they happened face to face, Sanders explained.
Speech to the Scouts aroused resentment.
Trump told me on Monday that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump's success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told me that few will ever come across the southern border of Mexico again, because they know that the trip is going to go to the US border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government issued a press release in which it said that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published the perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump glowed his speech at a big meeting of the National Scout Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Scout leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scouts' Association announced that it is not aware of the call from any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organization, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the Scouts' meeting was a great surprise, as it was exceptionally political in nature.
Among other things, he was glowing the results of the presidential election last autumn.
