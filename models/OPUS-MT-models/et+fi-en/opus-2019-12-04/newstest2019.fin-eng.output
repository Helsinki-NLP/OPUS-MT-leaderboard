Emeli Kouki led the Hurrican home victory at the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
The Hurricane-Loomaa, which had been in the medals of the men's volleyball Championships seven times in a row, started the season 2018-19 at home when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, the general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loomaa.
It was pretty quick to work it out, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Lõimu, supported Kouk by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points on a match-specific contract.
It's always important to win the opening game.
A lot of players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra cash to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the medal line is of course a goal, Kouki said.
I will determine Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Vettänen was 18 points the most effective Savo Volley when the team knocked over the Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially at the point of attack, but luckily we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious download when I was playing against my former team, "said Vettänen.
Next to the volleyball in the 3-series period 2000-01, Antti Siltala, who started his career, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hangar was small, which means the mood on the ceiling all the time.
I got a good feeling about the house opening.
Miro was the king, Silli played a good game, Tovinen said.
The previous period in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in the Sammo of Pielavesi when Tuovinen was also head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most efficient at 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Aka-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, the winner of the 2012-13 league score exchange, has started this season strongly.
The Hacker scored 25 points when Akaka-Volley took his season opening victory after the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started from its own point of view.
Today, of course, there was a defeat, because we were the fourth loss between 17 and 21.
We dug somewhere for a backhand victory, and the fifth round came in the same way, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective Tigger was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
The countryman Aleksandrs Kudrijashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's picker. Mikkonen said it was good.
Finland Human Capital Comparison World Number One
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says Science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was placed one higher and instead of Canada was found on the list of Taiwan.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst compared.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population will be examined.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, the local game ended with no goal.
Real Madrid's goaltender Thibaut Courtois went on to take a great fight, and the Madridian team's local game ended in a goalless tie late Saturday at the Spanish Football League.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian watchman Courtois was able to resist.
Courtois played at Atletico for three seasons at a loan leash when he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation, Fifa, chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was headed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale was switched after the break because of the thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters screamed the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - a powerful documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected by President Donald Trump, candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many wish that Kavanaugh's decisive vote would reverse the decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has taken place over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (in) has been doing public work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of our country's representatives.
At the beginning of this powerful documentary, we will meet gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the State of Missouri because of the blackmail of the laws.
An armed guard at the clinic says he stands up for the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Association led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the questioned pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed; a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States in a year or so.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
As early as 1967, in California, the law on abortion was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential election campaign in 1980, who began to turn a blind eye to the politics of the electorate.
His abortion position was also rolled by his successor George Bush Senior.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
To the deepest core of the matter, the document reaches the bottom of the agenda for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When religious organisations in favour of segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen for a cane horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
In writing this is the case in the United States where the President of the United States has chosen Kavanaugh, who has now been accused by several women of sexual harassment, who has been bragging about the voices of the religious right with his abortion.
Kavanaugh can have the power to determine the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on their balance of language.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border with major demonstrations.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, with Israel firing at demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and created an air strike in the border zone when the demonstrators threw stones and explosives at the Israeli troops.
The army says that they have begun to use force so that protestors do not break the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in demonstrations in Gaza since March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 people are injured.
The demonstrators call for Palestinian families to have access to the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli state was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got himself a kick in the ass. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's topper, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penitentiary area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game go on.
His interpretation was that the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
Well, I guess it got a little rough on Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at 85 minutes after Santa got knocked down.
Ward showed me a punishing spot, and Mario Vrancic knocked out a 1-0 goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish chest muscle.
I had another taste for Santa's work.
After he lost the ball, he went all the way to the end.
He created goals and defended himself tirelessly.
Norwich had the fifth fight in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league.
There's a five-victory streak on the back.
Pedophiliac support service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that at least two per cent of men and a small proportion of women have some sexual interest in pre-teen age.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails began in Sexpo, providing advice and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised during the coming autumn.
The sexual preference towards children is a disgrace to many.
Most of those who notice pedophile emotions themselves have not done their fantasies and have not done anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that are distressing and depressing them.
They also complicate normal life, says General sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a special expert on the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the American President, Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize, based on the odds of betting.
Trump's role in obtaining North Korea is in the background, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites of the Nobel Peace Prize are, on the basis of the odds, the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between Korea and Korea is significant, as last year it was still good.
However, the rewarding of Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and who is leading the country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be published from Monday, and on Friday we will have the most attention, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, then one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has treated thousands of women victims of mass rape and has become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been seen as a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has told us that this year there are 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he had Nobel.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are some aspects that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Nobel Prize Committee in Norway has often given credit to the people and organisations representing liberal democracy and multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, three American politicians have won the prize, all of whom have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would therefore require an ideological translation by the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like lemurs and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in the Lohja took place on 8 September.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off due to the announcement in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that there was a systemic failure, the fire department tried to bring the traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it couldn't be opened, because there are motorists in the road in shock, and they're driving in any way they can, the emergency firefighter Pasi Käriäinen told the STT about his freshness at the time.
At that time, the motorway was set to go in the wrong direction only after waiting for a moment.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, some others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, the Transport Security Liaison Officer, is surprised.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for anything but a compelling reason.
Transport security points out that, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to put traffic at risk by hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always be provided with as free access as possible.
Driving in opposite directions on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as is making and cancelling a U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reasons is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases of the driver stopping in the tunnel to brush the snow out of his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in the Traffic Security Bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans carried by inland waterway M / S Tampere would have liked to stay on the boat to continue their victory party, even though the boat had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrja, the ship's captain at the time of the event.
The M / S Tampere from Hämeenlinna to Tampere drifted off its route late on Saturday night and was caught at the bottom of its bow with Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one got hurt in the beard.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them by the fire department to the harbour and by bus home, Syrija said to the STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the Ilves and HPK match, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the Discipline, Saturday's beard was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavede was about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest waymark was covered with logs, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark bridge.
No more significant impact
Haveri happened on the west side of the narrow jumusensalmi shortly after the shipping route had crossed the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the case, according to Syrika, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant impact.
According to the Discipline, catching up to the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and with this view, ship cruises continue normally.
The diver came by Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before they started towing the ship off the shallow.
In case of doubt, we will go to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage, "says Syrika.
The Syrika believes that the next cruise to M / S Tampere, booked next weekend, can be arranged as agreed.
According to him, the ship's cruise season will continue until the Fourth of July.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department got an alert on the case a little after 12: 30 on Saturday night.
Ambulances for evacuated passengers were called to the port of Vyala, but there was no use for ambulances.
The day-old firefighter Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and rather hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue station informed after half past three on the night before Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and that passengers had been taken by bus to Tampere.
A cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's nominee for harassment and drinking may be out of office.
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge from the Supreme Court of the United States, may well not have the job he is seeking, evaluates Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to the Aaltola, the suspicion has put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up posing as another person.
In the United States, it has happened once in a while that the President's candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the nominee has usually withdrawn himself, "says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain on the democrats.
The Supreme Court of the United States seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably rain on the democratic party in the forthcoming mid-term elections to Congress.
It would increase the turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There will be no appointment for every presidential term, as the Supreme Court judges in the United States will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70 to 80.
Some Republicans are hesitant about calling them names.
The judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America will normally be the subject of a background check, "says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only given the FBI a one-week deadline, according to Aaltola, it can still bring up something relevant.
It might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to the Aaltola, it is certain, at least, that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will be discussed vigorously before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate between 51 and 49 votes, but at least two female Republican senator is believed to be sceptical about the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the appointment would be put to the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
A woman identified Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has informed the Broadcasting Company BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman told me that it was a military intelligence agency called Anatoli Tshepiga, who works for the GRU.
The Internet community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they had exposed one of the suspected men of poisoning to Chechnya.
They said earlier that they found evidence that men's current identities are aliases.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified a young Tshepiga from pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the British police photos of Ruslan Boshirov now called himself.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The scripts survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the honorary mark of a Russian hero in 2014, among others.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning earlier in September told Russian television that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people in a bag in a war reform
Now there is a living example of what the change limitation on war reform, as defined by the Government of Sipilä, means in practice.
My birth municipality, Vala's war services are produced by the Oulunkaaren municipal association, whose health service director has been elected in 2016 as Attendo's former regional director.
The heads of the joint municipal council are warning the council about the change limiter.
If the war costs rise now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were scared, and most of them are prepared for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre's bed department and a small unit of memory-sick people.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots to the health centre for treatment at home.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay customers for it.
The Left of the election did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event, with many relatives, close carers and also delegates from other parties.
I introduced the war-country preparation diodes to how in the municipality of Vala the elderly are already treated most at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
There was also a councilman from the neighbourhood, Carina West.
The local paper made a big story about the event, and it put the Oulunkaarre drafters back on their feet.
The war planners do not write in any piece of paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vala, which is now waiting empty for its inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service chain, but do not tell us what level of care it can receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until they are admitted.
Without a nurse?
It is because there is no doctor's night care there that the facilities of the health centre are closed down.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Centre for the Health of the Vale.
The example of the election shows how central officials run delegates with inadequate information and the delegates are placed against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Central Party is emptying the inhabitants of the Vale, for who will remain there in insecurity to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one of the elections downtown to keep the whole country inhabited?
The Turkish President, Erdogan, opened a big mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne, in Germany, thousands of people showed their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyep Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine since this morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on protestors' signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan since Thursday, and the security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among others.
There had also been a gathering of Erdogan supporters near the Great Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and felt that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations with countries which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
Mr Merkel stressed, however, that there were deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Reviews surround the visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he had come to a protest against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final phase of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three of them are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor told me on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by the police in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about freedom and corruption of the media in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the failure of printing, the Karjalainen of Sunday will also have to be posted without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution of shared boxes is made from external memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post office puts extra bouquets in the county.
The newspapers of the subscribers of other Finland will not be posted separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is considerably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, the journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala directly in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virg Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed to be paid by a bank loan.
If the original plans were true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year after year.
It now seems that after an unlucky test flight in 2014, which required a death victim, things are going well.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The number of the toilet flight is 300, which means that his trip is approximately one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future on its website.
At the same address, he also gives background to his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book magazine called Space Travel, and I saw Star Trek on TV.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's what left the idea...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued its undefeated run in the League of Valioliga, when it crashed on Saturday in its home field with the goals of Brighton 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero will be the guarantor of the sixth victory of the reigning championship team.
Sterling was able to direct the fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at 30 minutes on the back of the Brighton goal.
Agüero raised his own march to five when he and Sterling cut the Brighton defense to pieces at 65 minutes.
The Argentinian was able to place the 2-0 final readings on the penalty spot in an easy way.
With six victories and one tie, the City that started the season will lead the Valioliga by 19 points.
One less player in the game Liverpool stalks only one point away.
Liverpool meets a series three Chelsea at his seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Societies selected new decision-makers for their next three-year period from 2019 to 2021.
Anu Sikonen from Ylä-Savo was elected president and Petra Mäkelainen from Häme as vice-president.
The Board of Governors was elected 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Societies will announce on Sunday.
A youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Summit in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year operational objectives: we keep the doors open for all, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, "says the Finnish Youth Societies in their press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In the interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of Mersu was asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikköse from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton runs Ferrari's second driver, Sebastian Vettel, at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told us that Räikkönen will not continue in the garage next season and Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that Räikkönen would put gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his portraits.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming about Formula One, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The Mercedes Valtter Bottas is going to the race starting at 2: 00 on the pole.
The evening paper follows the race at a moment's notice.
Football A-series Championship became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players.
Football boys' top serial level ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 13 o'clock round, the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to take the first place against the Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, Ilves, the second in the championship fight, must win the PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Gulf.
In practice, however, the Lahite championship was confirmed even before the start of the whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less vase, it would not have been possible to start the match.
FC Lahti Academy won the game 16-0.
On a break, the Gulf led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the division of the Vaasan players is that the team has played some of the same players in the A-kids' SM series, the P20 series and the C-section of the Men's Two.
Vasa IFK has been playing against the fall of the season in second place.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in a foreign match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its foreign match against KuFu in Toyvala in Sililjärvi.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno. The rescue department said that luck was on it.
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on the roof of the Eno Tutturisk Road on Sunday around 9: 00 a.m.
Four persons were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured. The emergency services are reporting.
Well, good luck with that. The press release says so.
The rescue department said the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means of intelligence: Acquisition and recruitment already done, no mention of planned activities abroad
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, intelligence law has been prepared by procurement and training of personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million would be expected.
At the headquarters of the National Defence Police (Suno) in Ratakadu, Helsinki, we are already preparing the full end for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo's team, tells Western Media that equipment has already been acquired for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing in the topless... campaigning for awareness of breast cancer.
The tennis superstar, Serena Williams, shakes up again.
Now he's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account where he sings just his hands in front of his breasts, tells the news agency AFP.
The song is Australian The Divinyls' 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I recorded The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to perform regular independent [breast] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this has put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women, regardless of the colour of their skin, all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it frightens many lives.
The Divinyls' second author is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when she was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlet.
"He passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There's a rumble in the background at the United States Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men are allowed to behave much more violently than women players.
A Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not suitable for heights
In addition to the traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves wonderful scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang, China.
It is literally located on the ledge of the rock.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
The noble scenery at the height makes restaurant visitors breathe their breath in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to a restaurant, you need to walk around with peach trees.
The restaurant opened to the hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is reported.
Raven's alley run ends today: This is how it ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today that is what happens to the domestic country drama of the Korpela alley, which has been quite liked.
The third production season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722 000 Finns saw the television as their first performance.
The top figures in themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as there is no follow-up for Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode of the relationship between Charlie and Mirku, we're taking another big leap forward, and I think Charlie's mom is the first one to know what's going to happen.
Ansi and Misa are also warm and, in the light of recent events, very romantic, but then once again, Laiho appears in the picture.
Even the police are suspicious of a man who's a scoundrel.
But no one knows how to predict the fate of Laiha in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is going to have to hear some incredible news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which will put a woman on the brink of tears.
In a week's time, on Sunday nights, Sorjonen will continue again.
Korpela's alley run today on TV 1 at 9: 05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow in a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of arpoos stay at home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go and infect themselves, as the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms hit suddenly, sometimes they appear as creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms feel small, says Prevention.
So is it worth staying home?
According to the prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus will be infected the day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or work.
You can go back to work when the cough stops and there's no fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to get back to the gym will slow down the recovery.
Just remember to wash your hands, mow your handkerchief, and throw your dirty papers in the trash.
But when you're bitter, do you want to move?
If you have to leave home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you can't put your fingers in your nose or your mouth, says Poland.
The sneezing is also limited to the mask.
Well, then how can we avoid an infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the Miss are often connected together.
This also happened with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Suomen krona has received Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Indian Finnish and her father is Russian.
My father's russia was bullied by Voronkova at school.
My mother and father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
I had no friends at all in Pertunmaa. Alina tells me about Miss Finland at the semifinalists' launch ceremony.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty of the Miss found new friends, and the day went on to roll as hoped.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans' ranks.
After a career in the SM League, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the World Cup for 18-year-olds.
In the early days of the dating, the couple lived almost a year away, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning threesome, and with it, I'd get a career, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good confidence and the good thing about distance is that the beginning spark is always going to stay on top of us, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of continuing growth, death on our hands
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Yet there is very little they want to give up.
There is a search for sustainable alternatives to continued growth, but even the theory of a reasonable economy is facing major problems.
Over the last few generations, continued economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, to a standard of living that could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-lasting overcarrying of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to destabilise this rock leg of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed the night before Sunday in Kannelmäki on Sitratori at 4: 00 a.m.
The man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, born in 1968, was less serious.
Older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have caught one person whose potential involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
Events are being investigated as attempted and aggravated assault.

Fresh picture shows change: The strongest man in the world lost ten pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, is undergoing a striking transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weigh 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before the title was won, Hall admitted to doing harm to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the victory of the world's strongest man by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if the title were received.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the April 2018 World's strongest man contest.
In Instagram, Hall recently published a picture of him posing in a much thinner condition than his active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall has written that he is currently exercising aerobically five times a week.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic, Hafžór Júlíus Björnsson, also known as Game of Thrones.
The last Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was the first in 2000.
The restaurant ship M / S Tampere crashed on Lake Pyhäjärvi - "Stroke on the Stone"
Inland waterway M / S Tampere crashed late on Friday night at Lake Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department got a call about a waterborne accident Friday night after 9: 30.
The 30-metre-long ship M / S Tampere has drifted to the elk, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock, described by the fire master Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transported by bus to Tampere, told the deputy chief Jari Nieminen to STT after 1: 00 in the morning.
Ambulances were called to the port of Vyala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had, for some reason, drifted off its route to the west of the narrow Strait of Jumusensalmi.
The police will find out what happened.
The day-old firefighter Matti Willman told us earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and rather hard wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
The divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom after the evacuation operation.
M / S Tampere, which was built in 1957, is currently an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant vessel with a maximum authorised passenger capacity of 180 persons.
A meeting space for private use is also available on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

The ex-managers are asking Robert Helenius for outstanding fees.
The fighter Robert Helenius' evening fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowing the money.
The evening-Sanomat news today of the challenge application submitted by the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Vice-Judge Jussi Kokkila, which charges Helen with interest on late payments in total more than EUR 80 000 for outstanding management fees.
According to the application for a challenge, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've been trying to reconcile, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, Kokkila says to Evening-Say.
The current manager of Helen, Markus Sundman, sent a response to the evening paper, which gives the views of the boxer.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the sum required.
According to his reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a difficult economic situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to organise matches and sponsor revenues for him.
It was literally agreed that Helen was obliged to pay only percentages of her matches.
It was repeatedly stated that Helen did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they provided.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Wage work has never been agreed and would also have been absurd in the situation of Helen, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, from the beginning, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman did not make the draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he said that the proposal was bad and that he cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmine.
Helenius did not fight once when he was dealing with Kokkila and Helmine.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been shown to have a "unidentified but substantial" invoice from the manager's work.
This year's proceedings have been brought with the same arguments.
Helenius considers the posterity of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, as stated in the reply.
Helenius today meets the IBF's heavyweight competition list in the seventh place at Erkan Teper's Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist.
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The host's obituary was published on Sunday in Helsinki Sanomat.
The ad says Päll died on September 3rd.
Päli reported a serious illness on his Facebook site in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at that time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of his acquaintance.
He left Facebook early as a farewell, "says Ile Vainio.
Vainio thinks Erkki Päll is a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a well-liked person with fast-paced inventors and fun things.
I already knew Erkki as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse guy.
That's when Erk and I got to know each other.
He was a publicist for Finnlevy at the time, and he was on different missions. Ile Vainio remembers.
When I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how much fire he had in entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly onto the skin of those he interviewed.
He was a heartfelt man and a good reporter.
A lot of people knew him as a respected radio host for Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking. Vainio says good things.
Over the decades, Pälli also worked with Toivo Kärje in addition to the journalist work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir records.
However, his greatest passion was radio work where he had an original style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous listeners on Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of around EUR 450 000.
The Federation describes the existence of a "full translation" of its financial situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet."
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid reaction and strict financial discipline.
We reacted as quickly as possible to the situation last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has hit through our entire organization, says Kulmala in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement and, in addition, the profits of the World Cups were maximum in the past competition period.
However, cost management must continue to be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lying in the back yard of the hospital, please, in the city on the island of the Indonesian Sulawes.
Only one building distinguishes them from an area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to post-quakes.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returnee named Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesian people, he only uses one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the military hospital courtyard in Palu, Dwi Haris lay down, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the earthquake started.
The family had been invited back to the wedding party.
I was probably forced into a clamp under a wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, but Haris told the news agency AP according to the British media.
Small shops are being robbed
Please, at the evacuation center, the 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the mood in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma told me.
Many please residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was like standing up, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the people in the ground.
According to News Agency AP, over half of the prisoners who were in prison, please, escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
The number of prisoners reported to be around 560, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, "says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were furious and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to go looking for their relatives affected by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Please, the airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first ones, an army C-130 transport plane landed at the airport, bringing back aid supplies.
Commercial flights Please allow the airport only to a limited extent.
The pilots will be forced to land in the airport without the assistance of air traffic control, as the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night

The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be a typical autumn of varying weather.
Well, that fall is starting to get on real serious now, "said Ilkka.

I love the mood!
We believed Erik the whole time, but half an hour before he got here, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Indian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about the beauty pageant.
The parents' wish was that Alina would get to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina wanted to get her degree before the pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn't taking part, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports, and he eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, you can see that.

Alina's parents believe that it's going to be a Miss year for young people.
Yes, that's the plan!
My parents wanted my daughter to be here soon.
It's been such a long recess in visits because of the missy rush.
I'm sorry to hear that you've been texting me.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - thought of the idea of a cartoon: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organic nonsense once left my husband's statement, where he suggested it to a story I developed as a person, says the Espoo comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was an EU translator of economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnees ten years ago.
I've had a great time as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what it would be like to grow up when even a little child started to grow up.
Then a comic book came in in 2014.
Piippo tells me that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
I'd been drawing since I was a kid, but when these organic stuff scripts started to come along, things changed.
At first, I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilful artist, but I couldn't attract her until summer 2016 when I bribed her with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying for himself, laughing at Piippo, which tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw for the paper. Piippo tells me about his relationship with the drawing he usually does at night.
I keep thinking about scripts, but I don't usually finish them at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd be happy to play with the colors.
It is always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo tells us that she appreciates the current series photos of the newspapers, including the Dilbert of Scott Adams.
The people of organic stuff are the carrot-body mother who has a salad-haired brush that has been raving for the L-theme.
The other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own lives and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer coercion, even though she gets into organic stuff sometimes.
Piippo tells me he's reading his series with his husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you drew and you realize this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for a housewife!

The earthquake in Indonesia: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself... didn't leave a crack tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
The Indonesian earthquake has become a hero of a 21-year-old air traffic controller, Anthony Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the tower of air traffic control until he managed to get a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the island shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was on call for air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others escaped from the control tower, Agung refused to leave its place before he could direct the Batik Air aircraft from the runway.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, and the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower wavered and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping off the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, told the Jakarta Post by a representative of the aviation administration.
The quake continued to increase as the flight entered the air and was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn wondered about Europe's conclusion to the trade war: "We have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth projections.
President Olli Rehn said at the top of the list that, although the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the decisions taken by companies to invest.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
In his view, Europe is very much in the service of its people so far.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grumbling at the feet of the trade war.
We have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in Yle's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted sharply yesterday on Thursday evening to the budget deficit presented by the Italian Government.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and over ten per cent is unstructured.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again overstepping its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy was taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be at peace.
There would be a much more negative impact of the dispute.
Rehn became President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just a year 's time.
The debate about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name has been flashed in the speeches.
Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment on it further.
HS's super-popular Black Box performances will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by the Helsinki Sages will continue again in the week beginning.
Other presentations will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23rd The Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale at the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets sell Tickets.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a true story they have long prepared, which has not previously been published in any of the HS instruments.
There's something else that no one's ever heard of.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from across the world and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the journalists and photographers of the HS and to continue the discussion.
The Helsinki Sanomat has been hosting live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already been to the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a year's journalistic act.
The winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the wish of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box for the spring season 2019 will be seen in the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation we will see at that time has a different content from the one we have seen in the autumn of this evening.
A missing fungal inhibitor was found due to a "prejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is one of the top in the world: "We are being asked for training"
According to the principal of the Police College, the police can use the drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in the field of crime scene investigation and intelligence.
The Oulu police were able to find a fungal inhibitor in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Mr Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the University of Police, pointed out, among other things, that "we are also the world's leader in this area through an unbiased experiment and effective education."
Drone is a very new piece of equipment and even more recent on police missions.
There are no statistics that Finland's police are the master of the use of the drone.
According to Mr Himberg, there is a strong view that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to look at the drone activity of the Finnish police.
They're asking us for training.
More widespread
Mr Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As has been said, in the case of Raahe, the lost was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're going to train them more.
The drone is already being used to a great deal in police work, and its use will become more widespread and will increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, Himberg states that the police can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime scene investigation and in certain intelligence missions.
For example, we need to go back a little further and perhaps fear that there will be violence.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence purposes.
Karelian Rugby got into the first division.
In Kuopio, Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division on Saturday.
The Joensus were still at a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club in the middle of the match, but in the second period they found a plot and whispered the guests of the South 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division Championship knew the historic rise to the 1st Division for Rugby of Karelia.
In the past, the club has played first, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-pillar 1 division.
The club's going to take the show, but it's going to be a hell of a job next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players needs to be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer distances, so the raising of funds must also be in line with this.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
In the hockey NHL playing Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien confirmed the club on Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super promise for Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round number three at the summer reservation.
The attacker joined the Montreal training force in the rest of the summer and has presented strong excerpts in September training matches.
Kotkaniemi was able to score in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish man for taking big steps after he arrived at the encampment camp.
The NHL regular season begins on the night against Thursday next week's Finnish time.
Montreal meets the opening tour of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader like?
Much has been said this week in Finland about leadership.
The chairman of the Nokia government, Risto Silasmaa, told in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he enlightens his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia studies have also mentioned the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and non-talk, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company's ascension phase disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum also held a big business event in Helsinki during the week, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the exhibition centre.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world rose to the stage.
That was enough talking about good management.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management, said that a good leader should have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally bound to past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods chain known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that cannot be merely a victory for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote the success book about introverts, told us that the most successful leaders were investigated as being humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they're introverts.
The financial professor, Aswath Damodaran, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of the company.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These teachings at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of being misled by information.
It takes a lot to get a good manager.
That's why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilamaa and Ollila.
They used to talk to each other in front of each other in a comfy manner.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it wasn't easy for an outsider to judge their humiliation.
Sara Chafak arrived in a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles, spending most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Finals in a great black dress.
The dress of Miss Finland in 2012 also contained a lace-like scratch.
A little poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he knows.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. for a audition.
He's done some advertising, among other things.
In his work in the United States he describes interesting and also similar to those in Finland.
However, he said that work must be done even harder, as there is always a substitute for work in the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
The Korean choreographer Sonya Lindfors will be awarded a live art award of EUR 30 000 in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, the winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors art is vital to its surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in the environments from which they were previously absent, the panel described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the great Volvo wanted in the operation: "We can't tell you where."
The extensive search for the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Öresund and the Great Belt.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
He reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We found the car we were looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet. Henrik Storm, on the announcement of the Copenhagen police, will tell Evening-Sanom.
Storm says the black Volvo we're looking for has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
A Danish man named Extra Blade told me about a police briefing on Saturday.
Director of Investigation Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of criminal record he was working on.
But Skov told me it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell me if they've already been caught.
According to the newspaper, ferry traffic restrictions have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed events in their Twitter account.
The STT says that, according to the police, there is no longer any cause for concern for the general public, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonian name has caused decades of division - now the people are voting on this issue in a controversial election.
A new name for the country is currently being voted on in Macedonia, the Balkans.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has been veto-blocking Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and of the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
At least the school in the centre of Skopje in the capital began the vote gently.
The retired nurse who voted in the school, Olivera Irakavka, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
That is a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was officially referred to as "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia '.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the turnout is higher than the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow a mandate to change the constitution.
A change to the Constitution will require a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament must also accept the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. in Finnish time.
Nice win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper.
Robert Helenius met late on Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish citizen took measurements of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, located on the side of Stuttgart.
The main match of the night was the IBF League's heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner can be given the opportunity to fight for tougher tasks, which are of considerable economic importance, as seen on Saturday.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to injury and withdrew from the fight.
After that, it turned out that the German had suffered twice during the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times in his career as a clear favorite.
Hamilton's deposit order for victory - the difference between Vettel and 50 points
The Formula One Championships approached their confirmation once again, as the Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and stretched its World Cup lead to 50 points (306-256) in Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole station for the race, drove to second place.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who won the opening of his career, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, the Ferrari Kimi Räikköne fourth.
Max Vertappen, who started Red Bull from the last line, was the fifth.
The two of them assaulted a Jew man in Joensuu. They got caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at the bridge street 12 on Saturday after 6: 00.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
Police picked up the suspects, a July-to-July 35-year-old man and a Iomantic 39-year-old man from a block away shortly after the incident.
They were apprehended as a suspect in a robbery, the police say.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, leaves his post as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets, according to which he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of fraud.
Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement with the United States on Naphtha.
Time is threatening to end in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Naphtha.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators have had intensive discussions throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Mr Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want the agreement to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the treaty at the end of November, whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow the US Congress sufficient time to evaluate it.
The neighbor thought the candles were a fire in Kakkur. The fire department was called in.
The candles burned in the apartment apartment in Oulu Kakkuri caused a fire alarm the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were called to the scene because of a possible blackout.
It was discovered that candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the building across the street, which was why the emergency centre had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
The police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK match... the rampage in the field and the subway station.
After the Honka-HJK game of the men's football league played in Espoo on Saturday, 11 people were caught by the police, and Teemu Värtinen, Detective Inspector of the Western Uusimaa Police Department, confirmed to the STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and interference.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down, "said Värtinen.
Previously on "The Night Sanomat..."
The fight ended at 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of viewers came to the field from the audience reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fist fights between team supporters.
To put an end to the situation, it took, among other things, the cavalry.
In addition to the field, the rampage took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the capture took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the rampage in the field.
According to the colour, there have been no reports of crime as a result of the events.
The table stone startled the butterfly race to its time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have advanced to the finals on the closing day of World Cup 3 / 7 in the Netherlands.
The race is swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone startled Finland from its record in a 50-metre butterfly race, where he was second in the primordial period of 22.82.
Previously in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki on a trip to SE time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Espoo Cetus, was in the 24th period of butterfly shooting in 24,68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was at the beginning of a 50-metre breast stroke in the sixth period of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the initial batches of two hundred metres of stirring, Laukkanen was 15 in the time of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - the reduced Oresteia affects its visual function
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on the Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Philoktetes, in 1988.
Now the University of Theatre has brought to the National Theatre tour the only remaining play trilogy in history, the Oresteia of Aiskhylos.
In 2015, actors' students from the Theatre University are working with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The Oresteia International premiere was held in Berlin in April.
The atonement of the grass from Orestia summarises the report on the end of the bloodbath of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to a commendable hour in twenty minutes, in particular by intensifying the chorus sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simongian's fine Finnish (2003).
The presentation of dramatic lights and theatrical space pages highlights reduced and bright stage thinking.
The centre of it is alternately the dynamic between the performing performers, and the choir, who move away from the choir.
The performance uses double and triple entries from the namespace.
The actors will not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and this man Kassandra returning from the war in Troy will be displayed on the stage, unlike in the tradition of the ancient tradition.
Of course, the motion does not emphasise its loyalty to the ancient tradition of presentation.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the spectator, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a group of actors from the master stage as a close group, a single organism, to appear in a rhythm.
In the choir sections in particular, actors who are leaning towards very expressive, sculptural group formations will be granted their rights with bare, white curtain decoration, on the stage.
Impressive.
The show tour of Oresteia continues at Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer prepares its first hydrogen truck
This is beginning to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will provide a model for the renewal of a batch of thousands of cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell-driven truck on the market, Hyundai continues on the road of Nexon and ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this type of first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, "said Hyundai Motor Vice President in Cheol Lee at the launch of the contract.
The fists flushed several times in Kajaani.
A man in his late 30s assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and when the third man intervened, the assailant struck him, too.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, he was still aggressive and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to the brig to calm down.
This is being investigated in three forms of assault and violent opposition to an official.
In the centre of Kajaani, another assault occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a man in Kajaani, about 20 years old, hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him in the past still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and a police officer called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
Police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone + 358 295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigate.
Long-line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Päli, known as the long-term supplier of Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pulli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook site in March 2018.
This is it. This is it.
The doctor has also said that, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening paper a month ago.
We need to guarantee the safety of Aunties and uncles.
For the first time in 1984, I got paid for a newspaper article.
You know, with these year rings, when you're surprised at a story, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and occasionally even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a professional environmental expert of the Service Federation (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us what's really going on.
The problem is growing, although the employers say otherwise, of course.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly serious, and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
"It is true that companies have a duty to record their near-miss situation on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Spiritual injuries don't end up in statistics.
In situations of violence, there has always been the problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
In spite of this, mental trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive intimidation has to be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of what they do at work, even if it doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has secured security.
With the release of the opening hours of the shops, even in the media, there was quite a big fuss about its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At that time, quite a number of employers provided security services for at least night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but it is creating a new negative trend.
As security kept the incidents well under control, there was the impression that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
A minor abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that an injured seller does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
However, according to the provision of the same law, which was laid down in 2011, a minor assault will become a matter for the prosecution if it takes place at the workplace.
I think we need precedent now.
The next time an aunt or uncle of the store gets assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be charged.
When a court puts a few assailants in jail, and a sentence from there on the hard end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost day and night in small places must guarantee the safety of its workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed off to the Miss before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro is then married."
Missi's crowning is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but the broadcast is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast comes from the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host of Backstage and the red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the broadcast.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg glowing his colleagues while the crowd cheering.
In the front row, the races will be followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke one way or the other.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg cut, looking towards the Saroi.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to Sieppi, who had just resigned, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
Sieppi talked about her divorce for the first time in the evening-sayers' weekend paper.
The beauty of the mission told me that she did not want to open up the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because that is between her and Scrooge Salmine.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to have a new relationship. He was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marital status came up at a later stage, when Sohlberg accidentally misdescribed Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The host trio laughed at the screw-up.
Iroo was married, wasn't he? How did it go?
Janni Hussi signed off.
The Nordic man tortured his bound codend by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has condemned 34-year-old male living in Kokkola for three years in prison for the numerous crimes committed against his partner in prison.
The instrument of crime was, among other things, a belt, cable and bundles.
The court condemned the items in question to be lost to the State.
The harshest charge was about a suspected felony rape.
However, the district court dismissed this charge.
The Kokkola was accused of four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its sentence and ordered a 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two serious deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on 22 May.
These charges, however, were rejected by the court as unproven.
The case was tried in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge provided a public statement of the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, intimidation and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with tobacco, fed strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
The court ordered the state to lose the instruments of crime: the belt and the cable, the ties, the robe belt, the knife and the belt.
Four witnesses.
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
In the sentence, it can be read that a large proportion of the most outrageous acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim's 34-year-old must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has that kind of money, because the convicted man already has debts to recover from his old man.
The punishment for imprisonment is not the man's first.
The evening paper does not give the name of the convicted person in order to protect the privacy of the victim.
A recent district trial is not legal when you write this.
Europe with four points in the lead in the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their leadership in a traditional slot machine match against the United States.
Europe runs the Ryder Cup at 10-6 points on the outskirts of Paris, while 12 games are still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four four-ball games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-game win was offset by 2-2.
Europe's leading star was Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played together on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European couples had surpassed the same.
On Sunday, the two of us will strive for more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have gained more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence does not belong to football"
On Sunday, HJK published a press release condemning the disorderly behaviour of its supporters in the Saturday's FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We regret the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organized men didn't calm the situation down. They needed cops and cavalry.
HJK reports that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in tradition consistent with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We are abstaining sharply from any action that endangers the safety of match events," says the press release.
The HJK promises to assist authorities and organisers in identifying security threats and eliminating mild phenomena.
The culture of supporters is part of football and important to HJK.
We are all in favour of positive, cheerful and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," it says in the press release.
A Filipino inventor flies in a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He is now part of a world-growing group that swears he invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he was flying on his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Workfighting activities starting tomorrow can be seen in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, overtime and shift bans starting tomorrow will be reflected in particular in social and health services as well as in day care for children, according to JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The impact will be broad and will certainly be visible in such a way that there will be not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their kids.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened, Mr Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also evident at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift shifts due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be employed, but for employees to remain in overtime or switch shifts.
This is not a labour-fighting operation yet.
It is quite standard in terms of health and safety at work that regular working hours are taken care of for each worker and only for them.
JHL is opposed to the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader of municipal employers, does not undertake to assess in advance the effects of overtime and shift-shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the necessary preparations.
The region is so far-reaching, social and health action and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary greatly by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Mr Jalonen says that experience has already been gained last week on similar activities lasting three days, such as the Association of Local and Basic Nurses and the Social and Health Trade Union at the University of Super and Tehy.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL ban on overtime and shift shifts applies, inter alia, to workers in the social and health sector in municipalities, the Church, the State and the private sector.
For example, family day nurses are confined outside.
The battle at this stage concerns almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the law on dismissal continues.
The government should now admit that this is where you run to the wall and hard.
Mr Jalonen believes that both the ay Movement and the government must be met.
That's what's so special about this, that the hard ones are already in the chimney, even though the show hasn't been delivered yet, Jalonen is updating.
The Great Coral Reef is born with the power of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show, you learn the gestures of the skate and the sea horse.
The Great Coral Reef of the other premises was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltala.
Like the earlier works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut performance will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the initial observations made in practice.
There is plenty of fairy magic in theatre games for children.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also flashes the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is therefore somewhat similar to the satabaletti, the fitness circle and the nature-related computer attack, but it is once and for all tuned around the visits in other, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with the familiarisation of coral and coral reef living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness groups learn the gestures of skate and sea horse, among others.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be performed where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the Great Coral Reef who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals they look at.
In addition, we have organisms that look at corals.
Views and observations in many directions make the performance dense and life-ridden.
Whether it's the landscape of an organism, the organism that looks at the landscape, the other organism or the landscape that looks at the organism, and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't seem that hard for kids.
In other rooms, the group seeks to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging to reach when a group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, there will be a quiet demonstration at Sitratori on behalf of endangered corals.
Damage beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it could be difficult to understand the importance of exercising your own compassion in the face of destruction.
Others have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of them, whose wonder and play it makes room.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm glad my childhood didn't have smartphones.
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they're younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because other people say they do.
I was confused when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at "boyfriend" this weekend.
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that modern children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they will not have to grow up too soon because of the group pressure that friends create.
I keep seeing younger girls in Instagram who are in their pictures with makeup on their faces and exposing their clothes on.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send pictures.
Girls are even harder to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood was about playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I got to be a kid for a lot of years, and I didn't have to think about what anyone else thought of me.
General: Authorities have informed the State Command that the case of Airisto Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Defence Police and the Defence Forces visited to inform the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of Airisto Helme is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, is reported by Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Mr Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Committee on Defence (Kok).
According to Kanerva, this week the military and the defence police visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be economic crime.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that there was something else, Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of a link to national security has been found in the seized material so far, but the investigation is still under way.
There's no way we can know what's out there yet, one of Yle's interviewees says.
A week ago, extensive home searches started in the Turku archipelago and the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening paper compiled a case which is going through arguments both in favour and against.
Video: The dream goal saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool's 100% Valioliga launch was completed, but it was still a more satisfying team on the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to the 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the whole Valioliga that City was serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager, Jørgen Klopp, came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the League of Valioliga with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone after his own field head.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had under Wednesday a great victory over the league acup from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a magnificent individual performance.
Now, of course, from the very beginning, Hazard was involved.
At the 25th minute, he first boasted in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but then bombed a perfect left foot pull to the rear corner.
Half the brassman, Alisson, was a little slow in his rejection, and all he got was his finger in the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position lightly unjust, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger swept Mo Salah's guidance from the finish line.
And in the second period, Chelsea-pusher Kepa got into action.
The Basque watchman reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's wager and pushed the ball from the bottom of the pole into a corner kick.
On the other end, Alisson zeroed by throwing himself through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came at 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the push of the Brassite Star was directed towards the country team buddy David Luiz, who saved the host's leadership position.
And it couldn't last any more than 89 minutes, when Daniel Sturridge, the changeling man, was free to fire at 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible wager to honor it.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 tie, but it's still at the top of the league... along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer conversation, the porous ones are deep.
I remember when, a few decades ago, a magazine asked various Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in my mind: the Nen terminal.
Some of them have their last names on them and some of them don't.
I mean, you could be born anywhere, and there was this waitress.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of annual clock movements.
Very many people agree that the clock movements twice a year have been the work of fools and have caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest phase of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to solve what time we end up at: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The people will also be able to say what they think on the "fi" page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is taking place fiercely on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their word to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on the well-being of people and those who defend summer time with the influence of evening light on the desire for people to walk and thus on their well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
And according to research, morning light rhymes the day of man and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, brightness increases the movement of people outside and gives you better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I'd rather take both, but the bad news is we can't do anything about our location in the northern part of the world.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of the debate on the subject that one's own vision is being pursued and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other party are hardly heard, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is rather pointless to try to turn someone's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort and there is sufficient ground for mutus.
There is usually the strongest and equally infertile dispute over similar types of issues.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we should adapt to that.
And it always offers you a perfect scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought for a close guest victory
Josba's first guest game at the alibandyn divar produced a full three series of points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led the goal at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi planned a 6-5 goal.
As both teams cooled down, they played decisive minutes in the equalizer.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Ashkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosone (1 + 0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
Josba has six points after three series rounds.
Next up, O2-Jyväskylä will be visiting in two weeks.
I'm at Uncle's church on Sunday for the 200th anniversary.
The 200-year anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in some very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, arson of the church at risk of acceleration was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party tonight.
Even if no one would like to do so, Eno's church is now the oldest church in Joensuu's congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other associations in the world.
The family fair starts at Uncle's church tonight at 10: 00.
After that, we'll move to the parish house by the Karelian table table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, inside and outside.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsanen, who has retired for 37 years.
The church's birth celebration also marks the end of an era.
Already deactivated, built in 1982, the parish house will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in the evasive zone at the old town hall, the chaplain Markku Koistinen says.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor problems, but the church has been standing still for 200 years now.
Elon Musk is stepping out of the chair of the Tesla government.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's CEO Elon Musk have agreed their case with the SEC of the US Securities and Markets Authority.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
However, Musk may continue to be Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to resign from the chair of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside chairman of the board.
Musk will also be subjected to stricter supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor further the communication of Musk in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market failures and adverse effects on Tesla's shareholders," says Director Steven Peik of the SEC.
The case originated in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding was secured.
The treatise temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of fraud.
According to the Agency, the Tviitis was false and misleading and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC expressed its demand for Musk to be fined and banned from running listed companies.
The SEC challenge startled investors, and Tesla's share went down strongly.
Over 800 people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to AFP.
The number of deaths is expected to increase further, as the damage is being resolved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could go up to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked a town on Sulawes Island, please.
Tsunami was given a warning immediately after the earthquake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, from Palu.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to be dead.
Ruthless requests for help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction zone today, called on the soldiers to continue their rescue work without weariness day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is the Palu Hotel, where it is believed that there are still 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the office responsible for rescue work, told us that at night one person was dug alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel popular by business tourists.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, the quake and tsunami area would quickly need heavy cleaning equipment.
Many Indonesian people have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and around.
My friend's family is still missing, and one of the writers appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain.
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to a lack of encryption of the application.
Disturbers had access to ministerial telephone numbers, among other things.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, were the subject of harassment.
Several Members received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public had access to the profiles of politicians in the application, which were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The public had access to profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
Login to the profile allowed you to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to replace Boris Johnson for a profile photo for a while with a porn photo and a title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile was replaced by a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian Columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log on to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting app made each journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticised.
The Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems had been solved and that the application now works safely.
The British data agency, ICO, supported the data leak.
The app was developed by an Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland audience has a large number of clapping Poles every week.
Spectacular viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The fast-spread US format The Wall landed on Nelos last Saturday as a Finnish version.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is described in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the big 12-metre high game wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the initial period, the social media raised the programme's studio audience, which was guessed to be Polish.
There was a debate on Twitter as to whether the Poles who sit in the studio might understand anything about the Finnish game.
Unne Fingermunen, head of the fourth national program, will shed light on this issue in the evening paper.
He tells us that the studio audience includes close, other Finnish, foreign Finnish players living in Poland and Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the "The Wall" sections of other countries in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to different programmes to describe them, "Fingers background.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language used to play it.
Red and green balls fall off the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio for foreign speakers who will carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret as a simultaneous interpretation of the studio director all the time events.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of laptop they're throwing and what's going on, says Fingerfinger.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff and David Hasselhoff were working recently in domestic production.
A few years ago David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's description of Finland in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in the descriptions in Finnish, the sum of the finger.
The typhoon that broke south of Japan is moving towards the main islands - authorities are warning against landslides and floods.
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and there is no record of fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Corporation, people have been evacuated and electricity has been cut from over 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day's time in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami is torturing Japan until Monday.
♪ The sky just got darker and darker ♪
It's been a bad early season for the Aces.
The sky was already darker than it was when the team lost on Saturday at its home field to Vaasa Sports by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Ports now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points for six rounds in total.
No ace defender or two lower-chain player has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
Against the sport, the audience was lost at the time of almost half of the game.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be worried, because that's what we played so poorly.
In particular, the performance of the second round was shamefully poor, Jarno Kärki, who made Ace's power 1 + 2, told him.
Of course, the sport liked the victory.
The team had a game on Friday night, so you would have thought it would be visible.
Maybe it did, but the Aces couldn't use it.
Number of visitors to Bread Day continued to increase
The mother of bread day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the number of audiences at the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe this year there wouldn't be so many people, Hyvärinen wonders this morning.
In the autumn of 2017, together with Bread Day, the Tractor Triangle SM competitions were held at the same time, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of people could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, this was not the case; the corridors were blocked well before ten years ago, the vendors said that the products had run out, that nearly 500 newsreel was sold more than before, and that even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard that there had been an increase.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, "says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
In the morning and in the afternoon, there was a special amount of software for families with children, which I think attracted them to record.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Every year, sellers also turn to Liper in a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread holder.
Mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience in the hall.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread contest, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the martini pie shop.
7 x most beautiful luminaire - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
For good lighting, it's worth a hundred bucks.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in enlightenment.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Indolux.
Do me a favor. Do me a favor.
The more the years of age are behind, the greater the importance of lighting.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that many people experience with their age, when the accuracy of their vision is reduced and more and more dazzle is affected.
The older the need for light is also growing.
A 60-year-old needs a light three times as much as a 20-year-old.
Therefore, for health reasons, it is worth raging on the healing effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior is only accessible with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
There is an infinite Japanese style that combines Scandinavia and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrostyle, with its strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors, has also been inspired by its 70s.
The truth fascinates you in the same way as in the rest of the home interior.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
To express your personality
On the other hand, more emphasis is being placed on home now than before, and interior decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
It may not be the latest trend luminaire, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, "says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Cookoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games.
Cookoo and assailant Brendan O'Donnell are breaking up.
The Canadian assailant played three League games in the orange musk without power points, "says Kookoo in his press release.
In August, O'Donnell moved to Kookoho by means of a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old assailant played in KHL in the lines of Kunlund Red Star and in the farm KHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper.
The Special Game Movement is now recycling not only games, but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-footed customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online shops are packed, for example, in packaging from importers.
All the packages that come to us will be re-used.
We may use the boxes a dozen times as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulu Player.
As soft material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials.
The bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, even in envelopes, we are supposed to switch to recycled material.
The store wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural way of working for the Pelyman, since in addition to new products, the main product range of the store includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion person: The same shirt works in every outfit

This is how you create style.
Autumn trendilook comes from gold-brown and broad-faced corduroy pants, black polo-knitted and grey ankles.
Classical pooloneule together with other classics, blue-green scots and wine-red loafers form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black polo net by connecting it to the trendy clothes: jeans skirt, high boots and thick pantyhose.
Young and classy!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialise in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking words diversionno-razvedyvatelna and the group: the sabotage and intelligence group.
The representatives of the Soviet Security Service in the Western KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, "says archivist Vasili Mitroh, who leaned west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for the DRG groups the uniforms and accessories of the Bundeswehr, the railways, game guards and road workers for undercover operations.

The true story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's movie was made on the basis of them.
Everest now gets its premiere on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard struck the climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 guidance of Baltasar Kormákur shows the struggle for survival, which has been dealt with in the field.
Tragedy has been made into films and documentaries before.
The actual events are also being examined in this case.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of excursions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure on the air, he lost his vision, which is why he had to skip the summit.
Rob Hall kept going and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm went up, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Like a miracle, though, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The ill-frozen Weathers were thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
Clearly, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the co-climbers began to believe in the possibility of giving him enough help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is playing Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church of Uncle Eno.
My uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818 and a family celebration was prepared for Sunday in honor of the anniversary year.
The party started at the Eno church hill at 10 o'clock at the family fair, after which there have been offers from the Karelian table table at the Eno parish house.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
Uncle Reverend Armi Rauvuori was pleased that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to the work, Iron Mountain (in the picture) says.
The fire at the church of the danger of excitement has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200-year anniversary of the Eno church.
Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Evangelical Lutheran churches of Joensuu after the destruction of the Church of Passion.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a charter was held at the risk of acceleration, in which the church destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The media flashed their power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm swelled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, the media, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Institute of Aeronautics has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclad and Crete.
Photos taken from the region show a large number of floods all over Greece.
The video released on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared in Kiato city in the Korinthia area instead of the street because of flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, the heavy wind caused strong sea traffic.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for monitoring of weather reports and guidance from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or the media, brings heavy rainfall and even flood risk.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 shows that medians occur only once or twice a year around the world, typically around September and October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The now blowing storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before moving north and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been raised in Greece about refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The areas affected by the fires in Athens will also be hit by the storm in the summer.
My media was rampant in Greece last November, too.
You should not go to sea now, but flights are scheduled - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the fall storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and it is advisable to be careful when walking, that no branches or other bulk material fly over the storm.
These instructions have been distributed by the guides to a good 3,500 Finnish people on holiday through Sunset trips in Greece this weekend.
The instructions are needed, because even the storm Zorbas, which reaches the horror readings, has been predicted to beat up the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise up to 45 metres per second.
Rough rains add to the weather's misery.
According to tour operators, all persons travelling to Greece via Sunset and Tui who have given their telephone number have been warned by SMS about hard winds.
Still in the air of sun and heat
According to Inka Ikoose, the expert in solar travel communication, on Saturday at the beginning of the evening, it has been avoided by the worst resort.
For example, flights have landed and increased according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Safety ahead goes.
Antonia Schroderus, the media operator for support, tells us that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are in constant contact with our personnel at the target.
At least Crete was still at peace. He told me about the early night on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday at smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had mocked the sun and the temperature reached 27 ° C, "says Ikonen of Sunset.
Zorbaz is estimated to be the next Turkish nuisance, albeit slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there in case of this, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirley Garfield and Janni Hussi fully identical evening dresses in the Miss Finals - this is how they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open evening dress.
Hussi tells me he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who actually found me a really great suit tonight, Hussi's smiling.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirley Garvin.
The two themselves noticed their identical outfits and were laughing at the situation.
Garfield told the evening-sayers that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
The Hussi acts as backstage and red carpet host in the Miss Finals, and he talks to the stars in the front row that arrive.
Hussi has a recent move since he moved from Kamp to Jäkäsaari on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought about it.
Before he moved, Hussi was on leave alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, "Hussi says.
Shirley Garvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention, gathering the curious looks of the pensioners.
The host and Miss Finnish Shirley Garvinen told us on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final that she had had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland descriptions.
There has even been enough speed for Garfield to enter the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on makeup and put my hair on a plane.
This is the glamour.
The evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled his makeup out among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travellers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking in the mirror.
At least my makeup was funny to everyone else.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his nest as a Finnish host for Love Island.
He describes his experience so far as to stop.
Garfield says he went to see the singles on Friday.
In some ways, it's really raw.
They are people's real feelings, Garfield describes the program's single feelings.
How do I dress my knee boots?
Three perfect examples.
Classical clothing is a piece of clothing that operates from season to season in a costume like a costume.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes they can accommodate more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overknee boots that became a fall-off for the fall and winter season haven't gone anywhere.
According to their name, the boots above the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
Shooting boots share users' opinions, but a bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
The overknee boots are actually suitable for any kind of outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, chair or tripod, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good both in party logs and in everyday clothes.
Black overknee boots are also very suitable for delicate outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of the pink, blossomed plumber skirt and the gentle, thick knitting.
A fresh but autumn stylish everyday dress for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spiritual outfit comes from a long, copper-brown velvet dress, overknee boots, looking earrings and a stapler bag.
Although the upper knee boots have a certain degree of refinement, they are also perfectly suited to a relaxed everyday dress with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy hat cap.
It's so easy and still so classy!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo.
They travel for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi's robotic cars play the role of bus simulator, as next spring it is planned to start traffic on a robotic bus in the region.
The project will develop and pilot robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The test shows how robotic cars do on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Traffic Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically among other transport modes without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always provided by an auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with multiple sensors and assessing whether the driveway is available.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays between 1: 00 and 3: 30, Wednesday from 10: 00 to 15: 00 and Thursday from 10: 00 to 15: 00.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops can be traced back to the stop changes.
The most secure way to get in is the number 1 stop on the Otakaare.
The bass player in the Mokoma band fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and got hurt.
Mokoma Group announces on its Facebook site the surprising situation at the Tampere Packing Room concert.
The Mokoma band's gig at the Tampere packing room was a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band bass player Santu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The spider's wrist was broken.
The band will inform you on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santu tripped off the stage last night in the packing room on the last song and broke her wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour will be taken care of by backup, it says on the pages.
The fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the photo update, where Basist Santu lies with a cast on the bed.
This is the news we've been waiting for. It was a bit of a worry how bad it got.
The relief is great, the bones heal happily over time.
Have a nice and quick recovery for Santu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the surrogate!
And thank you for yesterday's job, but you promise to leave out such a strong drama about the end of the gigs?
Police were watching hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finnish Police Department conducted hunting surveillance with the Forest Board and Finnish game centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's batch liaison told on Saturday in social media.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and legality of hunting.
Every hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the authorised number of self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for illegal fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown by the police and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in a fine procedure, police repeated.
To sum up, hunters are very good at respecting the permissions of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mükkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
The Minister for the Interior, Kai Mykkänen, will be travelling to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps in Finland this year.
Selection visits are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and from the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) will first select particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected to join the Finnish group than there is under the quota, as in practice some people are not arriving for different reasons.
On his trip, Mükkänen will also meet non-governmental organisations at the border between Sülyman Soylu and Syria, the Turkish Minister for the Interior.
Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Reference is made to raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but there has since been no agreement within the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of the quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people a year.
Mükkanen's visit during this period of government is the first to be made on the spot by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Affairs Ministers, Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.), were able to move on to their new tasks before the visits were organised.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
And now we're going to go for a walk, and we don't know if we're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday the Karelian announced a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law essentially prohibits the keeping of all animals not specifically authorised by ministerial regulations as farm animals, pets or other business activities.
So everything else is basically prohibited except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it will probably mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that jeopardise the safety of society or good practice.
There is now, in principle, a ban on all activities which are not specifically authorised by law or regulation.
This change will mean that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
In general, government activity in law-making has been weak.
If we now take the road that, in Finland as a whole, everything is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, then you no longer know whether you are crying or laughing.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But a legislative project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is forbidden, something that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be a sensible minister who will stop this kind of legal project from going forward.
Metti Forssell tips: The four most trendy skirts of autumn
This fall's trending clothing comes in snake snails.

Turkey is urged to download mobile phones in case of a storm.
The Zorba storm, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists specifically warned the western coast sailors, fishermen and farmers of the Greek storm, written by CNN Turkey.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday night, the disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the internet is functioning so that people can receive up-to-date updates, says Anadolu Aijansi, local news office.
People have been told to stay home and away from the windows and move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow between 28 and 33 meters per second.
In Greece, the red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclad and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Passengers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
The people were calm, the head of communication from Laura Aaltonen's Tui Travel Agency told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar until Saturday night.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari.
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp in time and time.
However, there is no reason to sink into the panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-wheel drive, and with their stable mate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen, who was clearly left behind at Mercedes speed, said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked why the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are - it's as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, a rare treat was seen for Säikköse's future stable for Sauber.
In the next season, Charles Leclerc, who replaced Säikköen with Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the last time-driving session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth starting point is the best one in over three years.
And even though, in the second driving session, as many as five drivers failed to drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikköse for the future?
Yes, compared to where they were in the early days, the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it, Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper, "Robbe is back."
The match between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper at Stuttgart's night was going steady.
The German was a more proactive player in the ring, but he couldn't get a good shot.
Helenius, far more far-reaching, controlled the match with his hard-core series, which found its way very well.
The Finnish citizen was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left.
The hit was so hard that the convoy who fought in front of the home audience didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite modestly.
At the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the public and his opponent.
Then for a moment, he switched Finnish into his tongue.
Thank you to all spectators and Finnish cheers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a huge victory for Helen's career.
Perhaps it would be an opportunity to even enter the World Cup, Helenius commented on the evening paper before the match.
Instead, the defeat might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is not going to get any younger, the 34-year-old Helen admitted before she met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Difficult circumstances
Saviors are searching the most affected areas of the island of Sulawes for the trapped, as well as the dead: please, the port town and its neighbourhood, Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, there is still no clarity on the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the broken buildings that the saviors have been unable to get out of.
For example, the Roa Roa Hotel in Palu has collapsed.
The saviors say they heard the screams of the people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of cleaning equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia has ordered an army to be rescued and cleared.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area, electricity and communications have been cut off in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
The hesitant response and long reflection of the Miss Finland finalist caused a laughing stock
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected at Billnäs Ruukki.
During the interview round, every Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitant response caused sweet but benevolent laughs in the present audience.
The question put to Mr Anttikoski was customs via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was read by the missionary.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
The recess of the report caused a laughing stock in the audience until Anttikoski continued to reply:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Must have something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his response, Anttikoski received a round of applause from the public, with laughter.
In the past, on a mission tour, Mr Anttikoski drew attention to the fact that he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The year 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00 when last year Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up the crown.
The apple-pear cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples from behind, because the domestic apple is at a shocking price in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think quite a few people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you do not want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if the cake gets its pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed houses.
Sliced.
Melt in a pot.
Whip the eggs and sugar for foaming and then add corn flour and melt butter to the foam.
Combine the corn starch, maizena and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Bread with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar at the bottom of the cup and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let it cool down in the pan and then turn it off on the tray.
You can't cut the cake until you're cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and is easily crushed because the dough contains almonds and maize flour without gluten.
An international crime-literature event will be held in Ruka in January
Kuusamo Ruka will be held for the first time in January an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.
The literary guest of the festival is Jens Lapidus and Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, visitors from Iceland, Norway and Finland are also seen.
The Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers from the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of "cool": generally attractive coolness and the opposite dissident-cool.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers' description, had many socially desirable features: they were outward-looking, friendly, friendly and competent.
Other thinkers, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experience, and they cared little about external evaluations.
Both guys were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of a tough guy is not cool in the longer term: a high status at a teenager's age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is illustrated by the US research published in the Child Development magazine 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good-looking people and trying to favour others had an increased risk of drug use and crime among young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they did when they were younger.
High-status messages from reading cars, brand bags or watches do not make a person cool, or at least a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in the Social Psychological and Personality Science, most people were more willing to make friends with a regular market shirt than with a shirt wearing a shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a shirt when they were introduced.
If you're on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
There's a hurricane coming up there, a weather warning screaming red.
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland, on average, during the six months.
The Zorbas Hurricane will strike Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyklaete or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to a major approach, the Greek Air Science Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported in the Foreca blog.
According to it, the toughest hips in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
The Kuisma storm, which beat Finland at the beginning of the week, blew at its hardest at a rate of 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rainfall.
Over the weekend in southern Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water can come.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has distributed a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Valtter Bottas was shaking and bursting adrenaline in Sochi, is he going to be a helper to Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtter Bottas vibrated a little further for tens of minutes after the Russian gp pole drive when he was in front of the media.
The great tour left behind the first star of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important criticism of the Finnish driver who gathered this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the game.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on the verge once this year in Austria (mid-summer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got some good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so departure is a particularly large part.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to answer his questions about whether he was driving tomorrow from victory or whether he was facing the World Cup title-approaching Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other purpose at the time of leaving the pole, Bottas paused.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and the difference with me is very big, so I'll keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas' success after the race, and the Mercedes' stable boss Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis had an intention to win the Valtter, but he couldn't make it to seven.
The Valter knows he has to tear everything out of himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so loaded that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
To the question of whether the stable will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive honestly, Wolff answered by dodging.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiteinen has won the Finnish Rally Championship
Rally-car SM series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was the Tuusulans Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the final race driven around Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiteinen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him with the Finnish title of two-wheel drive cars from the SM4 class.
The competition between Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started the Turku section competition with moderation because the starting points were clear: the investment in the leading group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the two had to give a smooth hand when some of the extra lights failed with another special experiment.
It was a pretty blind target for a third piece.
In a situation like that, you don't have to be a slacker.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo in the second series was followed, "said Kinnunen.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops in Syria are fighting terrorism and that the war on terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their country of origin.
However, there is no end to the seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel told us in Germany that a meeting in Syria would be scheduled for October with the French, Russian and Turkish presidents in addition to her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge on TV.
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blays Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptional number of people by the screens.
In the United States, the full-scale appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge received at least 20 million people on Thursday.
At the time, Mr Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and the California professor who accused him of harassment, Blady Ford, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary findings, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, i.e. ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, online consultation resulted in several million more.
NBC told us that the livestrim was followed by 6.8 million people, and CNN reported that they made their record for the year with 8.2 million live transmissions.
CNN numbers rise to more than 10 million, including those who have followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million startup.
Digital startup is the channel's own, TV ratings come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are, in any case, dizzy.
Not many people reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually have access to sports matches as well as the major Oscar and Grammy gala in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
Of course, there's a long way to go to the US's most popular annual show, the American Football League's NFL final match at the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Mr Trump's first speech to the Congress was seen by Mr Nielsen in a total of nearly 48 million people and the inauguration of just 30 million people.
It's a very important issue.
The designation of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, because the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Anton Scalia passed away early in 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place opened up when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was, on a number of issues, a so-called scale language whose voice could determine the position of the 9-person court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided by voice that the same-sex person was granted the right of marriage throughout the federal state.
Mr Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his position.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock down the Conservative Power of Justice for decades.
Children have the right to receive information from parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see health records of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of the young.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, it has been promised to correct practices, but it has taken an astonishing time to correct them.
Now we're gonna fix it... in 2020.
As the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an exclamation.
After that, the layman's understanding is about pressing the button: when the wire is held, it will be opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his / her information if he / she has bank numbers or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is paid, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank IDs.
So, in practice, no one can see the information of a fourth-grader except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a matter of parents' rights as of children's rights.
It is of the utmost importance that parents can be involved in the care of the child.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be guaranteed.
Even under-age people can have family situations where not all things can be freely spoken about.
They often relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI started cancelling harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to American media, the FBI is investigating at least two female harassment charges.
One of the women was previously in the hearing of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs.
The investigation shall not take longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, this is a more criminal investigation, and it may not be public.
He threatened to kill cops at a police station in Kajaani.
He was still in the chamber, and he was still in the mess room.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "calm down."
The police were threatened by a suspected assailant on a Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities will report a case that started when a fair 30-year-old man ridden a fight in a central restaurant.
First, he assaulted another client inside the nutrition business.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by dumping him on the ground.
When a third party tried to get in the way, he hit him too.
The triple assault led to a call to the police.
Patrol caught him and took Kajaani to the police station, the police will tell you.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they sent a man to a police prison to "calm down."
He's a suspect in three counts of assault and violently resisting a civil servant.
Grant organisations are preparing to start work in the Indonesian Sulawes - "Clean Water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF in Finland.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency response capability, "says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Sulawes, we are in the process of rescue, but in the Donggala area, a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often of light construction, so the damage caused by the earthquake and the tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
The first thing that can be offered to people is the water purification tablets that Unicef has in stock.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first delivered by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification are part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started raising money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors, will end the $20 million fine on tweets.
Elon Musk, the founder of the companies manufacturing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud by means of an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will cease his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk will resign as part of the agreement with the US Securities and Markets Authority.
By agreeing Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for fraud over the tweets he sent out in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla, an electric car company, which led to a rapid rise in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and take on two "independent directors."
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.
Musk still gets to be Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal 20 million dollar fines, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding 20 million fine to the financial controller.
Tweets led investors astray
According to SEC, Musk's tweet led investors and Tesla's shareholders astray.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange at a price of $420.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by over ten per cent in one day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's arguments had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other management group or company board.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14% when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to reconfirm the company's course.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the Watches of the Cathedral don't ring when the Wise Men don't move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock on the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
Wise men point at 12: 00.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even if the church crypt was to be exorcised and the organ was to itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It's been seen by a repairman, but some parts are broken and a new part is expected, "says Suntio Evelyn Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned in the "Church in Helsinki" Twitter account.
In fact, it is mentioned in the account that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me church bells don't ring because of a flaw.
