Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing persons report about a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-school investigation.
The boy was found near the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, in a frenzy again, tore the paint gap into Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the final king of the Champions League turned at least for a moment to the latter's advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all time scorer statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, who had been evenly read with him before Tuesday, had a total of 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league Serie A in the early days, but in the Champions League D-block it started with a powerful 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The winner was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was blunted by the absence of the knee-wrenching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman, Luke Shaw, had only a quarter of an hour to play the guest game.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with ManU kit so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 cord by 41 minutes, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break with extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Painting Age, Paris Saint-Germain of Section A began.
There was an Argentinian Angel Di Maria who changed Manchester United's shirt to the PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past Malmö's goalie, Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been put on the team for the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
It was the first time that PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced Malmö FF for his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsSKA lost in a B-section match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now on about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess this request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers belong to the home affairs ministers' table.
The professor admits he shot his girlfriend in an emergency call.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake the police in his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor said that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the letter signed by Lamb read according to the authorities.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of dead history who is believed to have been shot by Lamb at the door of his office on campus.
Police Chief Lynn Buford of Delta State University noted that the university officials were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after this.
There was one more death for the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive.
The researchers explained the details in both places, and the teachers who knew Lamb told us about the man, and the researchers gave a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to the Gautier police of Prentiss's place of death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, in turn, had mentioned Lamb's book, in which he had acknowledged "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History with 17 teaching staff. Many of the students participated in both men's courses.
However, reference was made to the problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like he was having a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's payroll policy meant that the dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him assistant professorship.
William LaForge, head of the university, told us that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, M. Methel Johnson of Washington County reported.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told them he believed that the man knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring, he received a doctorate in educational science.
One of Lamb's longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
She and her friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were in love with him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon.
Apparently Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but according to no document, they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river delta in Gautier's small town.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was very upset," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter is composing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julesp Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harp to a few audiences.
There was no indication that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who had received his grief, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, English professor.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and student union.
On the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered at a memorial service in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nightly event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi in Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also made clear that while Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that he will offer his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity for additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40 000 people to shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews of applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October–December.
Although it is still months away from the holiday season, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a moment of great importance for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox said in the trailer of the upcoming Back in Time document.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very much like a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time document relates to Return to the Future films, and the documentary also interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future movie was premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely an all-time time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, commented on the intensified Russian military action and noted that there was no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that weapons would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Mr Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has caused an impossible situation to be resolved.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity as the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Is Donald Trump serious?
They've tried to label Trump as an idler.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some people predict a collapse for Trump.
In Republican circles (for now) every effort has been made to pull Trump down from the polls.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump double-digit support numbers. Some people are already seriously considering what it actually says about the possibility of a real estate mogul being nominated.
However, the elections are still at an early stage.
There's been no announcement yet that Trump will be elected Republican candidate.
The experts remind us that Rick Perry, who was at the pollury at this time in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would find it difficult to hold a public election.
External factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and started digging for his fall.
The following recent Gallup data indicate that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored by a shoulder ulcer:
There's been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run for office in mid-June, according to the Montmouth University Gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of real estate moguls.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures are also held in states where elections are the first to take place.
In last week's Quinnipiac gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In the CNN and ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible nomination.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson receives almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40% of Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a 21% support rate.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't find Trump's temper problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompousness and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be suitable for the president.
The same is true of Iowa, where the first party meeting is held: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be suitable for the Chief of Defense.
However, according to ABC and Post's Gallup, 44 percent consider Trump to be unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temper inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a candidate for the party, according to CNN and ORC Gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's side.
The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if the Republicans support the other candidate, Trump will defeat almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when the opponents of Trump are divided into supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, a poll at Monmouth University revealed that Trump would almost always have a larger support group in an imaginary double-cross between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win Trump with a 19-point difference in imaginary double-crossing.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the poll published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, more than half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's greatest competitor at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Since Donald Trump was invited to his campaign speech two months ago, immigration as rapists from Mexico has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will banish important Latin American voters from Republican troops and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the results of the ABC News and Washington Post polls published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half the votes of Republicans.
The Republican Corps wants a fresh face instead of a political go-ahead. According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, this opinion was held by six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republican activity in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The Labour Party's new front shot of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time during David Cameron's Question Time.
Corbyn will ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party will be watching him with their eyes open.
Corbyn's been calling for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the context of the meeting. Corbyn will now be subject to parliamentary testing after the gathering of the shadow government and the speech of the Corbyn Trade Unions' Confederation at the annual meeting of the TUC on Tuesday.
The Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the national anthem during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been criticised by a number of Tory party representatives, and silence has also reached the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem caught attention
Corbyn's representative noted Corbyn's standing during the national anthem with silence for the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, said in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have asked the party leader to join the national anthem despite the anti-monarchy.
Ten of the shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, claiming disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than one sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, considers that political disagreements on British membership of the EU and on the terms of the government's tightening of benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party following the appointment of Corbyn.
At the meeting of the TUC, Corbyn said that Labour was going to propose amendments to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister for Employment and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron over the past decade in the lead of the Tory Party.
The Labour Director, who promised a new approach to politics, says that he has selected the questions he would like to ask Cameron about the 30,000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, there are too many clashes at Question Time, and he promises to avoid witty words and tossing and instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that shadow minister Angela Eagle is filling in for him during Question Time, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown out the idea that others could also come out sometimes, and he tells us that he has discussed the matter with the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
Following Corbyn's entry into the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted puppet theatre-like politics, which is often linked to Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the Director's judgment, of the control of the House of Commons and of the position, but according to critics, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless to young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for a group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who was the first to graduate through the project.

The pound is stronger as British wages rise
The weight was strengthened by the rise in wages in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index.
In the May to July period wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in the United Kingdom compared to the corresponding period last year.
The faster growth than predicted was fastest since 2009.
The pound was strengthened by 1 per cent and its price was quoted at $1.5505. The pound was also strengthened in relation to the euro and quoted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate increased by 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
The transaction would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world and would bring under the same roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont group focusing on luxury products.
The latest sales figures for Richemont are better than forecast, and the development of sales was also a factor in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent after mining giants announced their intention to raise $2.5 billion in share issue as part of their debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the biggest fall by 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
The JD Sports price rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would rise by 83 % to GBP 46,6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of JD Sports' Management Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean increasing purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroot campaign against Aldi's landslide
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from Aldi's claim in southern and western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Aldin's $700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand by marketing in mainstream media and social media and by organising events like Adelaide.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. Simmo, an ice cream factory located in Dunsborough, offers samples in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to football league games in South Australia at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware trade will organise an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than that of the Eastern Länder' IGA store network.
South and West Australian consumers are well known for their conurbation, and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30% and West Australia 24%, while Eastern states only have a market share of 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain will feed on sales from all operators, but especially from operators independent of chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders can sell 360 million dollars and Metcash $250 million worth of credit by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes," says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10,3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the leading portfolio manager at the Magellan Financial Group, said at a meeting in Melbourne that he was very likely to see Metcash disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, while the food business of 1,200 IGA retailers has decreased by 43 % from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesaler takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than $150 million to meet Coles and Woolworths' prices for hundreds of products every week. The chain wants to support traders in renovating stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food supply of their own brands.
According to Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, price review and store reform plans are well under way and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral damage in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related business.
The younger party of the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, faced an unfavorable spotlight when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in the Cincinnati qualifier match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open U.S., Kokkinakis frustratedly hit the bat field when strong cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
At the moment, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open in the United States. He is by no means the first player to break his bat for frustration. I know Thanas well enough not to be proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well the provocative behaviour of Harrison in the open in the United States, for example, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard and completes the team well. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He trains hard, is in good condition and a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios Australia's team from an important round starting as a Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra's educator to long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of the polemic associated with Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we strive to support him in understanding the consequences of his actions. We also try to provide him with some privacy. I believe it is best for both the team and Nick."
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary, which declared an emergency, closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in a non-man's country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between national checkpoints for an indeterminate period of time in their tents
Frustration began to surface.
While the police helicopter was flying in the air over the immigrants, they were saying, "Open the border!" and shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protesters of the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept that migrants should be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more people arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation will need to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries in the next few days", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
A day later, the rumble on the Hungarian-Serbia border began when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40 000 influx of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and the hope arose that an agreement would be reached at the end of next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would accept 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week in order to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not give its hope for rapid action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to adopt more effective measures, i.e. to close roads and speed up judicial processes in the field of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence is already in place on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finishing of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of people arriving are refugees from the standard of living, not war refugees who have the right to seek refuge, and that vision is radically different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
In Hungary, under the new law, which entered into force at midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence, which the government has built on the southern border towards Serbia, and to define longer prison periods for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a state of crisis in the country", the government's spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt the military measures that are expected next week, and the journalists of the Associated Press at the border have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days now.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's internal security advisor, reported that 45 cross-border attempts were taken by the authorities immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By damaging the fence, the people who have crossed the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the border with Serbia were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday; one border crossing point was closed by means of a train wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos reached the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary when Hungarians opened a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street linking Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a eating and drinking strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership against Bernie Sanders decreased by half according to national poll
The support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still double-digit in the race for the national presidential candidate of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached an end.
Mr Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the Democratic supporters' votes (down from 58%), while Mr Sanders is second in favour of 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure from the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for the majority of Democrats to tell which candidate they are in favour of.
Clinton's supporters, however, are more sure of their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he has only a five percent bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost his lead among the democrats under 50 years of age, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in favor of Sanders was double-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five percentage point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters too if he were to be nominated.
There is more disintegration among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter of them would support him with enthusiasm.
Forty-eight per cent of democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 per cent of Republican voters would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When the voters of Clinton are asked to describe why they are in favour of his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose a female president (13%) and thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a reference to common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President is still assessing his possible candidacy, and 57% of the Democratic voters would like him to join the race, while the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When questions are asked about the second most popular candidate to be a party candidate, the majority chooses Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and considerably more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start with Sanders. With Sanders with him, the head start will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, who is number two, is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual election.
However, democratic voters attach greater importance to the candidates' chances of winning on issues of substance.
The voters do not find it unacceptable to accept democratic candidates or potential candidates.
The voters consider the candidates for democracy or potential candidates to be appropriate in terms of their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered as a leader type.
As many as 30% of democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, 15% say Sanders. 27% don't know if Sanders is honest.
The Democrats believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to their own ideology.
There's no opinion on Sanders for all features in about a quarter.
When voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Foreign Minister, the majority of democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and it has not changed their view of Clinton.
The Americans in the wider world disagree.
Half the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall view of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, most, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when you ask for the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32 per cent honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the country do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, most people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the margin of error of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson's closing Donald Trump's head start in the National Support Survey.
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates held more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% in the CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would trigger a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all sections of the population.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, remain a long way off, and the support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent one way or the other. The survey was carried out in September.
According to CNN's and ORC's latest survey published last week, Carson's support is on the rise, supported by 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
Also in the latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In a man-to-man encounter last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five co-op members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman.
Almost two years ago, five people were charged with murder after the death of a student in the fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The members of the Pi Delta Ps District of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were blindfolded, his back had been placed in a 20-pound pile of sand, and he had been attacked repeatedly in an attempt to reach an object placed across an icy field.
Deng is reported to have complained of a headache and then passed out.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Ps didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, allegedly waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told us at the press conference that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the co-op president, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the instruments, putting the benefit of the co-operative before the health of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, torso and thighs with blunt force trauma.
"Too many families have been shocked by the student's impregnability, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the impregnation since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, lawyer representing Deng's family.
Co-operatives and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
Monroe County's grand jury presented five members of the community for third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members will be charged with impregnability and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be held accountable not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally approved the impregnation," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the operation of the partnership, and the national co-operative resigned from the local branch.
This is how the interest rate increase of the Federal Reserve (Fedin) will affect
The raising of interest rates and the booming stock markets are groping, securities return is rising and the economy is sliding into recession.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything will take and how long the effects will last.
With regard to the economy in particular, we find in history an indication of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, although not always. The key factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why central bank officials have already been so stressed that investors should pay no attention to the fact that interest rates start to increase, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players can see that all the fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Economics Chief Global Economist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a relatively low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the effects can be reflected in different economic sectors:
As has been seen on the market for about a month now, the anticipation of interest increases may increase instability for a time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"Trend appears to be the halting of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst in a recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
A sharp increase in interest rates, about 14 per cent, is generally seen in the market over a period of 35 years, with a relatively steady increase for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average return on interest rates after six stock cycles is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, in Nuveen Asset Management's Chief Equity strategist Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income will start to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate the downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in view of raising the central bank's steering interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 appears to be 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it would last, and in the third quarter it is 1.5 per cent," says the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
The risk of raising interest rates in such a delicate economic situation may be, and it may be asked whether this situation is different," said Deutsche.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year and are looking at this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trade will only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all the withdrawal cycles up to today have been in a supercycle, where GDP falling before the recession will rise very rapidly since the start of the economic upturn," the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the Central Bank has waited for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it's already going to be 74.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market's outlook for interest rate increases, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, return appears to change direction immediately when the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, profits will fall immediately," said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that interest rate increases make long-term and short-term bonds approach each other and smooth out the curve.
"In such an environment, high-yield bonds often do better, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's analyst on fixed-yield securities.
Fascinatingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of a tightening of financial policy adaptation", Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is direct, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit from lower interest rates and local products becoming attractive.
The outlook for the indebted multinationals is weaker as a stronger dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality shares will be more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts inform their customers.
Enterprises with a strong balance sheet overcame the weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better than quality, with an average of 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"Word is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rate debt lose most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
The savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree as to how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being too popular.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
Also claims that the BBC Music Awards are only a copy of the Brits Awards.
Parliamentary Commissioner Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of Classic FM, which increases the pressure on the station to prove that it offers more than just each commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is hardly separated from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be moving in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year appear to be a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of simply imitating what is already on the market instead of new and different," says Bingham.
The BBC Director-General denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers much more live music and informative content than a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music is in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station needs to work even harder to maintain public interest, as the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that has been criticised for entering the harsh commercial channels during the hearing of the restricted Committee on Culture, the Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticized the 'The Voice' talent-hunting contest bought by the BBC from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much discussed, because it is neither unique nor particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 program, which, as star judges, was produced by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was typical of the BBC.
Collins also insisted that the company look for a hit show in its own garage when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be commissioned or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth in e-commerce ever in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000 and last month the growth was the slowest ever.
The online store was strengthened three years ago by mobile purchasing.
Experts believe that November's black Friday can curb buying desires.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online commerce has left many of Britain's shopping streets desolate.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the move, and new sales figures show an increase of only 7 % in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the whole period when online sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online sales grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is on the move, and new sales figures show an increase of only 7 % in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time," Andy Mulcahy, IMRG's editor-in-chief, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online store accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile purchasing.
"It made it possible for more people to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, even from a home sofa.
As mobile purchasing is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the final Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times as many online buyers as normal caused many traders' websites to fall.
Experts believe that black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd in on offers, can help to curb the desire to buy at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion shops.
Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden's family responsible
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the big construction company Saudi Binladin Group is part of the cause of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on Mecca's Grand Mosque
On their last journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery, a crowd of people dressed in white had gathered on the streets to say good-bye to the victims.
The mourning convoy traveled to a pilgrimage site, where only a day earlier the fallen builder had penetrated the mosque's roof over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia claims responsibility for the family business of Bin Laden's construction for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in Mecca's Grand Mosque crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell, Qasim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents who were about to begin their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group should not have left up the crane boom when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the News Office did not report in detail. However, according to the English-language bulletin, the Group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the Great Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Great Mosque on the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a notice on the crane accident and the group representatives have not been consulted for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failure to comply with up - to - date safety regulations and to cooperate with meteorology experts.
Tens of cranes surround Mecca's Suurmaskeijja as part of Binladin Group's gigantic construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi-Arab ruling family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
A crane accident in heavy rain and wind occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (about EUR 250 000) to be paid to victims' relatives and permanently disabled persons.
The other injured persons receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, the phenomenon is driven by cheap Eastern European labour force
The British hire generals more often than before," says Veronique Laury.
Popularity has been increased by skilled, self-employed workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Crewfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Main correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to pass home hammering and painting jobs on to people arriving from Eastern Europe.
Vasarising and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
The British now employ more and more household generals to handle domestic sniveling work, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns the chain of stores for home repairs. According to Laury, this phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at affordable prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open up 200 new stores for traders, while 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth noting the demographic trends, as more and more women living alone today are renovating their homes.
"The staff of our salesmen are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the purchasing decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are in the helm of British FTSE 100 companies and has also restructured the company's management team so that there is a balance between male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost unique, as 50 % of its staff are women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," said Laury.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are down, even though the company worked hard after the closures.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Crewfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The three aces government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think there's a lot of reason at the time.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not budge much, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the aims of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the violent decisions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll in their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the rights of the worker, prominently and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to incarcerate the role of the Ay movement, when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Let's think whatever the organisations do, it's nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's mind.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard saving course: To save 8.5 million, the staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a savings course with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on all personnel with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of around 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to use Finnish railways
The owner of the Halpabus company Onnibus, a British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
First up is local transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the Onnibus plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in the rest of Europe, has expressed interest in rail transport from other international companies.
U.S. Central Bank's interest rate decision time
The whole world is following the meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, Fed, on Wednesday and Thursday, to decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
Just over half of the economists who believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates now bet that the Central Bank would maintain interest rates at the current 0-0,25 %, as shown by a survey conducted by the 80 economists in Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, as the central bank has kept interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of additional dollars into the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare itself for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20.00 Central European time.
Whoever shot Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before a colleague was shot later that same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities reported on Tuesday.
In Gautier, Mississippi, Delta State University, Lamb, who teaches geography and social sciences, called 911 about 10:00 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he shot someone.
Lamb called 911 and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was no harm to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us a motive for shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and Lamb's handwritten note, which read: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took his own life late Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, head of the university, told us that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, but the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentis have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
The man said the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss Lindsay Knowles told us that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them he was not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received doctorates in educational science at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Embellished Stars
The last few years have been hard on the actor (in the picture with his son Redmond on the left).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months because of two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is sad to have to stand aside for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV's defense area during a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno, while 15 minutes were at stake.
Shaw received emergency care in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg and is hospitalized," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
The young man who joined Manchester United's ranks at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now offended by the great game takers.
In the locker room, they gave Shaw oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when a leg breaks in two places, he's on the sidelines for half a month and he's not playing in the block anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have got off easy when the situation did not result in a red card kick.
The judge of the match, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can deduce for yourself, but I thought the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was an reckless two-foot tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how crushed I am. My recovery starts here and I'll come back stronger."
For more information: Manchester United's Luke Shaw aside in the PSV match
The English defender has a particular reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing in the Mexican ranks in the Van Gaal-led Netherlands only in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, every parent realizes that a child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for the David Cameron you saw.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and there is a powerful message in it. I like to read it to my children because there's always a picture or a message we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next part where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to complement the short original text.
"In the city of Aluvia, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl Audrey of his dreams by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see the real tree," says the text. In the version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, Ted had no crush on him.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It begins with the following: "In a city where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book will be so foreign to him. Greedy Kerskanen will destroy trees and make supplies of them despite the resistance of the name character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick creature with a mustache that protects the forests.
Likely, a PR mission of minor importance has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text probably originated from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further on the matter, but confirmed that the text was Cameron's staff's handwriting.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it's still tough.
The encounter with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we have seen the last 3-0 test series loss of England's chosen team on the tour, it is not expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than the team three years ago, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, even though he does not have Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
Trevor Bayliss, England's head coach, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me, and he is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test-beater will have the opportunity to make an impression is difficult.
Lyth had seven land matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and foreign matches.
Perhaps the only complaint is that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming on the team, and he's a hitter, and I appreciate it.
He's a cricket player from an unknown unsub, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start the batting shift with Cook, so we can get an extra spin pitcher into the game while having four fast pitchers, and I'm not against it.
I see no obstacle to the fact that the top pitcher could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a brilliant cricket player.
Moe may not have made much of his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been team three, and that's no big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player to start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup pitcher, and from what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher — and this may be a long shot, but not a lot of curve pitchers have shown themselves to be ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka's batter, as an advisor to the Test Games, may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the species who brings with it a lot of experience because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball on the gaming trip and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to be suitable for international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's games, Root has a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
The renegotiation strategy left over by David Cameron for Britain's stay in the EU is, day by day, in a deeper and deeper swamp, even without the popular Jeremy 'yes or no' Corbynia's choice of Labour or TUC to make a terrible mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wringing – even though not everyone is an act of its own – and some Member States are tired of Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual Congress of the TUC decided that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it were to undermine social security.
We could call it a selfie agenda for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, capture the image of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin, suggesting that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point of no longer caring whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, German rational Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it deteriorates, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces a re-election or successor in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain has a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the selfie British who could use their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and neither do they want it because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 British People's Election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiating was an organized case. "Britain had nothing left in his hand at the renegotiating.
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the oligarchic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, the result of which was in favour of 2:1 joining the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone has a distant memory of Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'EU direct banana correspondent' in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax-bounds, cell phones hacking, and apparently temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair felt roughly the same way about them, but then he realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was even more blairier than Mr Blair when he opposed the referendum; he agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected; when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the referendum in 2005, Mr Blair got off the hook.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby who kindly patted me on the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me, and there may be a risk that he will introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
The majority of people outside Ukip and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told me on radio and television this week when his inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad bet on Corbyn to name the rugged John McDonnell as the shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had difficulty in being on television disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was against staying in the EU under 'all conditions', and Mr McDonnel did not say that to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
Wanting Corby to pass on how sweet a picture, you have to remember that he even touched me. Communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in social media discipline, where paranoia and deception are smoldering.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport for the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least this is what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivocation of EU membership is suitable for the Bennite blockade economy and for the anti-capitalist past; discussions are no longer confined to left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea that similarity unites is a central doctrine in the doctrineal conflicts.
We have also seen the equivalent of NATO, and Tom Watson is unshakable that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British's miserable military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cuts of the Tory Government, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticized the British authorities' statements on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by a state-funded institution that the smoking of electronic cigarettes is 95 per cent less harmful than traditional smoking arose at a meeting of 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented by the Public Health England (PHE) public health authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE described its report published last month as a "returning and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and have highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month's Lancet Medical Journal editorial took on teeth a "considerablely mild foundation" based on which PHE's most important conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor of European Public Health Martin McKee and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policy is based on clear evidence of its effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the public assumes that the PHE's claim that "the best estimate at present is that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria analysis (MCDA), which was designed to harmonise the views of participants on the disadvantages of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, EuroSwiss Health was one of the supporters of the meeting, whose previous independent research was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, the Managing Director demonstrated in the sustainability report its support for BAT's public health performance.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting granted funding from an electronic cigarettes manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from Philip Morris International did not.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for the panel, but many well-known e-cigarettes are involved, some of which recognise their involvement as an industrial funder.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Officer.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the group's study report shows that there is no indisputable evidence that the products are harmful to a large part of the products and that they meet the criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that electronic cigarettes can contribute to smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider this argument premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's Director of Health and Welfare, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every second person who smokes throughout life dies because of addiction to tobacco.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further examined.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom there are nearly 80 000 deaths related to smoking every year and smoking costs public health £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires us to make clear the current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm to traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders," says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series such as Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the production of programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticised the submission of programmes likely to reach a smaller audience than the BBC, at the same time as programmes with large ratings of competitors, as well as, for example, the BBC4 channel.
After Tony Hall, President of the BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years he had tried to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that clearly belong to the software of a competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords' Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes which are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice to its best time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel will accept the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think these would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He believes that the BBC is looking for good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's programmes for the Niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings are not usually measured, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "BBC can say, in its hypocritical missions, that it has made £4 billion in broadcasting fees, but that it has made special programmes that no one was watching."
"BBBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
With regard to the broadcasting fees, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is equally old-fashioned, so that who can get the best out of it.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but the people to whom it is a large sum, especially if the BBC is hardly looked at."
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also gave his own views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, the BBC's current supply is unlikely to have educational programmes – 1 per cent on television and 0.1 per cent on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and re-enact its mission: "to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase the number of broadcasts, such as the Proms festival, where only a fraction of the concerts were broadcast last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offer available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when the ultrasound is applied.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems, so they can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematode worms change direction when subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More on the subject: Researchers monitor brain activity with light
According to researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sonogenetics method, which is used to activate brain cells, heart cells and muscle cells with an external stimulus.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher in Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS therapy is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The shuttles normally don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noticed that the worms start to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves that move into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are found in parts of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control shuttle worms with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal to move in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics have certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain being studied by optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, however, easily penetrate the cell, so the ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy will allow human nerve cells to be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in the clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices — on your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Check out Amnesty International's anti-armament show video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Leghold traps breaking ankles!
Grape bombs!
Remote detonators that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video, produced by Amnesty International, is designed to highlight the British Government's desire to sell arms to repressive regimes at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair in Docklands, London.
Further information: DSEI gun fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
Posters also appear at bus stops and subway cars requiring a second look.
"Important announcement: are you on the subway 15-18 September?" The announcement resembles London Metro's announcements. On the other side of the metro line there is a picture of a tanker.
"In September, a group of gun dealers arrive in Docklands, and customers are asked to help to close the gun fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were displayed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Path Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound "adspace hack kit" with hexagon keys that allegedly provide access to about a third of the world's bus stop poster stands.
Transport for London is not a joke about poster vandalism.
One of the prank ads of the Special Pathol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many move to work with protest activists.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100 000 times per day through Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the multipliers have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, shuffled about the absence of mass advertising and the empty spot on ExCeL's calendar of events, and he thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure company video, but bright colors and animation attract attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring up fairs where there is an illegal trade in torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded on our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative feature of the gun fair is displayed in the exhibition rooms at ExCeL itself, where exhibitors make great use of euphemisms from their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. Army for "at4CS RS to be carried".
The product includes "a specially designed warhead that effectively penetrates the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dormitories
I moved to a dorm 11 years ago, and I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism.
The most important lessons I can sum up with eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory is at its mildest arduous experience and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to talk about it: you tell everyone where you are, how you liked the year off and why you like Corbyn and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, hahahaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe — show interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and the people you wouldn't talk to even when your ripples were in flames and these people would be handing out fire extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
Our own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but your own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More on the subject: Don't even think about connecting dating and college studies
For the Introverts, university is a tough place.
Our own room should be a quieting place. However, many dormitories form a social culture, where people walk from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
It is not possible to say in this environment: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out so I can recharge the energy that I used to date you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my own dormitory who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little weird thing: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you about personalities."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and a delicious surprise can leave them with a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable baking skills from you.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offense in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop of your tea out of someone else's milk can?
Always check with the owner of the milk carton.
You'll probably get a license, even if the milk quotes the owner of the can.
I understand that it is annoying if someone steals something from you, but try to deal with it as adultly as possible – unlike my own student friend who slobbered detergent in his milk as a punishment for the milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when the others are trying to sleep or study.
It's not just because it's polite, it's also worth remembering that every other guy digs a hole...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the guest of the next room to adjust the music to a smaller volume, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam this morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally went quiet, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she took a three-hour exam, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your college buddy was your future spouse, that you would start dating, break up and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your common friends with him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the student is not absolutely the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room where the door is not locked, the limit of pranking and bullying is more volatile than you might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you get over in a second.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be mixed with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door in the other room and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you put in the freezer, but do not put anyone's things on the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple more times.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - House planned as a reception center was soiled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out at the accommodations of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers but those of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Evankelinen folk high school in Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the teacher responsible for youth guarantee training at Kansanopisto, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the mess-up building has a status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, there was a press conference for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Lukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of doing so, and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth's weekend night when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been soiled and a reception center has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
On Tuesday night, MTV reported this on its website.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report has been filed.
Revision 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa. The passengers are upset, "unintelligently idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki Central Railway Station.
In particular, the shutdown strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's completely idiotic because the population is growing and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he'll be coming to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a citizen of Siuntio, considers that the state's train cutter is short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
Then there's regret.
The Y train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those traveling further than the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is coming.
A new train connection is likely to come to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Managing Director of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi explains that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million for the Y train in a year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has certainly paid much more than this.
The R line on the main line will miss two stations.
Instead, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Säinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Trobbing.
Train services decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys per year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million a year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Currentness book: "Marx is worth studying"
The global economic crises have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his principal work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality.
"He is now taken more seriously than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes Professor of Aalto University, the respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Economics and the Business Delegation is not Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells of false opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism," Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be brought to an end.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to study Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Mao and Trotsky and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset as well as other classics," Korkman says.
UN demands war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, says AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not exactly accurate.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, a major military attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The report blames Sri Lanka's armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of a UN tribunal because foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed you to weigh social media
On Wednesday, the student articles in the autumn were a long foreign language, which most people had English.
English skills were tested by over 16,000 trainees.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the English word 150 to 250 could be addressed to the director of the online magazine's advisory column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
In total, there were four subjects of which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic by Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish High School.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
On the other hand, Lybeck said that the fourth topic was nice.
It had to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment "unlikely normal".
In English or Swedish, the English experiment allowed questions to be answered about texts such as adaptation of flounder to climate change and handling large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' demonstrations.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time for them to attend the trial.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support units from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will stop the city centre on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm missions and other police activities, but also to ensure that the expression of a giant mind is carried out.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on a cop's industrial battle.
According to Kujala, support units from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us exactly what patrols are.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
The police recommend that private cars be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sum extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to Railway Square.
In principle, buses remain quite distant.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big people's gatherings, will now be dealt with partly by itself.
The protestors have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark in Finnish political history for it," says Emeritus Siiiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder he's protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government," says Siisainen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are interfering with contract law.
There are a lot of features here that we are really trying to get the Ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the AY movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among those who the Ay Movement would like to be involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you look for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiäinen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (Kesk) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the days of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
Moreover, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power," says Siisiäinen.
The present coalition of governments is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the greatest for years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations of the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protest avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property," says Siisainen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on themselves.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts throughout the country.
Breakthrough Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993 some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliamentary House to demonstrate their work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
'Siberia teaches, the EU stops' was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers dropped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and the collective resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors Striked 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and led to a lively discussion on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to Parliament House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees on board in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Finnish public limited company, the truck belongs to the Finnish public limited liability company, which first reported its cooperation with the Austrian police.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, carry on trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain burning captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing with his blue, ten - foot [10 m] wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns approximately 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going out at midnight. We're going out. We're going out at midnight.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and at 20 meters [20 m] high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients and at least saying he's gonna beat them to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running out and it's already seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city, men who travel without their family stay in tents, rafts and abandoned cars, which has now been found or built by anyone.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great hub of human smuggling, they are dying tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran won't like that.
That's a silly piece of shit all the way.
First, a price of EUR 300 is set, for example, and then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than everyone else and he's only charging 50 euros for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles, most of the highway is nice.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a great sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and screams out.
At Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many believers who have fled the Congo are visited, and a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
For a missionary, it's important to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the missionaries' five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully, and slob among the cross - border peddlers.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they come from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be purchased.
That's how the Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers will go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs approximately EUR 100, handling documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and moving to a European country for example EUR 4 500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to the rest stop where the drivers sleep before proceeding across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping he doesn't have to drive stowaways before Britain does.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kedk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the unquestionable king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which dominates the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, K.q. has been operating and continuously developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury craft scheme: the Turkish ports are renting yachts to take American or European families for a few days on tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are being loaded up with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported from Istanbul by land to a port and from there to Europe by sea for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000.
Customers are stored in human reserves, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the signal.
Once it's delivered, we'll have to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay all the way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other indications of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
The cost of one luxury ferry trip is approximately EUR 53 000.
He does not handle practical matters on his own but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller people to do the work for him.
During the summer season transports are arranged for at least hundreds and K
It is believed that he bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred homes he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Kedk was arrested at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, apparently, he's disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10 a.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three times in the Olympic Games, the new book by the 1,500 - meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton in his book Fast Girl tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published sections of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
But in the finals, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 500 feet [150 m] before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
Another explanation for Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was that he longed for adrenaline peaks similar to those he had received when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came to light at the end of 2012 when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40 feet [1,500 m] in world statistical number one, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the Federation disciplined Norway's ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the sports contract for the whole summer and autumn of last year.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was commended by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union got the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing to the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also care for future generations and would not allow one athlete to go solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that Northug had been granted privileges from both financial and other sources for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, including two gold medals.
He was on the team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
Roast compilers' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Roast Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry skills and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of the high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
International attention to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has therefore been made to make the event one of the most significant international events that will take place in the same day around the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre for the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a reception centre for refugees in the premises of the ex-apartment of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still permanently located in the region, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Eellisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private person, investing a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has not also been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
The case states that, for the last two years, the Kauhava airport has been the subject of negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This matter has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (p.a.) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
Kauhava City Council discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö comments to the journalists at night after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia's and the United States' actions in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and consequently in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the further tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niistö, the NATO issue was also addressed in discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.

The Department of Early Education promises to inform you more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communications need a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If any other channels report as a channel, we'll see.
Now let's use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio speech to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipila takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell of a more general introvert of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse the questions raised by the public debate? is considered by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of the media, by definition, to ensure that political agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuse, television talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this sense, it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in the interests of Yle or in the general sense.
Sneaky bet from the bristle
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in the future speech of Sipilä, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, you should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä because it allows him to bring out his own vision without the use of gravel.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong because there will be no more specific questions.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is dripping, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipil to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different if the government were to inform something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly (US President Barack).
That's really exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister should speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage-earners' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give her speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide in the endless world, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's been found and in the city, his father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to Iltälehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer in contact.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
A Kurdish martial artist Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street brawls among young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other one, and hit without thinking of any of these consequences, what will happen when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani upgrades.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki police, fighting videos have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come up in gross numbers.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever end up being subjected to racism, you'll blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys make me hate that I don't like either.
You're doing a pretty bad job and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employee association will discuss its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff centre association STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, it would require SAK, the largest organisation of employees, to soften its previous position.
The President of SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in a narrow way on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of compulsory laws.
Mrs Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä interrupted negotiations on a social agreement when the SAK refused to commit itself to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: "It's a bit funny to put your fist out"
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government down, or is it supposed to make up with it?
On Monday, the s.K.A.'s union leaders breathed holy hatred against the republican government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavans.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was a conciliatory act by the chairman of the staff centre organisation STTK.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would produce an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk) as a 5% productivity leap.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hastened immediately to announce that his papers have already been completed.
At first, there was no sound from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reach an agreement when the union leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ilmaus, Director for Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhansen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's ay expertise as improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost from Finland's solsticemen, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pieinen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you've already got a settlement paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were coerced by the European Union, to come to a meeting - an issue on which the President was able to remind journalists.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Interfax, Naryshkin stressed.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pry Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue today in the haka forest as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today there will be no actual goal party in Hakawood.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to carve 3-2-end-of-the-mill KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock on Tuesday was a lot better than that.
The Blues, who started the Rauman catch with a tangled start, had round zero points, and also loss figures 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-off Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
After all, Tappara has dropped in the semifinals in the previous two periods just after the Clave's final series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in group compositions except for goalies.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute today.
With Tapara's goal Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: Ässissa Ässissa kässä kässä käyttön play
Toivola, sports director, wrote an inappropriate sequel to the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the lead.
Sensationally, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy when he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
Unnamed and wooden-handed casserole advanced to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irokes.
Hope child became blonde.
J.P. Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the new work of this period will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for the Ässi has built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pounding guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen's merits lie in something other than playing in the disc.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock with Sean Connery.
Iron Rock in Toivola's manuscript Rocky is as clumsy a lead as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garrett Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karelian on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play with us are the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not a game of ace hockey, and iron rock, which was hot after the game, went off on the Satakunta people.
The team of Ässien this season is strangely built.
There's kids, there's veterans, there's cops, there's guys who want to talk to you.
In practice, there are no key men of the highest age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smudge under the surface.
In the 1953 model, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Aces balance in the three league games of the season has as many losses in goal difference 1-6.
Hopela shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it seems crazy, and the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanna's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly coloured.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become Finland's largest band.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really sad.
There was little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from the notorious skit story of Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday girl and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project doesn't scare him.
It's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Italy often plans to drive home for the sake of their young children because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, simply asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive drama film in Finland
The budget of Timo Vuorensola's film Iron Sky: The Coming Race is 17 million euros.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scif film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
I love going to Belgium.
Just because time is tight doesn't mean there's fear in your ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
But you could shove 100 million into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years' time at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What's the deal with the hillbilly or the cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the Trendsters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
It's times that change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to turn into irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mundane fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by preferring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard collegiate, you're going to put on the sweat shirt that is buried at the bottom of the closet and the manufacturer's logo is shown in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' identifiable trackcoats, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The beginnings of the jeans are the Calvin Klein logos of the underpants, which are now cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sport signs to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's fall sweaters makes it clear what the clothing is.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
There have been colorful claims in recent days in the media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove Zotov of large size from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least, from their images, it's not a matter of getting stuck or angry.
That's a bunch of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained that he had admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, and I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm fat, but nothing like me stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged deadlock have been published, even though 50 000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with the case of Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he struggled out of the tank door to try and finally threaten to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the organisers of the exhibition gave their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevsky Bloknot.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sands tank into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for re-use as process water or, according to the permit, it is discharged through the surface drainage field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material draining into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says that it cooperates closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contractual system and for unemployment benefit.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented within the shortest possible time frame in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects today, in his new cyclical forecast, that growth will fall to zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing slightly in the summer," Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the lack of confidence in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are only a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday," Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat company bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year, among other things, on the OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter website.
The Finnish Immigration Service's Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reasons for this disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who is alone.
The overall statistics on minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been converted?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Secretary's meeting, Orpo, who was discussing refugee issues, announced on Monday the practical steps to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices
Timo T.A. Mikkose's equipment for TV and radio productions is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The online announcement was the first thing that told me about the online magazine Iltamakasini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been overtaken by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam tapes.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested ones.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV or radio equipment of its own anymore.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute in the summer, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether they will extend the force in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says he's a big man on the field.
So the government's plans to cut the sheets raise opposition.
Mrs Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is, however, a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will be virtually completely stopped.
According to VR's records, trains don't run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses stay in the pits.
ACP Members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superiors, HSL's publicist Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell exactly which buses to take on Friday.
Wage and salary earners' organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11 am to 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the Associated Press.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a high school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered his own-made watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News all he wanted to do was show off his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the clock to look like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy may be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether this case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's uproar - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, thought Labour MP Kate Green at a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial was honoured by the battle of British Air Force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
The election of Corbyn as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Among the MPs in particular are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity and increasing public spending.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is due to appear as party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron wrote on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for the family killing in Minnesota is still unclear. The father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was their father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three of his children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found Short's family dead all over a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Mintonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've had 50 takeover bids made in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was shown by the fact that the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow for a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a coffee cake.
In addition, the owner trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Horse Owner of the Month of Hippos.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on his honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and made a profit of 100 000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the success horse gets the full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is going to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest contribution ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's contribution is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening, serve the food with nothing but bikinis and aprons on.
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and the hungry.
There's news from Metro.
You can order for yourself a wife or husband for the evening at the Ore no Yome cafe in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the spouse of a client.
"Half" is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing only an apron and bikini with her husband in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length of the marriage candidates and always puts pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: car security attacks started to take place
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field, says Intel's release.
The Board is made up of top experts in the field of security from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB's research.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimated that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, and it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in its release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European design director, is more round.
An inch into the shafts and outer dimensions of the vehicle and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but it has been added a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to the sales.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, as we will receive the new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the end of the year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The starting point is to obtain Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when they are accompanied by Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
About the same time it's coming in, we're starting to sell Optima Farmer.
Chisu went back to the stage, ranting in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a nice, open neckline in an electric-blue pantset.
The costume presents beautifully the delicate waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on the stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release her new album, and at the same time her fourth one, called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes me again. Now you see the breast.
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives the subjects one after the other.
He presents his pregnant stomach and chest equipment freely in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the lightning lights flash, it reveals the color of the bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black upper knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was in the pregnant stomach.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out of the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you were in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will start with Castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry that compete with old-timers for work.
Models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel and may take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinnyness.
Agent New York may ask you to drop the kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, it's hard to break up.
Models want this sector because of its potential, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that the job is just a showdown of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities, too.
The job makes the models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
The models last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the movie.
Scrooge Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the Apulanta group in the early years.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's okay that I learn his style only from video.
I don't want to do an impression of a person.
A man who leads a band called Scrooge Salminen and Dogs is not going to play the role.
The Punk Manerians come with the man naturally.
I'm sure in the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many people saw a foretaste, the same if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but we always go to the fullest.
In Apulina, Tuukka Temose, who played bass in 1993-2004, released the leading actors of "You Made us Beautiful" film today.
The core group that became familiar to the audience of the band is presented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Timosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about it at all?
There is no need to raise this issue by force, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Younger children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can hang on in their minds and distress them, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth raising the question.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to raise the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how this is viewed in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model for dealing with difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your own strength?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apila's Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was only racing for profit and second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet for his protégé.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two drops of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-tamma after the Tarunwind.
Apila's Pallosalama was under great pressure from the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
With those things in mind, the slight deflection at the end was understandable," says the North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilized.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it's not in the mood, it could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been torn off by such a bolt of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, rivals are unable to cope with the Pallosalama, which even has warm - blooded rides.
There's a race in Vermo.
But the difference is, how does Apila's Pallosalama agree to that?
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the truck and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku leaves.
Apila Pallosalama can also come from the bow when she's okay, and we're going to drive it for victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone features a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks on the face.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications worked closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or by 0.1 per cent from one year ago, as reported today by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
Inflation was 0.2 per cent in July.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat estimated base inflation at 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in Malta in August, or 1.4 per cent of the euro countries.
Cyprus had the lowest inflation rate, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently distant from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year's time, but more assuredly within three years after the country's Central Bank, Fed, takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate squeeze before then.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets do what they used to do - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report over 60 pages to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who drew up the study and report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as in previous interest rates - and what may be the result.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more flimsy state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
♪ Not even a year before the recession ♪
The leaders who decided on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have all over last summer and early autumn hinted that the time was coming to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in more than nine years may already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Directors of Fedi meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points for exactly two years, increasing Fed's interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing financing, and one year later the financial crisis was torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, severe financial market and real economy setbacks started at a slower pace than has typically been the case since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
In most cases less than three years and on average less than three and a half years have elapsed since the beginning of the recession.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has increased its steering rate by a dozen cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects from others, and there is a relatively limited number of times under review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be unquestionably identified even by decades of research.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power, there are three things that are somewhat beyond question:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were patching up the tracks of the techno bubble, and they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the level of debt accumulated and already excessive in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased even more as a result of central banks' over-reliance on monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history until then was born.
3) In particular, the almost unbridled financial economy's craziness in debt financing has swelled the largest exchange rate bubbles from shares in real estate, debt and commodities in most financial markets in the past.
There is hardly a great deal of controversy about the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to a height on increasingly complex debt lines, were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as the last time Fed and the other central banks were pushing interest rates upwards.
The financial structures built on debt bonds, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last more than a while after the interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not guess what is going to happen next, but give cause for alarm by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
( 2) For a long time, debt has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but is now a much heavier debt burden in various parts of the economy than in the past and never before in the past.
3) Liquidity from the central banks, which is more frequent and cheaper than before, has largely remained in the financial markets and has reached the highest levels of key securities and assets, whether at the peak of or never before the financial crisis.
And not only with financial market warnings, they point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its financial stakes.
Maybe the future of Albert Edwards, the future of the French bank Societe Generale strategist, isn't as strange as it seems.
He has been preparing the bank's international investors for Fedi's next round of turns for a long time:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for Fed to run off with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP's business service provider," says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer Pc machines and printers.
HP's personnel peaked in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to transfer its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, said that she was a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timeframe," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs's holdings are carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second largest owner in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the capital of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not subject to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' private equity fund, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first reception centre for adults for asylum seekers maintained by the company.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants already today starting at 6:00 p.m.
The number of places to stay may increase within one week to a maximum of 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative work-related blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmails.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
Mr Palola said that at the moment the attention is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then come back.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday," Palola pointed out during the break of the organisation's administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STK economists have calculated that the security of change provided by the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I do not know whether there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there is a one-to-one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiating link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because the government is then due to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, cutting Sunday supplements is a painful place for staff members at STK Airport.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is carrying out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the TTK does not give a warm welcome to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish Government's blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages of the first days of illness will be cut, overtime payments will be reduced to half, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
It is stressed from the STK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder Thanks you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STTK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government presentations has been outlined in Akava for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be involved in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want security of change and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate a 5% competitive jump in the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Arava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's line, as GTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the willies" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere tonight.
In the past, the prime ministers have given special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go back to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a television speech.
Single phone call, monarchy action.
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day long.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give her speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, Ville Niinistö "one-calling has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP president, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What is the fear of @juhapila?
Public service
According to the Finnish Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts approximately 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
There has been criticism of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote public publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news by Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like We're in Tammelas time ♪
The speech has also sparked blasphemousness.
When the evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
Mom's gonna wear the nicest dress, and Dad's gonna fit his tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television was silenced as before in the days of Me Tammelas," writes the bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capital in tax havens, who make pardon laws for other tax avoidance friends and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state is running out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Are we going to hear about the same boat, the common coal, the debt and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 9:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed al-Assad to give way in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in any case within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points of plan in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be immediately connected with Al-Assad and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told her what I was doing there and she said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats have no comment.
Ahtisaari reports that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreement that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, has doubts about the speeches of Ahtisaari, because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said that even if he did, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power over some Al-Assad supporter.
A River of Refugees From Our Own Works
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, some 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants to työhtö Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of Tornio's joint declaration in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat announced that the Council would have already decided to present the school building as a farm solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present.
13 delegates were opposed to the Organization Centre.
Based on this, one might expect a positive decision," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and a quick response was received.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint statement.
An expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central), the public half of the holiday money would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on this.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for ways to replace the blackmails in the working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the halving of the locusts would act as a means, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
The social partners could agree on a cut in holiday money because they are enshrined in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will be reporting to Parliament next Wednesday on the blackmail of working life as a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if you have the will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and the Helatorista into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are reduced by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
On Friday, because of these activities, wage-based central organisations are organising a major demonstration and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse at Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also somewhat surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided on later in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian Language Places in Joensuu
The City Government eased its previous steep stance to bring street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more of an Eastern Savonian dialect.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for Karelian language use in information boards and tourism marketing, for example, on a case-by-case basis.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth being open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still one of the peculiarities of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both can well be used in the multifaceted marketing of the province.
The closure of rail lines cuts the vitality of the province
Train cuts hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all," says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also points out the issue of air transport, which has also been the subject of several reports.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the chance to reduce our chances of doing so by means of government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen points out.
The deterioration of accessibility poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkrinen, the recruitment manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because of the lack of cross-border connections.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them come from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sotelle
Joensuu City Board's view of the Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
At the Board meeting on Monday, Mr Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented a proposal to abandon the whole project, but his presentation was unsound.
The Board approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of trains.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains is missing, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.

The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of trouble who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at 5:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away and passersby called the rescue department to help the last one safely left on the roof with drawknives back to the surface.
Change in FedEx's turnover, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak performance in the last quarter. Transport giants weakened their performance forecast throughout the year due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that 50 000 seasonal workers would be employed during the holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of its actual trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May.
According to a FactSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will take effect in November.
The company is still waiting for profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in e-commerce.
The president and CEO Fred Smith noted that the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
A day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90 000 to 95 000 people, was announced in the plans for hiring seasonal workers.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which represents an increase of 6 %.
The earnings per share were $2.42 and the forecast of $2.44 for the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research was therefore dropped.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class transmissions, which has caused the company's Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth in e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed the increased costs of large-scale deliveries and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the freight business's return decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opening, FedEx's share price had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of Fed, the Federal Reserve, will meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, and the group will sit down at a wooden table in Honduras of eight metres in diameter to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative, two - story conference room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the State above those of all others.
The Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
After the Great Depression, however, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start withdrawal from the unforeseen stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady economic growth, the recent financial turmoil may already give the prudent central bank's officials a fright to increase volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate by at least one quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market is enough to keep us waiting," Piegza continues.
The questioners do not agree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in the Bloomberg study thought of an increase in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to be waiting and the main indicator is that there is only a 30% chance of raising.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, the share prices may decrease unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second withdrawal.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index leaped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The underlying expectations were that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank were to raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the Central Bank would have to give careful thought to how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets without shaking."
In turn, one of the experts noted that the increase in interest rates could reassure the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening up the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said throughout spring and early spring that he expected interest rates to increase this year – despite the fact that the Liberals say economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month and is now at its lowest level for seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank is reducing to full employment.
Wages seem to pick up
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual targets of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was the severe temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the tight situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , financial markets worldwide did not startle last month when China devalued its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the decline of the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% since May's peak.
The turmoil in the market means that the central bank's decision-makers will become even more complicated to consider the increase in the steering rate.
"The Central Bank's work is becoming more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and what news has been coming from the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
Now he believes the Central Bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the situation in China since the recent developments," Oliner said.
The reorganisation of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern and should, in principle, not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the world's most influential monetary authority.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the Central Bank could reduce its scope caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined; in addition to monitoring world trends, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
The President of the Regional Bank of Richmond said this month that the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements which seem to be unrelated to the fundamental economic pillars.
Mr Lecker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the Central Bank's decision at three meetings to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only limited identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth," Mr Lecker explained.
A year later, the Central Bank overturned the decision.
"The Central Bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching the situation at the time," he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest due to the shock of the market," Peterson Institute for International Economics added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this change comes, I do not think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association promotes a proper diet for breast-feeding women
Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Association (SPRS) has developed a sugary way of teaching breastfeeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breastfed from the breast, painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which gives the baby all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calorie levels, other changes in diet should be made.
A recent study by Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland in Texas revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven Sunrise's got the most viewers, even though Nine's trying to get the lead on his Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson went to Canberra to do a morning programme on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership elections, but that did little to improve today's ratings.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital city after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's morning program for a competing channel was sent from London. Special weekly broadcasts are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance was of no interest to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise had an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, while the Today programme had 339 000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but missed reading last Thursday (343 000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 admissions, Sunris had 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50 000 admissions.
In September Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 admissions and Today 314 000 admissions.
Here's the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had an outstanding novelty series of 800 Words, including the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached a huge 1 219 000 viewers.
Critics have suspected that Thomson would be enough to star the hit series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven The X Factor maintained a strong position with 1,16,000 spectators. The series brightly defeated The Block (838 000) and the TBL Families (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has imprisoned viewers in varying degrees.
An average of 446 000 admissions followed by Andrew O'Keefe from the first half-hour of the new series of quizries (17.00-17.30).
At the second half hour (17.30–18.00), the audience rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 admissions, and the other half gathered a huge 720 000 admissions.
Hot Seat's audience was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night ratings showed on Nine that Hot Seat will pass by at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minutes, who could not challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams – but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markowski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of the Bachelor of Dreams.
The ultimate choice of the bachelor Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
The three remaining women won't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked questions about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they dropped one out of the trio.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were thrilled that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity and considered him to be a suitable partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable companion for Wood, if the last rose did not hit its own surface, their answers may give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood, everything has been easy from the beginning.
"When I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and she is really fun to have," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this wasn't just a race. I'm investing in our relationship now," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she mysteriously replied:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like the other girls as much as you do, and Sneza and Lana are equal."
The bachelor of dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne since she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also took an interest in the man after an impressive day of open practice last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit it.
Some coaches would have held Hayne on the bench, as the man did in the ranks of the Australian rugby national team. Hayne screwed up the kickback after the team took the victory on Tuesday from Minnesota at 20-3.
However, Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight kick, and the coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the locker room after the game.
He wasn't blaring in front of the rest of the team, he was encouraging them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's gonna screw up the capture, the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans had been expecting something else from his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his pitch in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
But overall, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published an Instagram photo of her posing with fans and Australian flags.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at the airport in Siberia.
Mr Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Putin, was convicted, his oil company Jukos was depreciated and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead cops fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal.
Four people died in Southern Nepal, a source of government reported on Wednesday, and the police fired rubber bullets at a mob in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than three hundred kilometres from Kathandus capital.
According to district manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before they fired rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which may kill but are generally considered as a less destructive option, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent conflicts since 10 August,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the regime has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working on since 2008, but the process was speeded up by legislators after thousands of people died in the tragic earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and according to the authorities, the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From a large area of low pressure, about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, 60 per cent of the chances can develop a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, announced the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, Cape Verde and the Little Antilles also have a clear low pressure center, which can also be 60% likely to develop into a tropical cyclone within the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and were hungry, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migration crisis worsened, many families in similar situations are in desperate need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without frontiers, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
When donations have been collected through google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, reaching a total of $11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since the Second World War, which is compounded in particular by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people this year to flee their homes.
There is also a need to escape war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from a obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after a obesity operation than those who receive non-operative treatment.
"Death data takes time," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
By means of a bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have included people who are physically overweight and have a BMI of 35 or more.
Body mass index indicates weight and length with a normal value of 18,5 to 24,9.
When the body mass index is over 25, the person is overweight, and the body mass index of over 30 shows significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to the treatment of mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes.
After obesity surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
The body mass index of non-operative patients remained close to 29.
The overall improvement was 36% and 28% for those treated with surgery.
In the treatment group, the overall improvement was only 1% and in part only about 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
Researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin-A1c levels, which reflect the development of blood glucose levels.
According to investigators, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is less than 7%.
Following surgery, the mean decrease in haemoglobin-A1c from 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
The hemoglobin-A1c level is an indication of control of blood glucose levels. However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the results of two different surgical procedures.
In the fifth year of gastric bypass surgery, weight loss was higher than in the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 and 2.1 %). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes was also completely improved in a greater proportion (46.9 and 16.7 %).
The new study could not show a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery brings years of life to fat people.
In a Swedish study, the incidence of mortality in obese individuals undergoing gastric bypass surgery was reduced by 29% over 15 years compared with the conventional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone nevertheless confirmed that individuals with a BMI of less than 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study because it says that surgery is safe in a lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that predispose obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and he says that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during its visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama gave its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although Mr Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to consider and how we can bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Force has never solved problems," he added.
In his speech on violence, Mr Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the 11 September terrorist attacks and claimed that when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Ingestion of handicraft quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia's Poison Centre, poison centres across the United States report an almost fourfold increase in alcohol-intensive hand-held swallowing in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Centre, the cases reported to poison centres in infants under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children go to emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez says that children drink hand sanitizers on purpose, some to impress their friends and some to encourage social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectants because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol - rich oral water with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the scent of hand-decks.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just perfumed.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavoured handicraft products that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of infants can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength of the hand is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Poisoning at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot within the reach of children, but if hand disinfection products are often left within the reach of children, they quickly produce a large amount of alcohol."
The six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four slobs of strawberry - scented hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult drunk limit," says Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was squirming, and he couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey explained.
"The situation was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol swabs in addition to transferring your hands away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing handicles containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities thought that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as an active substance in the product fiche.
According to a police report, three fourth grade students in the north of New York were planning in January to kill a "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is extremely allergic to handicrafts and refused to bring it into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had gone wrong was meaningless and called for disciplinary action at school.

Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points.
Adam Rooney's first half sentence brought Aberdeen a limited victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five-point flight from Celtic.
Griffiths is underestimating what he says about discord.
Griffiths has ignored the rumors of discord among Celtic's ranks, and according to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch serial leader.

The Dutch miss an old Scottish pair – de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have noted that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic's and Rangers' double struggles.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team leader, said: "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"We don't just talk about the Rangers coming back here.
They're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need team-to-team struggles.
The games of Old Firm have enormous tension and are also interesting beyond Scotland's borders."
I'm turning things around, Deila assures me.
Ronny Delia admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that the situation will change.
The company lost to Malmö fell out of the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," said Delia.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it is a source of hatred or grief for many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, which will significantly strengthen players.
The spirit of cooperation is very important now."
Warburton's careful about January's player transfers
Although it was only a few weeks ago that Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted about January's transfer targets, he was cautious about the transfer rumble and says that he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"The players' transfers in January differ significantly from the transfers in the summer," said Brentford's ex-coach.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been a success in our lineup this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause the team more harm than benefits."
In Celtic's aim, Michu, who is thinking about retirement.
Swansea's attacker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer speeches, while Michu has hinted about retiring after the Swans contract ended.
The trouble with 29-year-old Michu has been a hateful ankle for years, and he was unable to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA on Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson remains behind his words. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was rebuked when he admitted that he had slanderous songs about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region prior to the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee that I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's management team can make things better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy with Hamilton win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to stand up to Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league win, and that winning Aberdeen caught a five-point neck at the top of Celtic's serial board, and that's thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the game.
"There is no Cup or League Winner team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed and 10 000 unemployed in the UK as a whole.
According to the UK Statistical Office (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared with 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
There are 12 000 fewer workers in Scotland than three months earlier; the number of those employed is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter and the average employment rate in the UK as a whole is 73.5%.
The Scottish minister, David Mundell, commented on the recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish for, I will be sitting in the execution room of the state prison in Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January I received an invitation through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I answered yes.
As the day draws near, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought this way I could tell a true story about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than seats, the participants are selected with a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with a man because we've talked on the phone several times over the past few months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my mind.
I was accused on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a doomed story in a way that pleases him, you'll get close to him."
I made a statement to the reporter that I disagreed with him.
The reporter admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still consider my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he'll believe that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware from Huffington Post will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would make him guilty of accessory after the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an objective description of other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
He was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt to escape was bogged down in a shallow, muddy water.
Canning Vale Police received a call on Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they spotted a suspect who tried to shake off the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not attracted to watering the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — negotiation.
"Sometimes, an attempt to escape causes people to resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames the suppliers of Racing Victoria for the espionage attempt on their stables last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to the recent treatment on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to work for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when Lidar's sample found cobalt and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody's been keeping his tongue in check for a year and a half on espionage charges, and he didn't want the accusations to seem like a bitter man's act.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want the owners of the horses to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe in it, I don't think I should continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the integrity department's espionage efforts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him his name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present evidence, for I have not been apprehended for anything illegal.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RFL, David Moody, current President of the RFL, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of the RFL, were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal pursuit?
Should the RFL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the sector on non-coachers?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'll get a training license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt I'll talk to a lot of people about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm putting pressure on them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long - standing study of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection caused the coach to become frustrated in the end, threatening to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the day-to-day rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had been placed in an irregular clay wrapper.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person from my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it did.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to be banned for three months for irregular clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to work out.
"This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands the need for rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Arrested on the scene of the Cobram accident
The police have arrested the man who crashed into the cyclist this weekend, who escaped the scene of the crash.
A cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital and suffered severe injuries after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled the scene and did not stay to help an injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to face charges of failure to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital care and is stable.
The coach of the Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, points to the wrestling speeches of the opponents.
Coach Craig Bellamy of Melbourne Storm considers the criticism of his team's tackle game to be a purpose-oriented action by the NRL's two league favorites.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach Trent Robinson, the judges allowed Storm to wrestle in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night, to the detriment of Melbourne's hosts.
On Saturday night, coach Wayne Bennett of Brisbane Broncos covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifier final at Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model game and said that Queensland doesn't care about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they were only focused on contact when they tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was enhanced by the fact that his team was criticised by two top teams' coaches. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense system or in our techniques all year long. For the last six weeks, we've only invested in contact games and tackles that have turned us into a rise.
Trent's been on a mission for three years, and he may have been shocked to lose because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what is interesting football. She reminded her mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team's game from Saturday to our Friday game and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticism for his boring game. Wayne said that he would not get a drop of criticism.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast backseaters.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player's arsenal is like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're gonna resort to something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the game between Storm and Roosters scored more goals than the encounter between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the end result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. We had more situations, but is it interesting football?
Or is it an interesting football game?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be invited to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in a drug case.
For a 40-pound shipment of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, a man waiting for a possible life sentence has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the police found a hundred kilos of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera port in August.
The police watched the meeting with Maksimovic and his accomplice at the marina this morning, and the two later surprised the Coomera Roadhouse café. A 40-pound shipment of drugs was found in the Toyota Echo car parked at the parking lot.
Although Maximovic may be looking for life in life for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer, there is no evidence that his client tried to take over the whole batch, but the man may have been in a café for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail against which he was released.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both people, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man's escape," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on the condition that he surrenders his passport to both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police daily and stays home from six o'clock in the morning to six o'clock in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and logged into an online message service where he got another user to send unseemly pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing, and she was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
As she looked at the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
From these five images, the police were informed that the computers found at the address were being searched and found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a policeman with the intention of scaring pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson, said in the local court at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation.
He admitted that he did the searches on a computer, but claimed to have done so to represent the police and thus to intimidate the paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When he found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road admitted charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court for consultation on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the delivery of the judgment to October on account of background social work reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is giving the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading up to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe wasn't hurt, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of this House was also overshadowed by the allegations of opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, Members of Parliament booed and interrupted the President's speech on the situation in the state of the country in Parliament, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) bishop, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is entitled "Death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside this House, representatives are no longer subject to immunity.
According to the party's whipper, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and austerity of the business services business.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates the computer and printer business from the faster growing business equipment and service functions.
According to HP's press release, the company will account for $2.7 billion in non-recurring expenses starting from the fourth quarter.
"The new arrangements will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's CEO, who will be managing the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the current HP, and we have a large and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As a company of our own, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company will focus on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies according to its mission.
The company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, raised at Stanford University in the 1930s, is now divided into two companies. The two started an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive restructuring as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
Changes in the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in an area where concentration is believed to be successful.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes according to the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to skip at least the next four England national team games, and, with his history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided last season after a severe ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also said, there may be further injuries when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the ranks of Arsenal in only 65 of the 157 league matches over the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008 six out of eight seasons the team has been the second of the teams that lost most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes the return after injury may involve a vulnerable period of time when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope that he will balance his body. I believe it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal starts his Champions League work on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team meets Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing small changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to take care of the balance of the team and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-Group, Maximir Zagreb is one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been an undefeated 41-game team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground shook at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having had to yield to Monaco. He is also still motivated by the distant hope of piloting the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths of friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially given that men's need to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide statistics are at their highest level for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 a year for men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2 000 high school students were interviewed and the study showed that the chances of healing for those with depression symptoms are better if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The incidence of asymptomatic persons was also reduced by half if they had close relatives who did not have mental health problems.
But it's all based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all taking into account internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values seem to be deeper into our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently stated that money cannot really buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. Ross also often missed Rachel. It was clear that men could relate to this even though they did not refrain from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "As I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. A man is easily regarded as weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of the series that sets out long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside in times of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been brought to life. So if you're participating this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central will send the whole Friends series – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Read the game report and estimate.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the attack when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by beating Malmö at Parc des Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the goal after less than four minutes of debut play. She strengthened the position of French champions in the first hand. However, PSG screwed up several goals before they could finally increase their lead: Cavani painted the game after 60 minutes of play.
The A-section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for an extension in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarter-finals in the three remaining matches.
Although SGG scored the score, the match was not the perfect show for Laurent Blanc's team. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal seat and the man was replaced by his former home club, where the man started his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the league of champions, so the 2-0 win and good grips give us a good basis, even though we still have something to improve on," Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. The team had to settle for 2-2 in the league 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to PSG, was named the PSG's solver, which brings the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of being appointed to run the ball from Marco Verratt's pitch past Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate shot at the rear corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, those who were waiting for the PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players into the field from the start. The team playing with the tactics of five men's defense and two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely missed by Kevin Trapp's goalpost at the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
On the other hand, PSG succumbed to unnecessary pitching and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. At the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the goal to the backseats of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the feed game. At Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal came from the count's time, thanks to Cavan, when a six-way-playing uruguayman shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's catch ended with the second goal, and only the shot fired by Wiland's top fighter David Luiz at close range was controlled, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was rejected at the very end.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that the PSG was in its own class. "We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
I don't think we're going to be able to do the math.
An sensibility for the Parisians.
This was a top-notch match for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in shares.
The Swiss mine giant Glencore, which was hit by the price of raw materials, raised USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of his debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his statement that he had sold some £1.6 billion worth of new shares in order to reduce debts.
The market value of the company decreased by 57 per cent this year. The company wrestles with the fall in raw material prices, as the Chinese economy's economic downturn hampers demand and puts a strain on the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's share price reached the top of the London stock exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 penni in the FTSE 100 index, which opened to an increase of 0.69 per cent.
Last week Glencore announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in equity as part of a strategy to reduce its debt to $30 billion by one third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 pennies, which is 2.4 per cent down on Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of as much as 9.99 per cent of the Group.
The concern over the continuation of the economic downturn in China has caused iron ore prices to collapse by half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House communication of Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be travelling to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives on his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, a return visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between Heads of State and President Obama, the President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, in honor of the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues on which there is disagreement", says the White House Communication.

Matt Damon minimizes diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and found that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to take into account the different views on the project's selected screenplay for the black main character.
"The diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown burst, dismayed and hurt by the claim. "Wow, that's clear," she said, after Damon's comment that starred at the film Alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown were gathered with other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at the outset.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors. Damon harshly replied that the choice of two could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was on TV, the social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct terms: "The fact that Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed over 5,000 times, and it was liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is the number one topic.
After the teenage Michael Brown died from a white cop bullet in 2014. Black Lives Matter received support across the country. The movement seeks to stop discriminatory treatment of black-skinned people by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album candidates of the year at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, the albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter published a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in Fowl News as to whether this group should be described as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," said the management of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether Damon has responded to the invitation in a positive manner.
The first winner in the American Ninja Warrior series
Professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed his winnings for a million dollars.
For the first time all the tasks assigned were clarified during the seventh period that had just ended in the TV series.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the last assignment, men had to climb up a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten cleared the task in the first time given. He was the first competitor to have successfully completed the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race. Caldiero, however, completed the task three seconds faster and won.
Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after he took a million-dollar pot.
"The profit is incredible because I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his jackpot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine the consequences of this, the future is wide open."
Responsible producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to solve all the tasks.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"Of course, the prize is great and will revolutionize life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and do anything more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received much praise from fans.
Britten's a great guy. Family's important to him.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he did not win himself, he preferred to give Isaac the victory.
He also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about him if things had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth period, which will start shooting in spring 2016.

Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against a right-handed old man who had just got back from the injury list in the fields.
"Of course, the beginning was not as I would have liked. As the game progressed, however, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a good job and a few good assists in the third inning," Hughes said.
When Hughes got to the lead, he gave one lair to the second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catcher, J.D. Martinez's free ride, brought Victor Martinez the first race of the game.

"What a hit," commented Paul Molitor, Twins coach.
"He didn't hit very well, but the punch hit the right spot."
The pitch was Hughes, who fed a scoreless third inning, and then he was replaced with a right-handed substitute for A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance was three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight passes.
