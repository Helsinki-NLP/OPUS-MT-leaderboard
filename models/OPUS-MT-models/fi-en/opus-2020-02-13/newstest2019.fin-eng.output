Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane's home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
After seven consecutive men's volleyball Championship medals, Hurricane-Loimaa started the season with a 2018-19 home win, when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned to Finland from Romania, was 22 points the most effective Hurricane.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't come true, and then a call came from Loimaa.
Pretty fast we settled things, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Drumunen, who played in Moimu, supported Kouk by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team chipper with 17 points.
It's always important to win the opening game.
A lot of players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra edge to the game.
Our game is not yet finished, but continuing the medal tube is of course a goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most effective of Savo Volley's 18 points when the team knocked down Vantaa's Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attack head, but luckily we were able to squeeze out the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different download when I played against my former team," Määttanen said.
In Vieremä Volleyball 3 series, Antti Siltala, who started his career in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the ceiling all along.
I left a good feeling at the house opening.
Miro was the king, Silli played a good game too," Tuovinen said.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi in Sampo when Tuovinen was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective Ducks had at 14 points.
Mikkone again star of Aka-Volley
During the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen has started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season's opening win after he knocked down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for itself.
Today, of course, was close to defeat, because we were in the fourth round of defeat between 17 and 21.
We dug up some kind of round win, and the fifth round came along," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective Tigers in the finals had been the chipper Edvarts Builders.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much hold of the guy's chipper, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital world number one
Finland is the world leader in the comparison of human capital," says the magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 lands were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was ranked one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, local game ended with no goal
Real Madrid's goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched to great fights, and the local game of the Madridic teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight back.
Courtois played at Atletico for three seasons on a loan when he was a Chelsea player.
In the early part of the week, Fifa, the International Football Federation, chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, the best score was Gareth Bale, but his shot was directed past the goal at the end of the opening half.
After the break, Bale got traded for a femur injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned fans of Real were shouting the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - A powerful documentary tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected as candidate for election by President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
Many in the Republican Party hope that, with Kavanaugh's decisive vote, the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973, will be overturned.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - the United States and abortion rights tell how the present situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received support from the majority of national MPs at different levels.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been the only abortion doctor in Missouri due to the blackmail of laws.
An armed security guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The interviewed pastor's arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of the abortion itself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
As early as 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to mix religion with politics to catch voters.
His abortion position was also rotated by his successor, George Bush, Senior.
And Donald Trump did the same thing.
The document reaches the deepest point of the matter in its search for a reason for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When discriminatory religious organizations were denied tax exemptions, they became politically active.
They chose abortion as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary ties to politics.
When writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the President, who has boasted of his sexual harassment, but who has captured the voices of the religious right with his attitude to abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by many women, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the status of scales.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations at the border
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip," says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says they've started using force so protestors don't break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March when the Palestinians started the weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12 000 wounded.
The demonstrators called for access to Palestinian families in areas where Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped on kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have set off forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's captain Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a hit from behind in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think it's just a matter of time before Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me the penalty spot, and Mario Vranc hit a 1-0 win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
Work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued the situation to the end.
He created paint situations and defended them tirelessly.
For Norwich, the fight was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's five wins in the back.
Pedophiles' help service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40 000 people in Finland have an interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-school children.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Up to now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood and meeting times were set up very quickly in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy," Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference of children is a source of shame to many.
Most of those who observe pedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
A preference, however, is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of thoughts that distress them and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life," says Yle's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Chore leaders or Congo gynecologist?
As the winner of the American President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound a little strange, but, based on the odds of betting, Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background lies in Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The main favourites of the Nobel Peace laureates are, on the basis of the odds, the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the corals is considerable, as last year there was a chilly gap.
Yet, the reward of Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years, and who leads her country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also be a source of criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, there will be one of the top candidates for the Congo's doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has informed us that there are 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind having a Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him at the White House if he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President went on to refer to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which will decide on the award, has often recognised the people and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require an ideological reversal of the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja, the 1st Street, took place on September 8th.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off as a result of the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are drivers in the road and they're driving however they please, Pasi Kääriäinen, on duty, told STT freshly.
At that time the motorway was even going in the wrong direction only after waiting.
When the first begins to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, the contact manager of Traffic Security, is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not be stopped for any other reason than by force.
Road safety points out that, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible access possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly forbidden, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is of course parking.
In recent times, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow out of his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action," Heiskanen says in the Road Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations, even though the ship was caught in the bottom of the lake.
Ilves fans carried by inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake by its bow," says Juho Syrjä, the master of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off the route late Saturday night and was caught at the bottom in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the field.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and by bus home," Syrja said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's hash was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with debris, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No further impact
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had submerged the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama, as the speed of the ship at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom was not more significant.
According to Syrjä, getting caught at the bottom has not caused leaks or pressure on the ship, and the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning the diver visited to check the condition of the ship before the ship was towed off the shallows.
Just in case, we're still going to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage," says Syrja.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise scheduled for next weekend can be arranged.
The ship's cruise season, according to him, will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services were alerted on Saturday night after just after 11:30.
Ambulances were called into the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Matti Willman, on-call firefighter, told me late in the evening that the conditions for evacuation at the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite a wind.
After 2:30, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on the night before Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The candidate for a Judge of Trump, accused of harassment and drinking, may be out of a top position.
Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well be missing the post he was seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting himself as someone else.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time that the President's candidate for the Supreme Court has caused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for the judge has usually withdrawn himself," says Aaltola.
This has enabled the president to keep his face.
The name would rain on the Democratic laar.
The United States Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but, at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional elections.
It would increase the turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The appointment does not take place for every presidency, since in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
Even Republicans hesitated to be called
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally subject to a background check," says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a week deadline for further clarification by the FBI, Aaltola says it can bring up something essential.
Yeah, it might.
Rarely is smoke without fire," says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for office is still under discussion before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be sceptical about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies the suspected Russian man responsible for Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, she told me that this was Anatoli Tshepiga, a military intelligence officer at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported that they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said that they had found evidence that men's present identities were aliases.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the Russian-China border, where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman living in the village recognized young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the pictures published.
He identified the same man from pictures of the British police who portrayed the man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Script and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's medal in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect's GRU connection.
Earlier in September, men suspected of poisoning reported having been tourists in Salisbury in an interview with Russian television.
Old people in throwing bags in the reform of the social security system
A living example has now been found of what the change limit for the reform of the social security system, as defined by the Sipilä government, means in practice.
My municipality Vaala's social services are provided by the Oulunkaare municipal association, which has been elected as the head of health services in 2016 as the former regional director of Attendo.
The heads of the municipal association warn the council of the change limiter.
If social spending now increases, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre and the small unit of the memory sick.
Home care would be increased, which means in Vaala long distances that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots by the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo trusted that the municipality would pay the customers.
The left of the whale did not swallow poor preparation, but organised a good public gathering with a large number of relatives, carers and also delegates from other parties.
I introduced the diaries in the preparation of the social welfare area, how the elderly are already treated at home most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councilman named Carina Westinen.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it brought Oulunkaaren draftsmen back to their feet.
Sote preparers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
Preparatorys only talk about a service voucher, but do not tell what level of care it will give or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice treatment.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the facilities at the health centre are discontinued because there is no doctor's night emergency services.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how downtown officials run delegates with incomplete information and put their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party clears out of the people of Vaala, because who stays there unsafe voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was it one of the ballots in downtown that the whole country was kept inhabited?
President Erdogan of Turkey opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people demonstrated themselves when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened up one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered by the river Rhine since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the protesters' signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday several demonstrations have been held and the security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered near the Great Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and felt that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations with the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
Mr Merkel stressed, however, that there were deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
The Review Surrounds the Visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, reported that he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people were charged with the murder of Kucik and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week the police arrested eight people in an investigation of the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders had something to do with Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelians in scattered settlements on Sunday
Due to the fault of printing, Karjalainen will also have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in diffused areas where the distribution of common boxes is carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra stacks of magazines in the county.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be sent separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be severely delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala in his upcoming discussion program.
Vesa is in the studio about her upcoming space trip she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan to be paid.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014, which claimed the death penalty, things will be in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, which means that his journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also has a background in his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw Star Trek on TV.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's where the thought of it lingered.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its lossless course in the Champion League when it fell on its home field on Saturday with Brighton's 2-0 paints.
The sixth victory of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by the paint sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth shot of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at the back of Brighton's goal for 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling saw Brighton's defense to pieces in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to place the 2-0 final readings on the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, the season-started City will lead the Champion League with 19 points in catch.
However, the less played one game, Liverpool is only one point away.
Liverpool will meet in his seventh round match on Saturday night in series three Chelsea.
New decision-makers were selected by youth clubs in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Associations chose new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021 at their meeting that ended on Sunday.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected president and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected vice-president.
The Board of Governors was elected 40 members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations informs on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths," says the Finnish Youth Society in its release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was amazed at Ferrari: "Missing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told us that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional. A fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has told me earlier that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming about Formula One, I played F1 all day on PlayStation.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sectional.
At 2:00 p.m., the race begins with Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes.
The evening paper follows the race at the moment.
Football's A-Young Championship Championships became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the 13th round, the starting point for the championship struggle was clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough for the first stage to score against Vasa IFK.
In order to change the situation in the last round, Ilves, the second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the Gulf.
In practice, however, the Lahtin championship was confirmed before the start of the competition, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vases, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won 16-0.
At the break, the Bayers led a 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players is that the team has played partly with the same players the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Two-Stack C.
Vasa IFK has been playing in Number Two, practically against the fall of the season.
In the final round on Saturday Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in the guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Toivala, Lake Siilin.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno. According to the rescue department, luck was involved.
A passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof at Eno's Case Danger on Sunday around 9 o'clock.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the Rescue Department reported.
Well, good luck was in it. It says in the release.
According to the Rescue Department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of intelligence: Equipment acquisition and recruitment already done, no foreign planning of operations
According to Supo's chief, Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million would be added to the budget of the Supon.
The protection police (supon) premises in Ratakakatu, Helsinki, are already preparing fully for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Peltari, Consultant Chief of Supo, tells the media in the West that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing topless campaigns to raise awareness of breast cancer.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is turning on again.
Now he's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts," says AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit by the Australian, The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted for The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to carry out regular self-checks [chests]," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this placed me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do so because the subject affects all women regardless of the color of their skin throughout the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
The Divinyls song is written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the comments on the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a stir at an open US tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams became angry with the chief judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted for far more violent behavior than women's players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for high-feared people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang, China.
It is literally located on the cliff.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
Steady scenery in heights make restaurant visitors yawn their breaths in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike around the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
The comments on Youtube wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is.
Hiking to a restaurant requires good basic condition, the location is told.
The Korpela alley runs out today: This is how it all ends
All good things will come to an end.
Today, this is what happens to domestic country drama, the Korpela alley, which has been quite liked.
The third period of production has gone like hot stones: last week the episode was watched by 722 000 Finns as a first performance on television.
The peaks in themselves are no longer of practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to continue.
In the final episode of Charlie and Mirku's relationship, we're taking another big leap forward, and I think Charlie's mother is the first to guess what's coming.
The relationship between Anssi and Misa is also warm, in the light of recent events, in fact romantic, but then once again there appears a Skinny.
Even the police are skeptical about a man.
Yet no one can predict the fate of the Squirrel in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear incredible news.
The last will of the distance will come out, which will bring a woman to tears.
In a week's time, Sunday evenings will resume in Sorjone.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow for a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
There are lots of lottery tickets to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small," says the Prevention release.
So you think it's worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may be infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when your cough eases and there's no fever anymore," says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to return to the gym will slow the recovery.
And don't forget to wash your hands, blow on your handkerchief and throw your snotting papers in the trash.
Painful to move, though?
If you have to leave your home when you are ill, consider wearing a mask.
The mask doesn't control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezings are also limited with the mask.
How, then, can you avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the beauty tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
A hockey player and a Miss are often linked.
This also happened with Alina Voronkova, 23.
In 2018, Alina Voronkova, a native of Pertunmaa, was appointed as her weaver for Miss Finland's crown.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Inkerinsuomalainen and father is Russian.
My father's Russianism, Voronkov, was bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all," Alina says at the semifinalists' launch of the Miss Suomi competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty found new friends, and the ark set out to roll as desired.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After a career in the SM league, a hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived for almost a year at a distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning three and get a career with it, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about the distance is that it is the spark that keeps up all the time, Alina grins in May.
With continued growth with joy, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's endurance.
Still, there's not much you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but the theory of moderate economy also encounters major problems.
In a few generations, continued economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-standing overbearing capacity of the earth and climate change are causing this market economy to waver in a threatening way.
Two men were stabbed on the night against Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitrator at 4:00 in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured by stabbing, and another, born in 1968, was less severe.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have caught one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
Events are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Interin's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the score of the match at 1-1 by 78 minutes.
Silvelholt was able to get through the right side and successfully lift the ball over the goaltender Henrik Moisander.
With the guest saber game, the Maarians reached the difference to the Turku Ball Society on the spot.
Important goal and valuable point, summed up Mariehamn's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not get into the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily, the goal of the Turks brought us closer into the game.
According to home team Inter's head coach John Allen, the game was under control, but the goal was again painful.
One defense error took away our full pointer. Allen was sorry.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland has ranked number one in the comparison of 195 countries.
The survey measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it with human capital.
Finland was ranked number one in a study that measured the health and education of citizens and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation exists in Africa.
The countries of the continent took the seven worst positions in comparison.
It's Niger.
It was first told by the STT.
Lehtar showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehtää's strong underpower play came up when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and the Widow baited Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehtar's been on display because of drug suspicions.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug group where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
The cow has denied having committed a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, the editor of Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely followed the Flyers, estimated that Lehtar belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a seat in the NHL team.
In the training match, Lehtar was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehter fought the puck for himself with underpower, pulled the defenseman on him, and baited Raffl, who had been waiting in front of the goal, into the open space.
For the second time, the two men's cooperation was the goal at the very end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th in a foreign game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching team to decide if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now it's up to the coaches to decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Librare said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
In the riverboys, Librare, who had his hockey lesson, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
On Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and turned down 20 times.
Flies-based defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by defender Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested, among other things, Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koski.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played for over 20 minutes and pitched the goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's comfort goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 reels with the goal of losing.
Just over 180 000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the questionnaire on the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered more than 180 000 responses.
There is still less than a couple of weeks to reply to a survey opened in Otakanta.fi.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as the other Nordic, Baltic, Central Europe or Western Russia.
The latest picture shows the change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories worth of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos at its largest.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before the title was won, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be of this size," Hall said.
The British hunted the most powerful man in the world with all the means at their disposal, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen at the 2018 world's strongest man competition in April.
In Instagram, Hall recently published a picture of him posing in a much thinner condition than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he's working out five times a week now, aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic, Hafér Júlíus Björnsson, who is familiar with Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the rocks in Pyhäjärvi - "Standardly caught"
Inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday night in Lake Akaa.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident Friday night after 5:30.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks," says firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship was carried by 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the Rescue Department, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been able to evacuate the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere," said Chief Officer Jari Nieminen to STT after one o'clock in the night.
Ambulances were called into the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route west of Jumusensalmi.
The police are trying to figure out what happened.
Matti Willman, on-call firefighter, told us earlier last night that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite a wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently a restaurant vessel with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
The ship also has a meeting space for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The frozen air is passing away - see today's weather forecast here

Ex-managers demand rewards from Robert Helenius.
Boxer Robert Helenius' fight tonight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a financial dispute.
The evening Sanomat announces today a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius will be charged a total of over 80 000 euros of unpaid manager fees with interest on delays.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila says to Evening Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a response to the Evening Journal, which tells the boxer's view of events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in an economically difficult situation and had promised to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It had been agreed, literally, that Helenius was obliged to pay only a percentage of his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay for anything, just receives their income.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed and it would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation," Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not arrive at the draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was bad for himself and that the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen was cut off.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been allocated an "indeed but substantial" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers the ex-post activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, says the response.
Helenius is facing the IBF heavyweight challenger list in the seventh Erkan Teper Stuttgart.
A Hearty Man and a Good Journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The plotner's obituary was published at the Helsinki Sanomat on Sunday.
The ad says Päll died September 3rd.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the fate of the acquaintance.
He said goodbye earlier on Facebook, as it were, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio thinks Erkki Pälli is a multi-talented expert who turned out to be a great journalist.
He remembers Päll was a liked person with fast pitchers and fun things.
I got to know Erki when I was a little boy when I first went to Finn album at 12 and started there as a stockman.
Erk and I met back then.
At the time, he was Finn levy's communicator and he was in various positions," says Ile Vainio.
When I went to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the parties doing stories about artists.
He was always expert, and I saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many he became known as a respected Yle radioman, but he also wrote wonderful articles in the papers.
Erkki interviewed me several times too.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje at Fazer record company in addition to journalistic work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
The biggest passion, however, was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became known to numerous listeners in Yle's Aether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the annual period that ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as a 'full turn', although the economy is, of course, burdened with 'significant debt in the balance sheet'.
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
Careful planning and financial management have been introduced throughout our organization," Kulmala explains in the release.
We have also succeeded well in the acquisition of partners, and in addition, the world cup yield was maximum during the past season of competition.
However, cost management must continue to be rigorous and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was the silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital's backyard in the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of the people in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Paluan Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses just one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
In the courtyard area of the army hospital in Palu was Dwi Haris, injured in his back and arm.
When the quake began, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to a wedding party in Paluu.
I probably got squeezed under a wall that collapsed.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe, Haris told the AP, according to the British media.
Small Shops Stolen
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old baby's mother at the Palu Evac Centre, tried to calm her fevery baby.
He described the moods in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere," Kusuma said.
Many of Palu's inhabitants have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house is still standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it forever and bury the inhabitants.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in Palu's prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped," says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards had forbidden them to leave to search for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land was the army's C-130 transport, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land on the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the tower was badly damaged in an earthquake.
Rain sweeps across Finland at night
On the night against Sunday a long rainy area is spreading across the whole country from the west, says the Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in central and northern Lapland sleet or snow is expected.
The frosty temperatures of the night before are not repeating because under the cloud blanket temperatures remain higher.
The cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures in place quite efficiently.
In the west, we can visit the cold for a moment," said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area takes a turn toward the east during the morning.
South and west are pouty or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu about 10-13 degrees.
The early week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typical weather in the autumn.
That fall is really starting to push on now, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final is not seen on TV
From IL-TV you can follow the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
Tonight's entertainment journalists broadcast live on IL TV from the red carpet of Miss Suomi's finals from Billnäs's cargo.
The broadcast starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned with ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final is held at Billnäs's Ruukki in Raasepori.
Before the finals begin, you can follow the atmosphere from the ground on IL TV live.
Live broadcast starts at approximately 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented in the jury by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other members of the jury include Jutta Gustafsberg, a welfare entrepreneur, Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, Managing Director of Joun's Store and Katja Lintunen, news producer of Seiska.
We were hoping he'd get to college before we went to the Missile Games.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana from India believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova were proud to follow her daughter's first moments in the crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before she came, she got nervous, and she laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was more interested in acting when she was a kid than in Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
The parents hoped that Alina would be admitted to the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to finish the Kandi degree before the Missile Games.
We asked him why he didn't participate last year, but he wanted to finish that kandi.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, you can see it.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey in Japan for a living, and he did not get to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the youth relationship lasts a Miss Year.
Yes, that's the idea!
His parents hoped that his daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break since I've been here because I'm a Miss.
I'm already missing you, even though they've been sending me messages.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti. The police arrested three people.
According to the police, three people have been apprehended as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of events and the possible intent of the hit-and-run on the basis of the incompleteness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the apprehended persons and the man who died in the hit-and-run knew each other from before.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Pippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic nonsense once left my husband's statement in which he suggested it as a person for the story I developed," says Sari Pippo, an Espoan comic blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Pippo says that she was an economic and legal translator in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've really enjoyed being a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me, what would you do when you were growing up when even the smallest child started to be big?
Then in 2014 a comic book came into the picture.
The pipe tells us that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint and Asterix since childhood.
The last time I had drawn was when I was a child, but when these organic manuscripts began to emerge, things changed.
At first I made some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I couldn't lure her into it until summer 2016, when I used the board to bribe her.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strippers, and then I had to start trying myself, laughing Pippo, who tells me that the record was a great incentive for him.
The board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, says Pippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop up in my head all the time, but I don't usually finish at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd be happy to play with the colors.
It's always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing isn't my strong suit.
Sari Pippo says that he appreciates the modern comics of newspapers, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The organic characters are a mother with a carrot body who has a salad bush.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the show come from your own life and social media.
Sari Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer to make a fuss, even if it's between organic nonsense and intrusiveness.
The pipe tells us that it reads its series with its husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at a comic book you're drawing and you're like, "This is what I've done today."
And there's plenty of challenges for a housewife!

Another €20,000 victory goes to Vantaa S-Market Tikkurila for the winner who played with the Veikkaus card.
One was caught by a Vasana online player.
The Indonesian earthquake: the air traffic controller sacrificed himself, didn't leave a crackling tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until he was able to escort hundreds of passengers safely off the earthquake - stricken island.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck Friday.
While others fled the tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before he could direct Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The tower was shaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the FAA told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to increase after the flight reached the air and was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Mr Rehn wondered about Europe's conclusion to the trade war: "You have to look at the following tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own estimates of economic growth.
In Yle's first morning President Olli Rehn said that while tension does not have a direct impact on Europe's trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is so far very much a talent.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has helped to calm the situation also with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be going through a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also faces its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
The market reacted violently yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and unstructured loans account for more than ten per cent.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps there is no point in painting yet new crises, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is Britain's separation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be settled.
A dispute would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just over a year's time.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included," Rehn said, adding that he will not comment further.
HS's super popular Black Box shows will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23 The Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers present on stage during the evening tell a long-standing story that has not previously been published in any of the HS media.
There's something in there again that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from across the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS editors and photographers and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular since the beginning and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already been to the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
Prize winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The content of the presentation to be seen at that time is different from that of the evenings of this autumn.
The missing mushroomer was found because of an "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is the world's top: "We are being asked for training"
According to the principal of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, police can use drones in addition to searching missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the police of Oulu managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Raahe with drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the head of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also at the forefront of the world."
Drone's a brand-new piece of work, and he's even more recent on police duty.
Nowhere is there any statistics that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest elsewhere," says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to see the Finnish police's drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Even now, drones are being used in police missions a great deal, and their use is becoming more widespread and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says that the police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence missions.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, where there is perhaps a fear that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary inquiries.
Karelian Rugby ascended to number one divariate
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2 division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuers were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot during the second period and they left the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelian Rugby had a historic rise to the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played first, but at the time Finnish rugby's serial activities were divided into two levels, the SM series and several segment 1 divisions.
The club is going to take the show place, but it's going to be quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be consistent with it.
Eagleniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The head coach Claude Julien of the Montreal Canadiens at the NHL confirmed on the club's Twitter account that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round number three at the summer reservation.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has played a strong role in the September training matches.
The Eagleniemi was able to score the goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finns for taking big developments after arriving at the camp.
The NHL regular season starts next week on the night of Thursday.
Montreal faces the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week a lot has been said about leadership in Finland.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, reported on his book Paranoid Optimist, where he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia studies have also mentioned the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking ability and agility of the company's upswing phase disappeared.
During the week Nordic Business Forum was also organised in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business stars rose to the stage.
There was enough talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of leadership doctrines, said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods store chain known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate with the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book on introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are studied to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager should coincide with the life cycle phase of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that's grown into a mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of having a piece of information.
It takes a lot for a good leader.
That's why management goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They used to talk to each other in front of each other like a friend.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived at the red carpet in a fantastic way from Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a laced drag.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's doing.
Chafak says he's auditioning in L.A.
Among other things, he's been doing ad shoots.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he said that more work needs to be done, as there is always a replacement for model work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30,000 Euro Live Art Prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30,000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art award winner Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments that they have previously addressed, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for: "We can't tell you where."
The extensive search of the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlan was closed in Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
I.S. reached out to the chief of staff at the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
They found the car they were looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henry Storm of the Copenhagen Police Department will tell Evening Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Extra Bladet of Denmark told me about the police's Saturday press conference.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime he was working on.
But Skov told me it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to human life.
We've been looking for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also watched the events on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the public has no cause for concern, as certain people were threatened.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disunity - now the people are voting in controversial elections.
In Macedonia in the Balkans, we are currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of Northern Macedonia would be named.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote took place slowly, at least at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, wanted support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for young people," he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been officially designated as an independent Macedonia since 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough tension as to whether the turnout will rise above the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the 'yes' votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed for the amendment of the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also still has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
That's a handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night at a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
Tonight's main match was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to compete on Saturday's harder tasks, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand punch.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met for the first time in the ring.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the fight.
Then it turned out that the German had been burned twice in a drug test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with a stable order to win - break up with Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship came close again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won Russia's gp and stretched his World Cup scoring lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five cats left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole seat in the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who won his career, held the lead in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton go.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The two of them assaulted a jukaman in Joensuu. They got caught a block away.
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6:00.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man in a haystack, and a 39-year-old man in a Homomantsi block, shortly after the incident.
They were apprehended as a suspect in a robbery, police report.
The victim suffered bruises that didn't require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The SEC has accused Muski of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting time to reach peace with the United States of America.
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sundays and their negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations at full weight.
At the request of President Donald Trump, about a year ago the United States, Canada and Mexico opened negotiations on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
Neighbor thought the candles were slicing into a fire in Kakkuri. The fire department was alerted to the scene.
The candles burned in an apartment apartment in Kaakkkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue services were alerted to a possible fire in an apartment building.
On the spot, it was discovered that the candles burned in the apartment sauna had looked like a fire across the street from the house, which was why the emergency room had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
The police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK game, ranting in the field and at the subway station.
The police caught eleven people on Saturday after the Men's Football League's Honka-HJK match in Espoo, and Teemu Värtinen from the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The grounds for arrest were protection against crime and disturbance.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down," Värtinen said.
The arrests were reported earlier by the Evening Sanomat.
The fight ended at 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed into the field from the audience reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between the supporters of the teams.
Among other things, cavalry officers were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, there was a brawl in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the catchers also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the incident in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
The table stone slid the butterfly swimming in its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Stone have progressed to finals on the closing day of World Cup 3/7 in Holland.
We're going to swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS Tablestone hastened Finland's record for 50 metres in butterfly swimming, where he was second in the early 22.82.
Earlier in September Table stone swam in Helsinki during the SE season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24.68 in the 24th time of butterfly swimming.
Swimming Club Vuokatti's Laukkanen was 30.48 in the early 50-metre breast swim in the sixth period and advanced to the finals.
In the early two hundred meters of mixed swimming Laukkanen was in the 15th time 2.14.25.
Students perform a rare treat: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia is influenced by its visualism
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
The National Theatre, for example, has last seen the ancient tragedy of Sofokleen Filoktetes in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour of the National Theatre the only drama trilogy of ancient history, Aiskylus Oresteia.
In the Lavat open! projects that started in 2015, the actors students of the Theatre University work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Orestea, the international premiere, was held in Berlin in April.
Roihan's agreement on Orestea sums up the story of the death of the doomed Atreus family's blood vendetta and the birth of the rule of law to one hour and twenty minutes, especially by intensifying choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simoni's great translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the revealing presentation of the theatre space highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between the performers who break out of the choir and the performers who play name roles.
Both double and triple seats are used for the performance.
Actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the war in Troy, and his spoils, Cassandra, are shown on the scene, contrary to the tradition of the ancient tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress its loyalty to ancient tradition.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is being created before the viewer's eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring up a rhythmic group of Master's degree actress students as a close group, just one organism.
Especially in choir sections, very expressive, sculpture-like group formations yielding actors to their rights on a bare stage, only decorated by a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new features are beginning to emerge in Europe, particularly thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai supplies a thousand car batch of new models for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell-driven truck on the market, Hyundai will continue to use Nexon and ix35-Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network," said In Cheol Lee, Hyundai Motor's Vice President at the release of the contract.
The fists flashed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30 ' s abused three men in a restaurant in Kajaan city center and outside it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser struck him.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to jail to calm him down.
The case is being investigated in three forms of assault and violent opposition to an official.
There was also another assault on the middle of Kajaani street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaan man struck the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him earlier kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigation.kainuu@politi.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, we're good.
Even the doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of store aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I received a salary for a newspaper article.
When you're surprised about something you're talking about on these rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karyan, September 27) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even at times a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähäraa, working environment expert of the Service Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers naturally claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly perceived as serious and many of the real violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to record their near-miss status under the Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, the problem has always been that physical injuries are not always caused.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level have to be counted as violence - even if there is no attack.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though there is no actual act.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got guards.
As store opening hours were released, the media was also showing a lot of its effects on the sellers' safety.
"At that time, quite a few employers provided security services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When security kept the disturbances well under control, the impression was that security would be unnecessary.
Many places are now trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a crime committed by the plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was abused does not wish to request an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the shop.
However, according to the same paragraph of the 2011 Act, minor abuse will become a matter for the prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused in the store, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court put a couple of abusers in prison, and the sentence from that harsh end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost day and night in small towns must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
Miss's coronation is not seen on TV this year, but is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host came and told the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this guy we're dealing with. Sohlberg was cheering for his colleagues while the crowd was cheering.
Many of the previous years' Miss Finland will follow the rowing contests.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction or the other.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg was looking at the Saras.
Most likely, Mr Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
It's the first time a guy talked about his divorce in the evening Sanomat magazine.
The missikaunotar told me that she doesn't want to open up the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because that's between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not busy with a new relationship. He's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marital status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The juniper was laughing at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the mistake.
The baseman tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes committed against his common-law spouse.
Among other things, a belt, cable, and bundle ties were used as a means of committing crime.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the State.
The most serious charge involved a suspect in a aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty, and two acts of injury were attributed to the Kokolan.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last act, the man was apprehended and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in prison in Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
A 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivations of liberty and a serious rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven.
The case was handled in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public report on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his or her spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he or she had been bound.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
By its judgment, the court ordered the State to be confiscated of criminal equipment: belt and cable, bundle ties, bathrobe belt, knife and pruning machine.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the two parties continued to live together.
It can be read in the order that a large proportion of the most serious crimes occurred at the end of the criminal cycle.
Four Witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old person must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
That is hardly the money he has, since the sentenced person already has debts in recovery.
The prison sentence is not his first.
The evening paper doesn't mention the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district court sentence is not valid when you write this.
Europe leading four-point Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their lead in a traditional punch match against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup, which is playing around Paris, with a score of 10-6, while twelve doubles are still playing on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of the four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-ball game, the winnings were equalized by 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the duo will pursue more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and there are only three of the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka game: "Voice is not part of football"
The football betting league team, HJK, published a release on Sunday condemning the disorderly behaviour of its supporters at the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We are sorry for what has happened since the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the fight, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The orderlys were not able to calm the situation down, but needed police officers and also cavalry officers.
In his announcement, HJK tells us that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old society.
"We are categorically dissociating ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the press release states.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to identify threats to security and to eliminate minor occurrences.
Proponent culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyous and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not a part of it," says the press release.

He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who swears to have invented a flying car... or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his property building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight, and he flew his device at altitudes of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will give rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow's industrial action will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors tomorrow, the bans on overtime and shift change will be particularly visible in social services, health services and day care for children," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be widespread and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened," says Niemi-Laine to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift change due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to employ staff but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is only normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies against dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market manager of municipal employers, does not make a preliminary assessment of the effects of the bans on overtime and shift change.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so wide-ranging, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week there was already experience of three days of similar activities, such as those carried out by the Association of Local and Founding Nurses Super and the Trade Union Union for Social Affairs and Health Tehy.
Their effects were rather limited.
The JHL's ban on overtime and shift change applies to employees in municipalities, church, state and private social and health care sectors.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100 000 JHL members are involved in the industrial battle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's activities may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Employment Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is where we run into the wall and hard.
He believes that both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
The strange thing is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been made, Jalonen updates.
The great coral reef is born with the power of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show, they study the gestures of skates and seahorses.
The Great Coral Reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is a lot of fairy tale-like magic for the children's participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the great coral reef is not a child show but a performance that adults and children do in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations about how children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The large coral reef is a bit like fairy ballet, fitness district and nature-related information, but it is finally tuned around the visits in other, non-human environments.
The large coral reef begins with the introduction of corals and coral reefs to the motion courses of living organisms and fish.
In six different exercises, the gestures of skates and seahorses are learned.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour's length will be performed in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being considered.
In addition, there are coral - looking organisms.
Views and observations in many directions make the performance dense and life - stricken.
Whether to be a landscape of an organism, a landscape - looking organism, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism, and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem that hard.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limits of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitratori will host a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
The destruction beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it might be difficult to grasp the significance of exercising one's own compassion in front of the sights of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and play it will clear up.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smart phones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth grade sister on the weekend at the "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is a grown-up thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a proper childhood and do not need to grow up too early because of group pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram, wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send revealing pictures.
It's even harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and even parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smart phones in my childhood.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people would think of me.
Yle: Authorities informed the government that the Airisto Helmi case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protection police and the defence forces visited the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish administration has been informed that the investigation of Airisto Helmet is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Yle's Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (OK).
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else," Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
To date, there has been no evidence of a link with national security, but the investigation is still under way.
There is no way of knowing what can be revealed there, says one of Yle's interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches started in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland raised the question of whether the investigation is simply a financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening paper compiled an article on arguments both for and against.
Video: Dream paint saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100 percent Champion League was completed, but it was still a more satisfied team for 1-1 tie on Stamford Bridge.
Sunday is exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combination sent a signal to the whole Valio League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool's manager Jörgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Champions League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to be in control of his own field end alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had Wednesday's great league cup victory on Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a fantastic performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was with us from the very beginning.
At the 25th minute, he first played a triangular game in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard dive forward and sent him a fully weighted pass through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but from there he bombed the perfect left leg bet at the bottom corner.
Pool's brass guard, Alison, was a little slow in his fight and all he could get was his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the position of defeat lightly unfair, because almost immediately after that Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's direction from the finish line.
During the second period, Chelsea Veskar Kepa also got real action.
The Basque watchman reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into an angle kick.
At the other end, Alison, by throwing herself through Hazard, zeroed.
The best place for guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the Brass Star's bull was directed toward the national teammate David Luiz, who saved the leadership of the hosts.
Even that could not last another 89 minutes when replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot for 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and in honor of that, the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 tie, but it's still on the league tip together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
At the time of the clock transfer debate, the potets are deep.
I remember a few decades ago, a magazine asked various Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer remained the only one left in mind: the Nen terminal.
Some people's last name has a nun ending and some don't.
I mean, there could be divisions anywhere, and there was one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of the annual shift of clocks.
Very many agree that the shift of clocks twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement at least seems to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide at what time we will end up at: the present summer or winter season or some other time zone.
This also gives people the opportunity to express their opinion on the otakanta.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
There is a heated debate on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a word to say.
The defenders of wintertime justify their position with the effect of morning light on the well-being of people and summer time by the effect of evening light on people's desire to walk and thus on well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light rhythmizes man's day and gives freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase the movement of people outside and give you better opportunities to work in the autumn yard, for example.
The number of additional lights after a normal working day has already been calculated to class.
I'd rather have both, but unfortunately for our location in the northern part of the earth, there's nothing we can do.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of the debate on this subject that one's own view is being pursued and the other's view is being strongly opposed.
You don't listen to the arguments of your opponent much, because the most important thing is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, there is little point in trying to turn the other person's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require great dedication and it is enough to justify the mutation.
Similar issues are generally the most controversial and equally infertile.
Well, it's a shame if the wrong option comes up, but I think it'll fit in.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close guest victory.
Josba's first guest game at the gym band in Divar produced a full three-series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
The 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
When both teams were on hold, crucial minutes were played at the flat.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was already firepower when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played at the time of her goal in chain two.
Josba's got six points after three laps.
Next up comes O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Uncle's Church Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the uncle's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in some very sad moods.
A week ago, the arson of the church in the face of the threat of heat was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wanted to, Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite the municipal and other connections of the world.
Family Mass starts at Eno's church today at 10:00.
After that, we move to the parish hall by the Karelian banquet table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building with Ari Räsänen, who has retired for 37 years as parish master.
The celebration of the church's birth also marks the end of an era.
The church house, built in 1982, has already been decommissioned for the last time today.
Now we are in evasive spaces at the old municipal hall," says Markku Koistinen, a chaplain.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the chair of the Tesla government - The charges of fraud were settled for $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, have settled their case with the SEC, the US Securities Market Supervisor.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he created.
But Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to step down from the chair of the Tesla Board for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent directors and to monitor Muski's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The Suite temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the television was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential sponsors.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that they would sue the company and Muski.
The SEC stated that it demanded that Musk be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC's challenge frightened the investors, and Tesla's stock went into a sharp decline.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia's quake and tsunami
The number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the National Disaster Bureau, according to AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as the damage is still to be solved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Immediately after the quake, Tsunami was given a warning, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being from Prausa.
The emergency services are concerned, among other things, with the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to die.
Haronous Calls for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the disaster site today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work day and night.
One of the central points of the rescue work is the Palu hotel, which is still believed to have between 50 and 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syagi, head of the rescue agency, reported that one person could be dug up alive in the night from the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular for business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, heavy grubbing equipment would be needed quickly in the earthquake and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you guys in Palu and nearby.
A friend of mine's family is still missing. One writer appealed to Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts were leaked because of shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The troublemakers had access to the telephone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party Assembly in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the politicians' profiles in the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The person signing in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment to a porn image and title to insult.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by a photo of a media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the loginer can view the profile person's contact details and send messages in their name.
The meeting application made every journalist, politician and participant's telephone number public," Foster criticized.
The Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
British information agency ICO supports the leak.
The application was made by an Australian company called Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in matters of security.
There are a large number of applauding Poles in the audience of The Wall Suomi every week
The close-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Suomi.
The fast-spread American format The Wall landed in Finland last Saturday at Number Four.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high wall of the format required space for the farm.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the studio audience of the program, which was believed to be Polish.
On Twitter, the discussion was about whether the Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game that is being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programs in Number Four, illustrates the matter to the Evening Magazine.
He says that the studio audience has close players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international patters in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programs," says Sormunen.
He reminds us that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling off the wall.
For foreign-language speakers, however, there are interpreters in the studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret what happens to the studio director as a simultanic interpretation.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap they throw there, for example, and what the situation is going on," Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with that of David Hasselhoff in domestic production the other day.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the shoots of Talent Finland at our home in Finland.
He was constantly getting simultanic interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was said in the illustrations in Finnish, the sum of the Sormune.
The typhoon in the southern parts of Japan is moving towards the main islands - the authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and so far there is no record of casualties.
On the southern island of Okinawa the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated to shelters and power has been cut off by over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in places at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
Tokyo, the capital, is not directly on the path of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to the weather scientists, Trami is tormenting Japan until Monday.
♪ The sky of ♪ ♪ The sky of ♪ ♪ The sky of ♪ ♪ The sky of ♪ ♪
It's been a bad early season.
The sky was darkened almost as soon as the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Poris now have five consecutive losses, and the score for the six rounds is a total of two.
No Ässian defender or two lower chain players have scored yet.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
As far as Sport was concerned, almost half of the game was left in the hall.
Six games have just been played, and there is, of course, no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that's the least we could do.
In particular, the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the Äss 1+2 power.
Sport had a natural taste for victory.
The team had a game under Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible in making it.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of bread-day visitors continued to increase
The bread day mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall.
Somehow you thought maybe this year there wouldn't be this many people," Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor's Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, this was the case; the corridors were already well blocked before ten, the sellers reported that the products had run out, the news oatmeal was sold more than before, and even in the number of cars, Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000," Hyvärinen explains later in the afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon five hours there was a particularly large amount of program for families with children, which may have attracted them to a record high.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach a further distance.
Salesmen also turn to Liper each year from a larger area.
This year almost a hundred rapporteurs, craftsmen, bakers and harvesters had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The bread day mother, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won an audience vote.
Eleven different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the Rye Bread Competition, spent the day at the Martian Pie Workshop.
7 x most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without getting tired of the eyes.
It's worth a shot at a good light.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do Your Eyes a Service
The greater the years of life, the greater the importance of lighting.
Adequate light can help many to cope with the problems of age as vision becomes less accurate and dazzle more and more suffers.
The need for light also grows as a parent.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore advisable to invest in the effects and properties of light for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create Beauty Around You
Beautiful interiors can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
In popularity there is an unspoken japandi style, combining Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrostyle with its strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors has also become booms.
Trueness fascinates the same way as other home furnishings.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a custom-made, bold luminaire that has a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious," says Jokiniemi.
The home may not be equipped with the latest trend lighting, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewelryy and elegant classics hold their ground year after year," says Jokiniemi.
Thank you. Goodbye.
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are breaking down.
The Canadian attacker played three league matches without power points in orange black," KooKoo says in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no news of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
The special game movement Pelimies today recycles not only the games but also packaging materials.
The products of Kivifootkauppa's customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered online are packed, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us go for re-use.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," says Ville Puurula of the Oulu Game Man.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move on to recycled materials in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra burden.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is naturally suitable for Pelimies' operations, as in addition to new products, the core product range of the store includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in costumes.
They provide the basis for a good garderob with their versatileness, as it is easy to gather different outfits around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality sweaters.
This category also includes the black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with turtlenecks cannot be a mistake.
The clothes can be combined with straight trousers, tuxedo and jeans, and you can create both a quiet outfit and a snotty style around them.
Polopine is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from gold-brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, black turtleneck and grey ankles.
The classic turtleneck together with the other classics, the blue-green scone skirt and the wine-red Loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black turtleneck by combining it with casually trendy garments — jeans, high boots, and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialise in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service in the Western countries are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage sites," says the archive manager Vasili Mitroi (1922-2004) who defected to the West of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups a Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up inspection posts on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
Agents from the Cold War hid supplies of mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment for sabotage groups in the terrain.
Even in 1998, a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, with a trap mine explosion when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
The police reached four drunk drivers in the county last night.
The police caught four drunk drivers in various parts of North Karelia between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man in Kontiolahti blew 1,57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m., he drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanintie.
A 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil according to the police.
There were no serious injuries during the exit.
In the center of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old man from out of town who drove a passenger car blew 1.33 per mil into the alkometer.
The police suspect these male drivers of aggravated drunken driving and also the driver of Lake Polvi for endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllölättie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man with a local van blew 0.52 per mil.
He's a suspect in a DUI.

HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probation period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director at Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Philip Riska (central) has been important for the team in the start-ups, the under-power play and the defensive role of field 4.
Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the company management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underpower play and in the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still something to improve, it is good for the young team to hold onto such an experienced player, says Mika Toivola, sports director at HPK.
Hopefully, the value of Riska will rise while playing hockey league solutions.
Riska from Pietarsaari has played league hockey earlier in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Instead, Mr Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probationary period.
The true story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's film is made from them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard caught climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 guidance is about a survival battle that has been handled a lot.
They've made movies of tragedy and documents before.
True events are also being discussed in this case.
Twenty - two years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye operation prior to going to Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost sight, so the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But by some miracle, he got back on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers were thought to still be dying and once again left to his own devices.
The obvious thing is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even co - climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and the celebration of the centenary was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at the Eno church hill at 10 o'clock at the family fair, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at the Eno parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family Mass.
Uncle's vicar Armi Iravuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work," says Mount Iron (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Terrorism and were not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
The church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu following the destruction of the church in the fire.
The wooden church of the Excitementfell was completed in 1770.
In the morning there was a devotion in the fire, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was quieted down and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
On Saturday, a powerful hurricanelike autumn storm crashed from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attika, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclads and Crete.
The images from the area show a great deal of flooding around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows that between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region has suddenly appeared instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused intense seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even flood risks.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 shows that medicaments occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September and October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
In Greece, refugee camps in islands, such as Lesbos, have also been the cause of concern.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, too, areas destroyed by fires are hit by the storm around Athens.
In Greece, too, last November, a medic was raging.
We must not go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Traveling to the sea is cancelled and even when walking, be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by guides to a good 3,500 Finnish holidayers in Greece via Sun Trips during the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, because even storm Zorbas has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in gusts to as much as 50 feet [45 m] per second.
The harsh rains add to the bad weather.
According to tour operators, everyone who has travelled to Greece via Sun Trips and Tui, who has communicated their telephone number, has been warned by SMS about hard winds.
♪ But in the air ♪ ♪ Sun and heat ♪
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, by the beginning of Saturday evening the resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course we're watching the situation all the time.
Safety ahead.
Supported media caller Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our personnel on the target.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
There are currently more than 1 500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rodos and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had flashed in Rhodes and the temperature went to 27 degrees Celsius," says Ikonen.
Zorbas has been estimated to be the next nuisance of Turkey, albeit with a slight relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked the number of Finns who flew to Antalya Tui, for example," says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvinen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening costumes at the Missi Final - this is how they react to the situation.
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by the host Shirley Karvinen.
The two also noticed the same outfit and looked at the situation with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
The Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet driver at the Missifinal, and he's talking to the front-row stars coming in.
Huss has recently moved from Kamp to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office," Hussi wondered.
Before moving, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was just staying at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful," says Hussi.
Shirley Karvise's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention, gathering the curious looks of pensioners.
The host and Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen of 2016 told Miss Finland's final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Finland.
There has been so much haste that Garfield entered the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is glamour.
At home for a change of dress, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled his makeup out among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was funny, at least for the rest of us.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says that he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Garfield says he's been visiting the singles on Friday.
It's kind of brutal.
They're people's real feelings, Garfield describes the singles' feelings of the show.
How am I supposed to put on my upper knee boots?
Three Perfect Example Dresses
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that operates from season to season in a suit like a suit.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes there is room for more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overpile boots, which became hit shoes during the autumn and winter season, have not gone anywhere.
According to their name, the boots over the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
Showy boots share user opinions, but a bold model is worth a try, well - courageously.
After all, the boots on the upper knee fit in any outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, tully or tricoon, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good in the party log as well as in everyday clothes.
Black upper knee boots are good for delicate outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plier skirt and a delicate, bountiful sweater.
A fresh but autumnly stylish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from long copper-brown velvet, over-pile boots, spectacular earrings and a riveted bag.
Although there is a certain degree of subtlety in the over knee boots, they are also perfect for a relaxed everyday dress along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's wonderfully easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They travel for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic by robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot all year round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robot cars are coping with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, traffic manager.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully automatic in the rest of the traffic without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several sensors and assessing whether the driveway is open.
If it is not, they will interpret whether an obstacle is detected by a vehicle, a bicycle or snowflake, for example, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4 for robotic transport development.
Robotic cars travel all fall three days a week: Tuesdays between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., Wednesdays between 10 and 15 p.m. and Thursdays between 10 and 15 p.m.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
You can tell by the signs of the robot cars.
The bus is most secure at Otakaari stop number 1.
The bass player from that band fell off stage in the middle of a job and got hurt.
The band Mokoma announces an unexpected situation on its Facebook page at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The band's gig at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the night.
I broke a twilight's wrist.
The band will inform you on their Facebook pages.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped last night in the Packroom on stage in the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done with a backup, the pages will read.
The fans of Mokoma respond with concern to an image update where bassist Santtu lies with a cast in his hand on the bed.
This is the news we've been waiting for. It was a bit of a worry about how bad it got.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones heal over time.
Take it easy and get over it quickly to Santtu and have a good tour for the rest of the band plus the replacement!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great job, but you promise to leave out such a strong drama for the rest of the gigs?
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and license of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons and for the use of self-charged chicken fortification weapons were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily base payments for illegal fishing.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, the police once.
To sum up, hunters are very well aware of the validity of hunting.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen is going to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Kai Mykkänen, Minister of the Interior, will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year and include representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) will first select people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly in need in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people do not arrive for different reasons.
He will also meet with the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Mr Süleyman, and the NGOs on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
There was talk of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
During this reign, the silent visit will be the first one made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Co.) and Paula Risikko (Co.) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland will receive EUR 10 000 from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going off the rails. You don't know if you're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Karjalainen reported last Saturday on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals which have not been specifically authorised by ministerial decrees in respect of production animals, pets or other business activities.
In other words, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except the animals specifically mentioned in the Regulation.
If the draft law ends up as a law, I think it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law expressly prohibits activities that endanger the security or good practice of society.
In principle, a ban is now being imposed on any activity which is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
The government in general has been weak in its preparation of the law.
If we now take the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that animal welfare law will require an update.
But this kind of legal project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a procedure as 'Everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.

Baby Alexia, three months, sulking sweetly in Jere's arms
The Karalahti family photo focuses on the sweet, three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established for Kerava.
The sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and the former hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received family additions at the beginning of July.

Johanna Tervo was hired as head of the day care centre.
Turkey is urged to download mobile phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists particularly warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reportedly moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday evening, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the internet is working so that people can receive current updates," says Anadolu Timesi, a local news agency.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, the red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service gave a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, Ionian Islands, Kyclads and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
People were quite calm, Laura Aaltonen from Tui Travel Agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from the Finns in need either.
In Greece, many ports did not have ships on Saturday, according to Amna, a local news agency.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, telling STT about travel agencies.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected in air and shipping.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the cause of Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
The Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too tough in Russian gp time.
There is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, however, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-drived and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen clearly said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
The rapper was asked what caused the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the time-times, we saw a rare treat for Sauber in Räikkönen's future stable.
Next season on the Ferrari, Charles Leclerc was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson reached the final time session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place to leave is best in over three years.
And even though in the second session as many as five drivers did not drive altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the future of Räikkönen?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the early days, it's been a big step forward.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart evening was on a steady footing.
The German was a more protagonist in the ring, but he couldn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius, who is more far-reaching, controls the fight with his tough sets that found their way there.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left.
The hit was so hard that the old man who was in front of the home crowd did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderate.
At the ring interview, he began by praising the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We brought a belt today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get into the World Cup, Helenius commented on the evening paper before the game.
On the other hand, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is not getting any younger, Helenius, who was 34 years old, admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult circumstances
The rescuers sought the trapped and also the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port town of Palu and its neighboring town, Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Prausa, and the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Saviors report hearing screams from people trapped in ruins, but the lack of grubbing - up equipment has delayed the beginning of rescue work.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has ordered military rescue and grubbing-up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications in the disaster area are cut off in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Suomi finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laughback
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Ruukki, Billnäs.
In the interview round, every Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist number six, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, had a hesitant response in the audience present, producing sweet but benevolent laughs.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user of Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was read by a Miss Finalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before he began with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
A pause in reflection made the audience laugh, until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics," Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Previously on Miss Anttikoski's tour attracted attention because she did not want to pose in underwear because of her principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown.
Sike's apple pear cake takes his tongue away
This recipe is for you, who have good, acidic apples from your own back, because a domestic apple is shockingly expensive in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if the cake is also the pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed homes.
Slicing.
Melt the butter in the pot.
Wrestle the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour to the foam and melt the butter.
Combine corn starch with baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180°C for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then cancel the tray.
Just cut the cake when it's cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and is easily crushed because the dough contains almond and maize flour without gluten.
The International Criminal Literature Event will be held in Ruka in January
In January, Kuusamo Ruka will host for the first time an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related program numbers as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish fiction, and Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, the Swedish duo behind the author's name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also be attended by writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish authors at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" with slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and the disparate coolness.
Charmingly, the cool people, as scientists describe it, had many socially desirable features: outward - minded, friendly, harmonious, and qualified.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, insurgentity, and the edge.
They thirsted for experience and paid little attention to external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of tough isn't long-term cool: high status in teens doesn't necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what Child Development published in the United States in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, getting into good - looking groups, and trying to win favor with others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they did in the past with their more inconspicuous peers.
High status relays do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most people were more willing to make friends with people wearing a regular supermarket shirt than with a designer shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a sign shirt when getting to know each other.
If you're on the Greek resort islands, watch out!
There's a cyclone about to strike. The weather warning is screaming red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, as much water can be rained as in Finland over the average of six months.
The Zorbas horrid storm will strike Greece during the weekend.
Prepare yourself if you are living in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclaads or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on their Facebook pages.
According to the broadcast, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The upcoming storm is also reported on the weather service foreca's blog.
It says that the storm's hardest bursts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, Finland was beaten by the Kuisma storm at its height by over 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
On the weekend in southern Greece over 300 mm of water can be delivered.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the man-slobbered Love Island Finland Anku?
Performs in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, Anku, a beauty drooled by several men, also performs as a craft aunt with strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to make an squid from an old roll of paper.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how tights can be spent on a hedgehog with real spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a slightly surprising way, Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, pantyhose and grass seeds from which he makes the hedgehog.
You can watch videos below or on Ankun Youtube here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi, is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook for a little more than dozens of minutes after his Russian gp pole drive while he was in front of the media.
The great tour left behind Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important psychological criticism of the Finnish driver this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
Feels good, still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on the stake once this year in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good to me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
It's not easy to get past Sochi's track, so it's a particularly big part.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer his questions about whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's going to win the World Cup in front of the coming Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the stake, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me and me is very big, so I'll have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after the race, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff had a taste too.
Lewis had a plan to beat Valtteri, but he couldn't beat the seven.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged up, the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
The question was whether the stable would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive uprightly, Wolff answered with evasiveness.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen, who is a guitarist, won the Finnish Rally Championship.
The SM series of rally cars came to an unusual end.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finland's champions at the same time.
It was now done by Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen, the Kiteian, secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the finals sealed him with a Finnish championship of two-wheeled cars from the SM4 class.
Honda Civic's rival Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku competition with restraint because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give evening when some of the extra lights failed with another special test.
That's a pretty blind spot for a third piece.
You know, in a situation like that, you don't have to be in the wrong place.
On Saturday, only the speed of Jussi Tepo, who was the second in the series, was followed," Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Secretary of State Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Mr Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and he said that the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday, in Germany, that a meeting on Syria is planned for October, with the participation of the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judge drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, got an exceptionally large number of people in front of the screens.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were exposed to the full - power appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge on Thursday.
At that time, Donald Trump's appointed Kavanaugh and his California professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate judicial committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary findings, the hearings were followed by a total of 20,4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed live streaming and CNN reported a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts of the year.
CNN will increase by more than 10 million, including those who followed the shipment via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million start-ups.
Digital start-ups are the channels' own, TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but in any case they will be skyrocketing.
There's not a lot of people out there who can reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually only allowed to play sports games and the great Oscar and Grammy gala of the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, it's a long way to go to the American football league's final game at the Super Bowl.
This year the Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Mr Trump's first speech to Congress was attended by almost 48 million people and more than 30 million inaugural people, according to Mr Nielsen.
It's a top priority.
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on many issues he was a so - called scales language whose voice could determine the position of a court of nine.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided by his vote that same-sex people were entitled to marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his heels.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock down the court for decades of conservative superiority.
Children have the right to be informed by parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was made in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing time to correct.
Now we're going to have a repair in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a call-through.
Then, with the layman's understanding, it's about the push of the button: now that the wire is held, it's opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has a bank account or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
I.D. is for a fee, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a grade 4 primary school student except by asking for it printed out.
It is not so much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is of the utmost importance that parents be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations in which not all things can be talked about freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the U.S.A., the FBI started to clean up the harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations from at least two women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Committee on Justice.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it does not necessarily become public.
He threatened to kill cops at the police station in Kajaani.
The caught brawler continued to pullicate at the station.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "soot off."
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night against Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities are reporting an incident that began when a man of 30 and over filed a violent dispute at a downtown restaurant.
First, he assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to get in the way, he hit her, too.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
A patrol picked up a man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police say.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "soot off."
He's a suspect in three assaults and violent assaults against an officer.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Sulawes in Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia," says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information for the Finnish Unicef.
The local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness," says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue operations are underway in the city of Palu in Sulawesi, but in the Dongala region, the situation is a little more unclear in the north.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off," says Haru.
The buildings are often light - constructioned on Sulawes, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter... first, for example, tents... and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing most people can do is offer water cleaning tablets, which UNICEF also has in storage.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is being transported first by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification is one part of Unicef's mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP) which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started a fundraising campaign to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, Chairman of the Tesla Board, will end the $20 million fine for tweets.
The founder of space rockets and electric cars, Elon Musk, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his role as chairman of the Tesla Electric Car Company and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of the contract he entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisor.
By making arrangements, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The SEC threatened Muski for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla from the stock market, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to preside over the Tesla Board for three years.
In addition, Teslan will have to appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communications.
Musk still gets to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski's personal $20 million fines, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding $20 million fines to the financial supervisor.
Tweets Misdirected Investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla's shareholders astray.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billionaire's tweets say the company would have been bought off the stock market for $420 a share.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent in 24 hours, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Muski's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the overseer, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
In addition, he had not discussed withdrawals with any other management group or company board.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell by 14 per cent when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
It is expected that the company's course will be renewed in order to agree on the news.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point to 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt heard an exorcism and the organ was playing by itself.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected," says Suntio Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account states that the last sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of the malfunction.
