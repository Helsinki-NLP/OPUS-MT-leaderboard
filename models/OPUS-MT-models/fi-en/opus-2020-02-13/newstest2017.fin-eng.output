28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the steps of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother, however, says that he knows no one who wanted to hurt him and says: "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner's office was called.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined to be a homicide and that an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had had his dream job as the manager of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters representative said they were "horrible and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close family and is going to be sorely missed," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels at the beginning, but that recently "his business was finally going well".
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling united with the family was to make us food, to make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother, drifting with the stream.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco police hotline 415-575-44444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new industrial combat measures
The representatives of doctors' trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial battle measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the Council as a whole to support new industrial battle measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors' trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
On Thursday evening, in a letter published via Twitter to members, Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the JDC, said that the government had remained "constantly silent" on the issues which, he said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject completely the proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the progressive and expanding industrial battle programme, which is beginning early in September.
The dispute has resulted in the participation of doctors in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA's medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawia, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement recommended by BMA.
He had told members of the BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors interns and students that the agreement was a good one and that it should be approved.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
An organ that ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter's palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, there was a shakedown.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he did not much heat, even according to his own self - controlled standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels but even better.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the allegations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a cease-fire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed in last month's failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by the continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists off the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables, once agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Vedemost newspaper said.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Hardy is angry with the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge at the progress of the snail's accession negotiations, Putin, who is eager to exploit coolness and break Turkey's ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got points from Ankara, where he called after a revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is clear to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the Praesidium Sea Palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to introduce an 'outside association', as one analyst described it to me: two countries which feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, to join forces.
However, these two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be telling that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster as NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
The Bank's strategists have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands during this period.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But it has now been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the headquarters and stock exchange listings will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and employees, because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is now time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we have asked questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win with a total of 3,000 wins
Racer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone in his second victory of the evening on his home course in his race for John Goden's coached Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who used to win at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot. It's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks cheers when he brings Predilection out after victory.
Two riders have achieved this milestone in the obstacle contests - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical intellect separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big games!
Speaking seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a vibrant person who's a good thing for a British race, but he's an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a booty landing from a saddle formed into a trademark.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A great deal of profits in the big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned after six months of non-competition, he had a difficult time at first, but he showed considerable strength of character in challenging the skeptics and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin dismissed by Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to move away from the leadership of the Russian presidential regime" but that he had no reason to do so.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia's capital in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the president's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your action as Head of State as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Persecution be replaced.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet Security Service at the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complicated, even laborious, task for four years.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Puti after the second period, as Puti's third period would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close associate of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to office only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at a series set in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, acting as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios' statement, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the series of FBI agents will be expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in Dharma & Greg's sitcom has been in the series since its first period in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series has been planned for 28 September.
Mysterious fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a cyclone.
Bain, 500 meters [500 m] from the sea, released film material from revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two - inch - long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry's crossing point and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four brackets between the "folders" which are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 harus ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the finance minister, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the bridge between the country bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme measurements must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be put on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shutdown represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern pillar road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, or inland.
This was done by pulling the road bridge to the north 700 mm south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Required because the tolerances that the team worked with were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
But I'm glad everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alarm at 1.20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by themselves.
"We saw the boat coming closer to the men and imagining the worst," said Vince Jones, the pilot of the Moelfre lifeboat.
" Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, and the third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had a kill switch on it, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and take part in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now, recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they produced a cartoon series, cards and other sequels).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was released in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the game release in other countries was delayed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Gola had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
When explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which can then be "photographed" (with the help of a phone screen) or "caught".
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which monitors 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
The calls from many public health campaigns to "find 30", "nouse on the couch" and "be active every day" have produced no results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too many to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends in hunting.
As usual, disgruntled jokers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk to the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there used to be applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new attraction disappears and the use subsides in due course.
However, because of Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity snorting.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
It's energetic in jumps.
It's smooth on the boom.
I can't believe it on the floor.
Great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
At the balance bar of the US Simone Biles, women's gymnasium in the multi-match finals of individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman who has successively won the multi-match championship and, overall, the fifth American champion. At the same time, she strengthened her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
She burst into tears when her final score was announced, and her long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement raises him to the same level as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated his sport, winning 15 World Cup medals, including 10 gold, with programmes whose mix of ambition and precision has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was waiting in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors as between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the multimatch of women's stand gymnastics in the finals of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Billes won the first medal on Tuesday when he culminated in the departure of Martha Karolyi, the coordinator of the retiring national team.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his trademark Volt-Ohitus - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on her way to school at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powermaker.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak should last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small position after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He took the lead at boom points 15.433 and crossed them with 15.933 permanto.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final score -- mere formality -- and tears rose to the glister, white and blue eyes of Balaam when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in divided third place, but lost the bronze to the Mustafina during the renewal.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the audience after his perm performance, in an emotional state of return, which at times seemed questionable.
As far as Balaam is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting from this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot while they were listening to music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack of the first serial killer case in Phoenix last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police bulletin published on Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The bulletin reports that the shooter standing on the passenger's side fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped by another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple homicide did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, since the attacker did not take purses or $2,900 from another adult victim.
Detective Jonathan Howard, a representative of the Phoenix Police Department, said that the shooting caused the investigators to examine whether it was related to four previous attacks.
Seven people have died and two have been wounded during the nine attacks of four months in two main Latin - American districts.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release on the shooting that took place only half an hour before the triple homicide, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, bullet in the seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6 years of age with microcephaly: "It's going to get easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small - headed, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
This is not what I signed up for.
Which is not at all true - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to sign "sing to me" with the signs Edmund invented.
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language. He tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods resulted in rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
The heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their banks and posed a large flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the needy counties.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Department for Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they're getting requests from high tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipaho County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
In a statement, the Weather Service said that another three to five cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat was the flooding of Ascension County lower down the river as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
To the south of the state border of Mississippi, the river Tickfaw in Liverpool in Louisiana was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Saviors are still picking people out of floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were near Gloloir on Friday among the rescued.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally more than 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way around my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the brook water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have injuries and that he is the only one capable of swimming.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued the three in a large military-style truck and took them to Glolomir Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday night.
Krautmann says that floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain from Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
CBS's subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipaho said 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tides.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipaho County, some 20 streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last great flood here was in March," said the city's administrative authority Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no cases of flooding have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain continues."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, full of bullets, survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez to the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The types of shell casings that came from various types of weapons of attack filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here and that they were in active combat," said Anthony Ginaldi, Philadelphia police chief.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin - American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Party, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won individual gold in a women's multimatch.
And a teammate named Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually practice in private gymnasium clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnasium clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
In these clubs gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Party coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15 000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning Olympic team gold, and for motivate so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young femaleness.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that the NHS was on "unknown soil" and that even minor further delays harm the staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new agreement, which will include changes in nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Doctors' Trainees, said in a statement: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially as it accelerates the existing labour crisis and does not treat all doctors equally."
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new treaty, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been faced by the government's unwillingness to participate and at times with deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion and take into account the concerns of doctors' trainees.
If he does not do so, the doctors are prepared to continue their work in combat.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend wage for those under contract with 54 000 doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation and cause concern, anxiety and disturbance to patients, carers and their families."
During the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, costs of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - will mark the seriousness of the employers, the Health Education England education organisation and the Ministry of Health's compliance with the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine that pays £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients benefit from a two - pound - a - day drug after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The medicine used to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NICE, an NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, an NHS overseer, has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances in the wall of the artery that form stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If a clot is released, it can pass through the blood and break the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, an iso-Britan company, sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft guidance for NICE recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Without regard to the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, as many as a quarter of those who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we first recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for several thousand people who may benefit from them.
As ticagrelor's efficacy and safety data - especially regarding the risk of bleeding - are limited over periods of more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, being exposed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles chisels the police, electoral officers and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of 'racial and religious hypersensitivity'.
The former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set guard chains outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present identity documents when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter's finger should be filled with incorruptible ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected," says Sir Eric.
He calls on the press to have greater access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report as a result of the vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the President-in-Office, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 'enoughly distorted' the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of the faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person's voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the vote on election fraud by post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for the clearance of the voting system, including the proof of identity with an identity card.
He says: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... the institutions of the state had ignored such behaviour because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to race and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with the ballots received in the mail in order to put an end to the 'voice collection'.
The report that Theresa May is examining also calls for more stringent amendments to registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use incorruptible ink on the finger of a voter so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic voting by post.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made sounds and envelopes sent through the mail.
Let the police set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at the polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adheres to the rule that voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is going to take down the Grand London police force saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The electoral court stayed as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his officers," he said.
On the basis of a number of grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized inefficient "tick-to-box" checks in the voting offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy of parliamentary birth, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bicyclist twin and other famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Besides Kate's doppelganger on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures rose to the surface, where he looks frighteningly like The Wolf of Wall Street's star.
And in fact, as he became aware of the social media passion, the archer admitted that he has heard that since childhood he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London from 2012 will certainly also come up this year: the startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aly Mustafina and her big, expressive eyes have been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russia's silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than tan skin and blond hair than Annalynne McCord, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between two similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet also think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical with the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as Gabby Douglas, the gold medal winning gymnast, whose own, beautiful, wide smile matches the smile of the Star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying that a Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message from the women's 4x200-metre freestyle was infuriated on Wednesday by CBC's direct Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "disappeared like a bad smell" and "dead as a pig".
The commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter free-diving finale.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team with "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
The viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'dead like a pig'??
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as "The little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was fast and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running CBC broadcast, apologized on live television for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on the swim performance was on air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words; we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
The commentator, Scott Russel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published the statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized to our viewers and our followers on the social media live.
For the sake of clarity, Mr Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectfully, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client is dismayed by a woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the store.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's store to try on panties.
It didn't make things any better when, after assessing what he looked like in his pants, she took them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally made arrangements for four pairs of underpants at a shop in Folkestone, a shopping mall at Bouverie Place.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underpants and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "redressed and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of exposed panties, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on a fitting leg.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to make amends, he just stood there shameless."
"Everybody stared when he took off his underpants again and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, a 33-year-old living in Kent City, said: "I hate to think that someone is taking home underwear someone else has tried, but they haven't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is all right."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's store on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products concerned have been removed from the sale.'
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation's Grand Master, Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York City, to find out how to deal with gun - waving robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from front or back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker in the same way.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first step is to turn around so you can see your attacker and "remove the line of fire".
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting the groin with your knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face, and stand back with the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing this, to be exact.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The host from Suffolk and traveler Ian Wright, 51, licked euro banknotes, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a train bathroom flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called The Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the washing button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in his mouth of bad taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of the endurance of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This mission, extending from the railings of public railway stations to the toilet seat flush button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "From childhood I've been rather carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from dirt, worms and muddy water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, internal power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in here.
On the trail of internal power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as C and D vitamins to help enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and came up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Document director Tom Hakala added: "Let's just say it like this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things licked were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we could save some of those dirty licks."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The bully family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall, Saltash, before the eviction.
The bully family caused £50,000 damage to their rental house after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of Cornwall's Saltash property after numerous complaints have been made about them.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, upset housing workers found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls were filled with gaping holes, floorboards were torn down, garbage was spread on the floor, and the walls were smudged with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot to consider because this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their names are infamous."
The couple had three sons who lived in the property at times, and according to the police, the family terror contained street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, was decided on anti-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of demolition found old waste.
The property from which drugs were previously transmitted was pulled up on the floorboards.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down the crazed wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's conduct, as eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous members of the community who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived on property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
After the eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
The employees of the housing company must now clean up the waste surfaces around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis plus scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug as an intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her associates live homeless now that they're in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls in the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say they're trying to evict the residents who make fun of the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said that the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a military jet flew low on the shores
Sun - worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, suffered the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion took a really low pass
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, terrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military plane came close to contact with sun worshipers on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, although they did not at first see what was coming from behind the clouds toward them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro last afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of a dramatic pass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It went by twice really low, and in one place it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured that no one was in danger.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to adverse conditions, smoke caused by fires and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Exiting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
In January-June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) produced EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
Exit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was granted in all operations.
Exote will try to reduce the number of queues this year.
Exit covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The excess is perhaps used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Exote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers took a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Border and Coast Guard Training Corps was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Ranger Course whale event was held in the military sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special frontier medicine.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated a RTA unit, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible outwards.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a Sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different types of investigations for the rest of the police.
In Häme it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
the most recent reform of working methods;
The creation of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would not leave the scene until they were alerted.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police work is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Crime Police is the national leader.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department's territory.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of your own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the primary police.
By means of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, prolific crimes or similar crimes.
This is called a series and is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the pattern of the act, the unsub forms a certain image.
Complicating can be done either on the basis of the way you do it or on the basis of the person you do it, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of personal and criminal methods, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will state these methods publicly if they anticipate a threat.
For example, this case was reported in early summer, a method of marking vacant dwellings used in home burglaries.
It was the people who put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment that they tried to see if the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the minutes of the District Court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen of the Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuumela of the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical action.
This is due to a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National co-operation collects information from outside the boundaries of Finland and Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined the fathers from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, said that the girl's family heard that she died in Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike against the Taliban, a military base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, after her family, she died just as she was planning an escape from a war-torn country and her return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others, that there are real risks of going into the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton's gonna hold Garland as Supreme Court candidate if he's elected.
Senator Harry Reid says that he is convinced that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have been blocking Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Head of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will replace Anton Scalia, the late Supreme Court member.
Reid said on Thursday at the teleconference that he predicted "some degree of certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "swirl the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "handlers" and "possibilitys".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemer to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of the treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with lots of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We have to start showing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release in which the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or at personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love quills.
Before you rush into filling the commentary section with irritated insults written by the nickname NotAll LonelyMen of Middle Ages, you will notice that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken new coming of the discs is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased vinyl discs are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, it is unlikely that those of the 18-24-year-old age group who buy records will be able to do so.
It is also not just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but also of emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in their hearts (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through the busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be signaling a lot before I stopped, making a cup out of my hands and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's take a closer look at it."
Let's take a closer look.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed, hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office supplies are now filling up buildings with previously independent stores - a handful of great specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to evaluate their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in 20), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums.
These plates, which appear above the picture (he sent a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for such an enormous amount of disk and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and who have come to need to buy their old albums back.
As a result of my discussions, people have been getting rid of their collection generally in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their CDs," he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl wake-ups of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the discs?
In a shop like Phonica it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disk decks; objects that trigger the memories of teenage days of happiness.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said from the record stack.
A April opinion poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought vinyl records in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy quills do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I browsed through a stack of bona nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at the Sounds of the Universe (the three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a great deal, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fop, where today almost a whole layer is reserved for vinyl, has a much more versatile audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the movements mentioned earlier, the speakers are the latest pop of Wild Beast's synth and sex-filled pop, and the improvisation jazz is not great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so record-gathering isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain... "it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to make it look like I'm looking at jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter are thinking about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
However, given that even a little attention to these objects can mean more money for industry and send a few customers to Soho's for more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that youGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings prowling around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing records and avoiding the eyes of a creepy 30-year-old artificial TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that Holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is for a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and which is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to terminate the sale of the Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to dismantle 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's office argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent the non-taxable co-economics and because they are a fire and clean-up risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by a state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who needed them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people who run a temporary trade, but said that Calais's prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who were 'extremely insecure'.
He said that the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates without profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's cafés.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - top reading - since the arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices are falling clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food prices in Finland fall sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food has fallen in Finland by nearly 5% in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland among the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices reached a level close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn of events, after which food has become cheaper each year.
The price is now weighed by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT should be reduced to half the EU average and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at VAT rates are indicative.
School's not quite what it used to be.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of illustrious is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education begins on four.
However, the main change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known as ice sharks, but does not reach maturity until 150 years of age.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting on a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, according to follow - ups, only about one centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen examined.
He defined the age - old 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetres, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 salesmen are not deducted.
Almost 300 employees are made redundant from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his release.
According to this, the number of sellers in the department stores will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations involved approximately 3 000 employees.
By the time they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to save EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the grocery trade still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", Veijalainen says in the release.
The second quarter result improvement was especially due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain reached its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating profit for the whole Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday," says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but southward it will be pouty.
The temperature is not very summery any more, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was an athlete on the national team in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officers came to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," said Kip Vähte, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, who thundered at Reuters news agency.
The Olympic athletics start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich was ranked fourth on his way to the World Cup last year and has a number of Rio winners in advance.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source explained.
Where is everybody?
Rio Sports Stadium rubbers out of nowhere
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was started over the medals of athletics, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
The Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day's morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was another one in London, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of audience at the Rio Olympic Games has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hope, Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000 people were in the audience.
The bad deal is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian tourist race, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the campaign organiser's spokesman, said this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," Andrada said according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympic Games, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private, business and entities may use money to redeem holders' rights in the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of residence against payment.
In practice, the holder will be entitled to veto a block of 187 squares, which means that not every holder will be required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
The holder's rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect the environment," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The holder of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The website of the Foundation shows the names of the holders of the rights in the map where the parcels of the land can be found.
Leviathan sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is founded as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The foundation of the Helsinki Foundation's Elvest project is the protection of nature areas so that they can remain intact and undisturbed.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans land acquisition in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey the biggest cities in Finland.
This year more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained on the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts occurred per 1,000 inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were only reported about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"There are double thefts in other cities relative to the population," says police inspector Tommi Reen.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Ikäs.
Tommi Reen of the police department is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to which cities are studying and cycling.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In the January to August period, slightly fewer bike thefts have come to the attention of the police in all of Finland than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and approximately 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're huge amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report the theft of a bike, even if fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"You can also find cases in other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, inner yards, warehouses and wheel cellars, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not known that stolen bikes are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if the good-quality bike is sold at a price that is clearly below the price," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says the Moose. "No one has ever been taken, a good monk has done so."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, this doesn't necessarily have hipster value," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike pecked the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, which alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Most of all, bad spins, such snoty Jokos."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valvee himself from the courtyard of the housing company.
Although the bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
You're under 15 years old and you're responsible for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of conciliation that are used side by side.
"Every young person's actions are directed in a more responsible direction, so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflects what happened with people about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path you have chosen," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported in the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetentness and record displeasure threaten to bring a landslide to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only direct targeting of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-corsed anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States.
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy can do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a hand-to-hand hand for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We're a builder's people, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that rich people should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax refugee, it will have to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I, as President, am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the financial programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "prefering only to millionaires of this kind".
The reduction proposed by Trump in corporate taxes has previously been called "Trump's loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the ratings of Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually sports competitions are shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached a great number of spectators.
At one point the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: at the same time 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 followed the swimming on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago received almost 800 000 admissions to TV2, and the European Football Championships received well over a million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports have so far been the Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, which both reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, the chief sportsman, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
Even on television, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers throughout that period, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's competition broadcasts come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store as the freeest download application in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the ratings for the network until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena hasn't worked as well as we'd hoped.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
We have updated versions of the apps that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympic Games are more visible on Yle's channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can track some of the sports on Yle Fem, and on radio Yle Speech transmits the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the Rispinsel.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found about 20 square meters of pressure on the Risselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters," says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are over 80 metres long.
They haven't been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There might well be some unknown deeps," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of a central depth, it is Great Lake Yuka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne is unable to reach the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
A fan of the tax discount: Pensioners are still more heavily taxed
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the irregularity was raised under parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises given should be followed after the elections," he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in Parliament by opposition representatives who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is protected, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Mr Petteri Orpo, on tax reductions is mainly about safeguarding and not increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the reign.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be destroyed by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in a row
He calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop it from growing.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will disappear.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no reports of Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings of Finnish time.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but you should follow the embassy's instructions on caution," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel period to Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says we haven't heard from whoever did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that these events may be linked to the political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is smoldering, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok," Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to have an impact on the day's course, with the authorities being extremely careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, which are popular among tourists.
In a tourist destination favored by Finns, there were four bombs in Phuket Island last night, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death.
Two bombs blew up in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
We don't know who did the attacks.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more, he said to the journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks took place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Great Envoy about caution," Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and about the victims.
There's been a little bit more information about the attack last night at Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A local employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half hour or so.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four-game.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second score of 60.098, and Alija Mustafina of Russia was the third score of 58.665.
Partyes, 18, is still in the Rio World Championships for stand championships with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has had a lot of control over women's gymnastics in recent years.
He had eight personal world championships from the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permano championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, Party has achieved two championships in the team race.
You know, the party's got a lot of jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huevila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, says Huuvila, who has worked for some 20 years as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the avian flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
The office of the Huvila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The guard heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around nine o'clock at the local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The Huvila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday," Huvila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the day, traffic at Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huevila who visited the site.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the use of a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, the highest-ranking leadership change was made in Russia in years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He's a former diplomat. He's the number two in Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason why Ivanov was fired could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from building up too much power.
He adds that recycling management functions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from collecting power independent of the President for themselves.
According to the fabric stream, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Dropping station in Ivanovi
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin called the transformation into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer and proposed that Persecution replace him," Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era at the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönniemi of the Finnish Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syria Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected at 7:30: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the Minister of the Interior's events.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounting file.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified a need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
In the early days, he insulted his back thighs and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic exams.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the fact that a Jamaican star has risen in an era where athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest is underlined.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres period 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, with which he crushed the world record and the self - confidence of his competitors despite the final celebrations of 9,69 C.E.
This is gonna be harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
The world record of 9.58 100 metres and 19.19 200 metres in Berlin still stands.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a world record of 200 metres and a low 19 seconds, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt himself.
With 100 Bolt's greatest challenge is the Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prestigious championships if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011 the $100 World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in more than a week.
He's an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of drug abuse.
In addition, a Kenian athletic coach was sent to his home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of ep-hormone.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his case of doping to the CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sport.
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other suspicions of doping in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female estranger Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of ep hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a drug abuse.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that a Kenian coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to the media records, this is John Anzrah, a Kenyan speed coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 - meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping Phelps. Historic gold came in the show style.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-metre mixture in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an evening magazine quick interview.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or in the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels shoes and a short dress with at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to startle you and perhaps even startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio Police made two arrests on suspicion of terror.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons prior to their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The arrests are believed to have ties to the Isis organization.
The arresters had reportedly fuelled violence in social media.
Among other things, the popular WhatsApp service had been used to disseminate messages that called for violence.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their pre-group fight at the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the beginning of the fight because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the crowd into the hangar after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had entered the race in a sleepy state.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria by 96-87.
In the last two games Spain reached silver.
This is the third time the police have carried out a controlled blasting mission during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time I saw the police, they had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road biking goal last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-string Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pummeled Petaja-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a rough time on Thursday.
Argentinian dame beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because under the Olympic rules it would have been pointless.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn was left in 27th place.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The car accident didn't have much effect.
Friday is a big day when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are customs that directly or indirectly affect a person's health in such a way that his or her life is prolonged.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include the tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don't even have to spend all the time getting a can of milk.
Many studies have been carried out to find out the secret of a long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Harvard University's study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, studies in favour of alcohol suggest that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
In contrast, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway examined how laughing affected a person's life span.
Over 54,000 people were monitored by a seven-year project.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
According to many studies, sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for your health.
In addition, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
The exercise will, of course, bring additional years. There will be no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute levity.
In fact, an Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got into medals at the Olympics, he's more likely to live longer than a regular pigeon.
A lot of research has been trying to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that the person who shopped daily was likely to be older than the person who shopped less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may result in early death.
So put down your credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver in a drunk-in-the-hours accident went off into a truck.
On Friday night a serious accident involving a lorry and a passenger car took place in Koskö, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskella, Koskuntien and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right angle of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it was set on fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and then passed over the ditch onto its roof.
The woman who drove the passenger car in 1972 was squeezed in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a serious DUI.
The mail sent some loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's selection of loose candy was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy at Salo K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So if there's no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is on the Post's menu until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the upgrade struck me.
Representatives of the media have been calling all along, and the attention that this issue gives is incredible, Eltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elves got their own favorites to grab in a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who was responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti's Companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets wandered off to the wrong place yesterday (Sinajoki) and no longer left for part delivery (Saloon) by three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was the Evening Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Loss of weight! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost ten kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos due to a change in life.
Lotta shared a pair of pictures on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work as early as 2009.
He has made a comprehensive lifestyle change and has gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday Backlund released a pair of pictures of his incredible performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The backlund image pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from co-suppliers.
You're amazing.
You're on your way, motivation's hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
Your pictures give me a lot of strength and enthusiasm when you're on the same journey, the other tells.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Let's Do It Now" project.
At that time he told the Evening magazine that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos.
During a three - month exercise, five kilos were finally dropped.
The family wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not by flowers and petitions, but by a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication shows that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor, and not afraid of work.
My dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have said that the victim was very animal lover to the Evening Magazine.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post to violation of the Equality Act
The Post had no right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, assessing the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post could have withheld only a part of the trainee's salary that corresponded to the part of the full day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's Association Decision on the prohibition of introduction.
During last November's postal strike, the PAU decided not to familiarise Post employees with temporary workers who break the strike.

Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its letter earlier, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concerns in favour of freedom of expression and of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration... and replaced by a man of Estonian origin, Persecution.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergey Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
It will be the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Mr. Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin's press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer and proposed that Persecution replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
The BBC: ManU's giant buy-in to a no-playing game is not seen at the opening of the Champion League.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen on the field when the British Champion League kicks off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed us to England.
The huge purchase of Manchester United, Paul Pogba, is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, told the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened with a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round of August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred in the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's a little out of the ordinary for us to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to last year's 70 000 by 5,000.
The festival will also have a series of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance it.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being controlled on huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grass-dressed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The biggest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creative things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled to be particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a job in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday night, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wildlife living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it right here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bars, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favored by the Finns.
No one's known to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new alert forces goes into battle first in a war situation
It is not until several months after the military oath is taken that military troops are ordered to fight in an acute war situation, reports the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, interviewed by the magazine, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight for example for 5.5 months of military service.
According to the Head of Training, the first priority is to appoint reserve members of the emergency teams.
None of the military or reserve personnel are ordered to perform a mission that has not received the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training the armed forces in the immediate capability units starting next year.
Units can be used for military operations when necessary, even during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was harmful to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in the condition of demolition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple's legal proceedings and settlements.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, as the purchasers had already known some need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good health.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a fit home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
In terms of risks and non-compliance, the fitness report mentioned ventilation and the lack of adequate management of the rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwater from the cliffs might have to be controlled a little over the course of a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were far more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which according to the Witnesses were due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillaryly raised ground humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior via the porch.
Healthy risk, mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the housekeeping room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window isolation and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make non-authorised changes to the dwelling before the sale.
The terraces, for example, were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
Home problems, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, the purchasers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
The purchasers have not failed to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and licenses come from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were conducted in women to investigate the matter.
The race agency investigated women's backgrounds by, among other things, studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency handwritten biographys and good recommendations from close friends.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "savers", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, states the museum's website.
On the sixth floor of the traitor Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko ranked third in the first race of Finnjollie's day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was left at the top of the tail of the whole group at the second race of the day.
In the overall situation he rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren took 23th place at the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork and is currently in a frenzy lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Kopinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The bridgehead's career rose to total praise when he won the crown of the tango king in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned some different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know it was sung with a hangover from recording a song that got a huge hit.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up with "You Earn Gold" in texts published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmäs were not as the Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined himself making a record that told a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the news in the 7-day newspaper.
In the news of the newspaper, Jari and his ex-lover were told the reason for the divorce was Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign by former US president Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, the stupid" flew into a junkyard in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics will provide professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status among economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it promotes the export industry.
The Economists felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, they were struck by the fairness of the BBC, which gave only a couple of percent of the economists in favour of the difference between the EU and the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hate press was not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other powerful economic combinations on the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
The academics of big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit from the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for the real British children to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and particularly EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish company Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result were to be left, the plan B, that is to say, the victory of the camp that supported the EU difference, began to be prepared more closely.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but could now be necessary.
We went out to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of news.
Old man says the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds," Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down.
When the European camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one trust after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cost you.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen Continental European Funds.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
He felt that the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures dominate about 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the end of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not look more "funky" to Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the period preceding the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's activities in the real estate market in London
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, in charge of property investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, came back to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive in spite of this morning's night.
At the office, the television screens that were normally set to be silent were squealing the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive," says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a correction.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The weight collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic falls in the property market in Britain and London in particular.
The London office premises were expected to have losses of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the weed has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear to have been the last summer vacations this week in the face of Vanhanen who spent in Helsinki.
He felt it was far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will be made and how Scotland will react, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already received first-hand information.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent was accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man does not think that the parable is quite right, because this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that one, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's also a financial guarantee that's normally available.
The repair shop could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he didn't think it was a miracle that the price adjustment was going to happen without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a very high altitude.
London's prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalised," says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led, for example, pension companies to seek returns on new destinations.
On this basis, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
♪ Decentralize, decentralize ♪
In London, the rise in prices evened out last summer," says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten his holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops," Vanhanen says.
He's too afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly a shot in the ascent.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can work through the pits.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised," says Vanhanen.
The S Group will start to register shop information more closely than before
Soon the S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it is starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, once data has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to hold it on products purchased in early May.
The S Group will follow Kesko here, as information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and are used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information," says Riitala.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer programme and there is no such programme planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own One-Bonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with Valtatalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will report on this later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
At first, an experiment.
So far, SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data include occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method have been recorded from the S-Etour card purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, for S-markets, Prismos, Home Terras and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
The S-Group says they're going to inform their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data will be stored in cages anyway, whether they want it or not.
The willing person can check their stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
Black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five identical boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings for the powder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tull's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main place of work because the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs tasks is mail delivery via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails per year pass through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 findings related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into all the checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research," says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about this idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides which smells Heila is taught to detect.
Heila is always further trained as needed," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs as well as the cash and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from ten puppy litters.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as tranquillity because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The cameraman of the evening Sanomat loses the microphone cover of the camera to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy cover immediately from the "move" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, recalls Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70,000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was over.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in Suva, the capital city, where the stadium had a screen set up.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging," said a journalist from the Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish lifter fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter, Milko Tokola, was successful with his last attempt at 175 kilos after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined score was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weight rose with the ferocious roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - League of Bets - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player on our team who has power and has a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than 10 players from around the world.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, as Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS explained in the release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinna Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemiers meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Brave Modern Family Star again: Teenager Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again flaunting by showing off her pompous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in social media pictures with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, suspected that Winter is experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost his whole life, growing up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look exposed, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the decline is already so tough," says a woman at Winter Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start northern lights in early autumn," Visit Finland says in the release.
The main destinations of the Japanese Northern Light tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the assets of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
Winter northern lights in Lapland are very much in demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision double-folded, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's main target group for the Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would long for clearer unique sights in Finland, and according to Lind, the Northern Lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland," says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver while Fid's master class leads to gold
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed at the final challenge presented by Fiji at the final on Thursday night when the team suffered 43-7 crushing losses at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji set up a master course in handling, bitings, evasiveness, support, running lines and sheer strength as they won their first Olympic medal of gold.
The loss came with a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy 7-5 victory over South Africa by the semifinals played earlier that day may have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 in this condition.
Great Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Britishman has a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, they were trained by Ryan to lose every game in Adelaide's tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but it's a startling development.
Fidi started out excellently, rejecting British tackles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running into a moving bus, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish line at an angle.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right-hand side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the male-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just a drag on Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, and Great Britain was at 17-0.
Nakarawa scored another new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock... from the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through Britain's loose tackles and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation at break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
Great Britain made a lot of changes during the break that blocked Fid's dam... for a whole four minutes, which was good compared to the first half time until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute goal was frosting on Fid's cake, which needed no frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged and the Great Britain fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
Earlier that same day Fidi had struck Japan in semifinals 20-5, and Great Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish zone with stunning footwork and scored under the goal poles at the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the England 15-aside rugby team, secured the victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 hard strokes toward history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three votes on the boat, and the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time, as the two of them engaged their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairing contest, the first women in the history books of British sports, which achieved such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance as undefeated, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface with swan grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as relevant as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't operate, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate to have been able to start his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside the period when they caused as little interference as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations such as this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking around in section 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment of Afghanistan, said: "I have been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It only emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I, and Robin, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's got a lot to thank, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the race in five years.
The couple set a heavy rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen screamed "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to get good rowing and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of people wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when he marries a TV adventurer named Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland's changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protestors who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks are calling for already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians used tax havens to circumvent taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised at that time to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn elections.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear sense of criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tumults.
He said that he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down that low as commander in the army, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini bathing suits on bathing areas, which are popular with Muslims, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are large-scale religious affiliations, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Lake Pyykkösjärvi blue seaweed
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Blueweed precipitation has been observed at the shore of Lake Toykös.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the shores of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci in the marine pool were confirmed on Wednesday when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limit.
The sea of Toykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a seaweed flower, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water in the form of rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through more frequent inspections.
In the event of a blue seaweed bloom becoming a blue seaweed flower, the bathing area's information board will also be a separate information sheet.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational conversion of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one," says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticisms in the tax change proposal.
Forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income less all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal starts with a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry, which prevents it from leading to a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it," Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said that the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The threshold for tax deduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000.
It's too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been taking after Hakkarainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailer surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and ran into each other.
A special chase took place on Friday morning at the Kalajoki Himanga.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars in a row derailed into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the driver's tail.
According to Harri Pyhtä, the on-call firefighter, the ditching is suspected of being caused by intense hailing.
In the car behind, there were two persons who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the vehicle that was driving ahead was not injured.
The accident took place on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments that are more effective than before.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's study team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer treatment may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the research were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos's family home killing continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another person.
Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both convicted.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
One received eight years for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of one of them is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without entitlement as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a lesser sentence for a young person's murder to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit in the schoolhouse in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go and led the youngster to his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled with a lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from the family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, only growing at 156 years of age
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
To add to the life span of the ice shark, it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Investigators found out how old they were by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
They allowed scientists to estimate the age of sharks.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of the total tax revenue of the state would not be received if the change in corporate tax that Donald Trump was promoting was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, particularly as a result of tax incentives that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6%, after a discount from Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the economy and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste need to be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector needs to be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint 'experts instead of bureaucrats' in the administration.
According to Trump, 'suffering' trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 - percent penalty tax and from Mexico 35 - percent penalty tax.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme take the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is frantic, but the real tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street chatter - accounting with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun and fun satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of my Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It's a conventional serene love, relationship and family drama centered on a mother-daughter relationship.
It's a simple story and we'll see a lot of it as a long flashback.
Life seems to be good for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV acquaintance from the series Time between stitchings (2013-2014), comes to the second leading woman.
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be viewed as a slob, but I would say that time is time-swipe.
The Almodóvar films often have a fair distance from such a characteristic flashyness to the humor of Julieta.
It is a flatly played, subdued, place with good music in some places and a rather sad film that has the ingredients for elephantism.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is still in place and so that it gradually begins to stick its eye in a pure form rather than as a working dramatic power.
People in the film are affected by illness, death or otherwise by sudden loss, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is particularly true of dress: in the case of a name person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the tunes of the respective scene, is not getting any better.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has produced the manuscript on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro of Canada, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novellit has been published in Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat evenly written literary filming.
Emotionally, the ingredients would have been infinitely more dramatic drama, so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the film's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
lead: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are going to be done a lot.
There won't be any new surgery.
The four billion that have already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the SM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework group.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
♪ Municipal elections haunt you ♪
Why are ministers so emphatic about the fact that no new cuts are made on these?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallup reports, however, that the government party is waiting for the Finns to lose their snorts, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
The base Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, of which the price of influence in the right-wing government will be realised for a large part next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the ability of the Finns to stand up.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government politics in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also come to the surface.
First of all, the new cuts are not going to happen. First of all, the fact that next year they are going to be done violently and the second is going to try to soften the waiting attack on the Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take €5.9 billion in debt next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hand in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring Parliamentary elections will accept what comes next.
These measures do not allow indebtedness to be reduced
It is quite clear that the current measures do not break down debt, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäe at the press conference prove this irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse of 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will reach 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost about EUR 6 billion to maintain unemployment, which will be virtually fully covered by new debt.
This is the understanding of the city centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of Finland of what is responsible.
Survey: Many tasks are left to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation's research.
A clear majority of the population also takes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building control, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled are most clearly the responsibility of the region.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be delegated to the State.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantstie on Friday night at half past six.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorbike without lights, but a young man went to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonakajanranta road, from which the road continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
Nor did he have a driving licence that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch in Lake Polvi on the Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The emergency services lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the personnel and paramedics of the rescue helicopter.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil poured into the road from the crashed truck that was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the river Ilma
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahtinkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a tall, thin, well - rounded woman with white hair under her jaw.
Observations and tips on lost movements are asked to call the hotline 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The fall current that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Society of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed in the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow rate is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling airflow.
Changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools down and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the slipstreams.
The crash flow hit Parafest in the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 persons in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries to further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed the most toxic particles in London and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
Cutaneous particulates are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which almost 9 500 Londoners die of according to Evening Standard each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their business trips near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by means of various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed, pushing the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor did have enough time to push the man to the central hospital with serious injury to the further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further because it hit the rocks in the front.
Resurrection to the coming season
The League-Riento, a member of the League of Rivers playing in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from a better starting point than from memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common note can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Rienno, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
In the foreign trio, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, 23 years old, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwandan national team, is a five-inch chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a length of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all the world championships in the gym band since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at the North American tryouts.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a national team for the gym band.
I got interested, and here we are, Kempänen, 48, says.
Gympanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Kempänen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, no such sport was played at the SM level as the gym bandy.
They played the ball at the university.
I played basketball at Kataja and later at the River Boys in the SM series, Kempänen remembers.
Gympanen played the gym band SM series for the 1991-92 season with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club to the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, the balance in 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoinen-based Tatu Väänänen, a Joensuu-based gym bandy club, was elected to the Finnish national team that will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh problem and is a member of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
The national team also named Mika Kohonen, a former player of the brothers in Seinäjoki, who was last seen in Finland's shirt at last December's World Cup.
Petri Kettunen, from Kontiolahti, is the head coach of the Salibandy National Team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach Volley will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in a series of adults and young people alike.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of the rankings of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been at the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can make it to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in the neighborhood," Hasu feels.
Kouvola's neighborhood lit Hasu's spark in sports and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
You know, there's a lot of memories of being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old at Elimäki's YMCA E-girls.
The top part is the oversized jersey, the knee pads on the ankles and the amazing aces and choreographies after the point," says Hasu.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the Society's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of species during junior years to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
The beach of Kärälammi has been playing songs since the 1990s.
The activities of visitors have always been active.
I also went on my own to watch the junior SM tour sectionals, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Annina Parkkinen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still don't have the SM gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toe slippers are on the nail, Hasu is planning.

Solomon's Koli courageously set out as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon's Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas too.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his little brother Valtteri Koli, began acting as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking out debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on the farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was very brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Solomon's Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has produced results, as Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) inflation rate has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, face - twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticised for promoting a blackface mask or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat this week advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow face" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for those who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others fiercely denied the comparison of anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photographs was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison of the grossest Asian caricature and the effects of the filter" side by side.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip lines.
American culture seems to be tied up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be discreet."
On Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his essay to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly white male management and ended his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#Remove Snapchat)
" Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but according to the representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and take forward internal integration efforts.
For their part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence.
In a Thursday's report, the Congressional Panel said that the authorities from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces Military Region were editing intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than was justified by events on the ground.
In the interim report of the working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Appropriations Sub-Committee, there was a "wide spread of discontent" among the intelligence analysts at the headquarters who said that the superiors tampered with their estimates of the American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Military Region in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of intelligence approved by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than justified by the facts on the ground. They were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community authors," stated the press release in the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said representative Ken Calvert, California's Republican.
Centcom's management's failures reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the descriptions and analyses of headquarters in the United States of America's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the senior administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as having felt as if Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe in a more positive light the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from headquarters to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, in the statement.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the highest intelligence directors of the U.S. Armed Forces Military Region headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is under way.
The Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense has started an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House's intelligence committee published their own findings which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican working party.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly isolated process of intelligence assessment between ISIS and Iraq's security forces," said representative Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs", made the mood worse among analysts and "did not give enough room for different perspectives".
Mr Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to their 'preset or political narrative'.
The Daily Beast will report on the preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Chief Inspector-General has begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom's analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the increasing number of defence authorities are now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on headquarters to deliver honest assessments of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic state reflects the dispute over a decade ago when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the mutiny concerning the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes against the Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The Centcom commander at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organising a showdown with Britain
The day after having scored three goals while the team won Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the American women's field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: Americans are in the 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan's 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who's first and who's second in their six team.
First ranked to avoid strong Holland, the leader of the second group, a little longer when the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have been upsetting with their surprising success here, four years after they left the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of three (his older twin sisters played a sport in Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16 when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympic Games because he could not be included in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've turned around.
Thursday night, Bam started his first half-time goal with a knuckle close to the goal.
India had come to the game with one victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then he rolled into the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender in the tournament to Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation," said Parnham, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the trampoline in the middle of the olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
As if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with his smile pits, could well be one of the names everyone knows that are presented to their best time and supported by sponsorship agreements and TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley of Lake Forest, California, 28, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the center, partly in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by all: aerial gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast swim. Long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000 when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, its presence during the past 16 years is so limited that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not make it to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian medals are usually awarded by men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoline, however, has a certain underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suited to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an incapacitated fan.
The sport has opportunities for amusement, as you can see from the vibrations of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumps, the two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jump up to 30 feet high with a giant trampoline and have to perform rolling motion sets (turns, folds, and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those hoping for medals must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are hunting not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news, another blasphemous line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer cry.
But that is also the reason why watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline will give you a moment of rest from this.
Trampolin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new climb, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no frantic rush to the end, no leaps to the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will be held Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 1 p.m. (ET), men's competitions will also be held on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will send finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 2:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, attractive moment that is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as recently suggested by American male gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
In Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States, the "Growl Shows His Mind"
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot to death in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, the strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets, demanding radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spreading videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and the West appreciates its stability.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives that much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new train for commuters.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have always spoken of government oppression, the opposition in that country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is protesting.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition that dominates land use in the grip of stranglehold.
After the much criticised elections of last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat held by the opposition and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle over this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first one seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Ormos and the Amhars, are getting along better together.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in Amhara and Oromaa.
Many amharas and Oromat believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre people, which account for about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret disease in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say that he was especially qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Today's administration has no such basic instinct," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the Tigre don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005, when thousands of protested about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been taken by the government first and then robbed by them.
Many protesters died, albeit less than in the last few months, in the ensuing attack, and that period of anxiety passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Amhara city Gondari attacked companies owned by Tigres, and anti-Tigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations place the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently said it closed this base.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based Father's claim to "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly argued this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain the remarks he does not necessarily mean.
After the insinuation made at the campaign meeting on Wednesday evening, Trump argued the same with increasing enthusiasm in his interviews on Thursday, where he insisted that he really intended to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early Friday morning Twitter release, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The most recent review storm comes in a situation where Trump has re-focused his campaign in the midst of the results of the economic polls.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
Running back to Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, when he faced widespread criticism, apparently proposing that the Russians hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic."
This approach will allow Trump to go to the borders of the political speech and then to come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of relaxing his speeches for a large voter, Trump has been even more brisk in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump is following Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid apologies for provocative things he has said, he often accuses critics of misunderstanding his words or of misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
'I believe there are real political comments in his words', Mr Giuliani said when he was asked about the truthfulness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organisation he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to find out about him, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he was unfit to be president.
Previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals felt sorry for it as the latest loss in a middle - class city that was being renovated.
On Twitter, artist Molly Crabapple wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinventing.
Last November, the revived Verb opened up to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unambitious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought me some new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and egg cheese sandwiches, and the coatings include capers and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like this.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into a coffee shop.
He says that when Verb closed down, he gave up his coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly as the clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagels with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient in the cold coffee from the coffee shop.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up in a spot soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the next building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depressing food from the Depression
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
The delicious mouth of President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue food, such as foie liver paste, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told of life from a Lower East Side apartment house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some sort of culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the Depression.
"Musemies were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, beansloaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe made a fuss.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
Over the years before the recession, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like eating-so-a-a-a-many-like-a-many tables.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served with breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as meatloafs and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a wonderful way to use leftovers", said Ziegelman, because chefs could hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparing luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman prepared an ancient dish where fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter when he was doing research on a book containing recipes.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman stated: "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits into fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetors" and to meet the challenge of turning lumps such as mashed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Hoover's let me eat your cake attitude.
At a time when he publicly praised his childhood's simple, Iowan country food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gold-plated dining room.
He was amazingly out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "did not only offer one of Washington's worst, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the depressive eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: "He even made people sick."
There was an incident with a wind hat.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe took out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman added, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to sink their spoons into a sticky brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once and a half.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck in the hepatitis C patent.
The U.S. escrow judge has decreed that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the legal expenses incurred in the case of the hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from payments of $200 million after breaking two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvon, following the discovery of Merck's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, U.S. betrothal judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to exemption from the compensations it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead's drugs.
United States-supported troops say they've taken over entirely the Manbij controlled by ISIS.
After the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday, the entire city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, has been taken over by US-supported forces.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the last group of fighters who hid in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were held captive by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, cost 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income for that year was $10.75 million and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speaking allowances, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career in the Foreign Office.
Clinton's Vice President candidate, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set the standard for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in the statement.
In stark contrast with this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and many other ties with Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem by publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those making over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he also had an audit of the IRS, and that Trump was not "fearing" the tax office, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the Clintons in Chappaqua in New York had a real federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an affordable index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $ 109 000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the elephant protection in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements -- throwing animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation several years ago, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a four-step non-violent way of protecting homes and crops without hurting animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools...we have seen a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguid said in the statement.
The first two steps include pointing a flashlight at an intrusive elephant and playing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chilli powder and soil and a firecracker, followed by a condom so that only the fuse remains visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts the chili powder dust into the air.
One stroke is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is the trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's area code at the request of the Arabs
A French filmmaker with Jewish background let loose the media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area number. According to the employee, this is due to the "asks" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, unsettled his frustration at the Berlin hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ release.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find an Israeli hotel on the list of country codes.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received "stranged him."
The hotel's recipeist said it was a deliberate decision by the hotel management at the Kempinsky Hotel.
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code," says the employee, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "a great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinsky Hotel simply "condemned" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Desperate," said another publication, pointing out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "unprecise" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the list of quick-choices was never made," says the representative of Kempinski, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds.
On Thursday the students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when the students met to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to break up the student group, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended a demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals made by Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paolo, under 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing a graffiti against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters started as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended from office while the Senate voted on his charges.
RTbusiness: trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"One of the most important objectives of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 % compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of USD 856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran, in particular, increased by 91.5 % to a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $ 158 million.
"The growth was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year the Russian Foreign Representation in Iran issued around 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will break," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scot Callum Skinner jumped to the finish line while the British were picking up bike gold.
The Scottish Callum Skinner in the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the British team's trio defended his championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, who was a distinguished man, and the legend was proud of the young man when he scored the goal, taking the victory to the fore from the New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing themselves in the sixth March race at the World Championship in London, although Hoy has since finished his career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of the special broadcaster Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held on to in view of the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own tour, Hindes was close behind, but Kenny pushed the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Twenty-three-year-old Glasgown Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We made an Olympic record at the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain's competitors have not complained.
This time there was no similar problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like it was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven out of ten bikes in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold at one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that seems to be the holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would have a total of six gold and one silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny's next race is for the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed this one.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the knight's dignity."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were among the fastest in four-person, four-kilometre team racing.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the appointments when the officers invited him for a long-term survey.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great bike team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach a whole series of medals.
Having presented itself in Beijing and London with truly exceptional and complete control, expectations have been minimized before the Rio Games.
There has been drama, the least of which has not been the separation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the career of great people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's legendary reputation of peaking at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The smooth future of Portland, questionable because of cutting the electricity contract
The future of Victoria's aluminium meltdown in Portland, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory's owners is closing the distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian administration not to extend the aid required to maintain the plant.
The aid for a period of 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of plant closure.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelting uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting furnace, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melt is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The operation is now following a series of years of speculation about the factory's future, which started with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the other three owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL awaits the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the unfrozen physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements', which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months and are therefore effectively terminated in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to be profitable for the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong prospects in the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already 'preceding termination' reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Mr Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the melting process or to safeguard the unfrozen supply of electricity".
The US company said that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been on guard not only because Portland, Victoria, but also because of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
‘If both plants leave the market, this represents a significant reduction in demand for [electricity] markets.
As a power producer, this would not be a good thing for us," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality show star, is on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and modeled at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or perhaps just suitable for Kardashians style?), a handwritten reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Ryan Seacrest, producer of Keeping Up) forgot his sister's cover, but ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliché of almost every "day-of-the-day" series of children's television series (Seacrest utters the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny jerk), but Krisi had to make her other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved on to a new era of the Kardashians with the seat of the September Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
The September issue of Vogue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like coffee minutes than fashion magazines, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832 page opus were advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is so awaited that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics who serve as models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities".
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as "the success model" of his generation, would hit the first category, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career since Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of the moment".
This feeling came up again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But running around in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications behind the pay-per-view wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took for the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a reality TV star.
Every year, 160 000 people are turned away by Community legal centres
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned out of the Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centres of the Queensland Community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on both the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to increase the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was accused of having a gun pointed at him.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the North Carolina head of the campaign had gunned down an employee in February while driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought on Wednesday by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin in Charlotte, State Court.
Bordini said that he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and shoved a pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said on the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had similar experiences with Phillip, said the application.
"You don't have to fire guns to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "second-up people" - usually understood by gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his word out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
In Bordin's challenge, the campaign will seek compensation for careless supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Mr Hope Hicks, representative of Trump, did not reply to the request for a comment immediately.
The attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call for his consultancy company Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just in local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we worked so hard to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of ourselves in front of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and an economic growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has completed the 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment program in time and budget: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse games about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising programs are "cat and mouse games", said one of the companies manufacturing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising inhibitors on its computer site, Adblock Plus published a blog entry that said users could update the program filters to re-block ads on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code on its website will be exchanged around ads to make it more difficult for advertising inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's circled a new code.
In the blog article Adbuck's representative, Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of round-the-clock battle between the community that inhibits open source advertising and its orbiters has been going on ever since advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief the ad-blockers have become to industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reports last year's Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is looking for advertising inhibitors on computer pages, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram," the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think that this type of activity is worth investing.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it dailyed its "ads preferences" tool to give people more power about how ads are directed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the website's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook's representative said in an e-mail statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman got hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently due to suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morges in Vaud Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman did a "desperational act" and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles," Vaud's police said in a statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, told by the police, who are appealing to them and all witnesses who have witnessed the incident to report themselves.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logical" step in a situation such as this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year, the police were released from the charges of involuntary manslaughter after he hit and killed a man lying on A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The Court found that a police officer who was reacting to an emergency call drove in a justified way and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has information about a Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was likely to be habitable once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus had ever had a hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rate of rotation is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still could have been spinning slowly.
The model also examined the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect itself from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explains Anthony Del Genio, researcher at GISS.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story of Venus' evolution, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up the job of Avalanche's coach.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the activities of Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president - general of hockey affairs, saying that it was the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Deputy CEO/Director General of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 years old.
During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach's and the vice-president's views must be fully in line with those of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first season in Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado's playoffs in the first round, and the team hasn't been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the season 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draw, and the team lost five points to Wilde, losing the West Conference's wild card playoff spot.
Hall of Fame selected goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
The labour battles of North Sea oil workers for wages are postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, said the leading negotiators.
Strikes against Wood Group, an oilfield service company, have been arranged occasionally on North Sea drilling platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, Unite and RMTs can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", the joint opinion said.
Over the next few weeks, we will have several meetings all day early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction will result in a 10 % reduction in 2014 for contractors in its countries.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in the Plejad star group
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the Pleiades star cluster's rotation speeds.
New information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the star group rotate at varying speeds, and how orbiting times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for infrared processing and analysis in the press release.
The Plejades star group is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the crowd have been born some 125 million years ago, and are about to reach adulthood right now.
They're spinning at their top level now.
At their peak rotation speed, these growing stars cast large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of identifiable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones making devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the plejades, we see that slow bikers are usually more massive, while the fastest bikers are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejad constellation is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at rotational speeds.
"The pleihad star group provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models, which include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, hang their 'dancing shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plejades in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
