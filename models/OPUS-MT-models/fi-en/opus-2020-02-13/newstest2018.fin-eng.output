Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "People should have a right to their own bodies"
There are dozens of patient stories hanging from the ceiling of the project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he was.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to diagnostic studies of "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, she had used the estrogen she had ordered over the Internet and was already very advanced in her own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law a person must undergo a correction process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translakis, i.e. the law establishing the sex of the transsexual (563/2002) obliges transgenders to force sterilisation in order to get the right sex into the population register centre and passport, for example.
At present, every sex repairer is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive disability.
A person has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and the European Court of Justice has a precedent which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change of law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections came and the True Finns came to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
It is a question of domestic political disputes which do not even have anything to do with this law.
"The board does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the board about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland's Department.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient history installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these he wrote a report that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of the reality to be studied appears to be prone to wavering.
The study subject's perception of himself appears fragmentedly at the border level and the unstable personality traits are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting lobby of the transpol into the ground.
Later, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove their breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than the number of genders defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
For many, the sex repair process is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many who seek the process have psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
With these in mind, medical personnel may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"To prevent treatment and help can put a person in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, it got easier.
He had finally been able to lyric the feelings that had existed since childhood and teenagers.
Why the wide jaw didn't seem to fit into its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
What's important to Auer is that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing yourself, using your voice and moving," he says.
Now Auer feels he's already been seen. He exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you get wrong.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
But not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, there can be no formal confirmation of their own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the opposite sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and the Auer exhibition crystallizes this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art is still important and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP for African-American civil rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
"The travel notice for the NAACP Missouri enters into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been numerous questionable racial events", states the Association's press release.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult for cases of discrimination to be brought to justice, and the implementation of state law is disproportionate to minorities, which, according to NACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped by color and beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The Missouri travel announcement is the first warning of the United States State.
The organisation mentioned racist comments against African-American students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and the Missouri police arrested him for not being charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Justice Minister's report that 75 percent of the black driver is more likely to be stopped by the police than by the white.
"The purpose of the travel information report is to advise people to be on guard and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare themselves, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU organisation, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following their adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for illegal immigration offences.
In general, travel warnings are published by the State Department and concern other countries, but have recently been published by non-governmental organisations in response to specific laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for state-owned management, has asked Finnair for a report on the contribution of the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo," Yle says.
According to the Minister, this is contrary to the state's wishes.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by the wealth company came out this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Varaamo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has indicated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The government owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's corporate governance decision.
The sanctions immediately made the speeches tougher.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be on their way from the cold to the warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted in Russia.
The most striking response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were to be offset only as political rhetorical exacerbations and excesses, it is a fact that the relationship between the United States and Russia was strained after a short honeymoon after Trump's choice.
In the United States, it was not simple to pass the sanctions law against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress did, however, approve the law with considerable unanimity, but the President felt that the adoption of the law was considerably more difficult than it was said.
Trump recently criticized the law he signed as "significantly incomplete".
President Trump's exasperation must have been due in particular to Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting his own prerogatives must have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States on the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential elections as well as on the Russian connections of the Trump campaign.
The tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandals have been revealed almost up to date, it seems more and more obvious that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a chimur in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US Sanctions Act are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project may be affected.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid gas in the US economy, for example, from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most secure sign of change of power is the intervention of statues.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, took down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief thinkers of Trump's regime, well knew what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus' poem – 17 years after the statue was completed – was added to its pedestal.
Thus Miller shone at Acosta: "I don't want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty... is a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The most important are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only the immigrants but the "poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your Poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to break the free, / The written relief of your theme store."
The poem is now more timely than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, and he made it clear that the 'poorest' are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After Lazarus ' death, his friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to his statue's pedestal, knowing well that the act was a powerful political one.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicanism by the classical symbol, the feminine incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh, who can now be regarded as some kind of omen of Trump, claimed in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of neo-conservatives, leading the United States torch into a world of darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants on the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts us by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's definitely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not lead the way but stirs up the flames of hate, their only source of power.
World Championship in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made the British national team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the UK Sports Federation, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Sports Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is "something special going on" in Scotland, from which British athletics must learn.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I discussed it with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Sports Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is linked to the activities of the Union,
and the British Sports Federation believes that it is based on their actions.
And the average guy on the street thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely wonderful, which is why."
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His Captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happened to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400-metre fence race of the Commonwealth Championships, and these are his fifth world championships.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Midway runner Laura Muir has been running five British and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: a man has an excellent season with winnings at the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scottish on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's "greatly proud" of having so many scots involved, some of whom are really competing for finals and medals.
"To become a captain is a great honour, but it is even more special because the captain was voted by the national team members," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They're part of a team of distinguished athletes who compete for awards.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but soon the newspapers began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, always on his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was very annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as stupid and silent as sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and has blocked their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unjustified, and the attitude was also trivial on the web.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many commentators.
But it matters.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic state.
He has received the second-best estimates of his operations among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to hotheads.
He has led the state firmly and held firmly to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users entering the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's publicist, Amelia Chase, defended the governor's actions in an interview with Washington Post, who said that it was only a question of moderating comments.
However, branding commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed people who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and proper.
In his comment the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked about hate crimes.
"I politely expressed my disappointment at Hogan's failure to comment on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments on the Washington Post report.
Nor can I accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignored as a large group of citizens concerned.
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack."
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrested and silenced protestors.
In reality, however, it is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
He's been sued by Twitter users blocked by President Trump.
The first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria District Court, the Loudou County government violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation went to talk to the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's day, cheap postage had a similar effect to that of the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they barked at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising Jay's agreement, the United States-British Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as shown in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington Network Project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
There's been samples coming from about a dozen places, and there's also online ads about a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also from individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki," says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green peppers have died of a tricomosis parasite.
It is caused by a scientific protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to hit pigeons in the past, especially the pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in wild birds.
In 2009, it really hit the fan.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green finnish population, after which the species' populations have been on the way to recovery.
There have been sick green finches now, but not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki's Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
The fear is that the last epidemic of green finches will come back again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home court advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led a tournament on the Archerfield Links field next door last year before the last round, but finally lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and is an ambassador to the tournament on behalf of the founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's been doing a great job with this place.
He's a keen ambassador to the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field."
For the first time, Eales, an English champion, has won both the European tour and the European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a very special opportunity," says a player living in Southport.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is going back to the real world on his own soil, and he went on tour with me after his 50th birthday earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the home area is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated
In Säkylä, at least so far, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's Communications Company, as the Brigade was reported on Thursday.
Further indoor studies will be carried out.
The reports began when the man who interrupted his military service for health reasons suspected that his health had been weakened by bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of the other armed forces.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that no other person who served in that unit had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The Brigade's bulletin says that due to the July arrival, goods had to be moved into the barracks, which may have caused the dust to increase temporarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy as a result," Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove for cooking.
Even the boiler is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato – locally "not" – directly into the fireplace.
Half an hour later, the sweet potato burned to the ground will be devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing in murky water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is provided by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to be cared for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares walk through the village after five at night," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in Papuan highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villages were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which is holding the region under strict control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and crass. The trip starts with an hour and a half flight from the province capital, Jayapura, to Nabire, and continues on a five-hour driving trip with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The town of about 19 000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboos, whose corrugated roofs have been dyed into yellow browns by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries came to Papua, the Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-woven tapering cap, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"In the past, all we had were leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is a high-rise area about the size of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants, just 100 kilometres from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, for they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid almost $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers being paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 beanmen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s took on the scale of genocide.
Last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful demonstrations.
The report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of 2016 contains stories of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods – and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move into the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javawarung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market place at lower prices than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who comes from Pania and moved to the province's capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised to tackle the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
The Panic experienced some kind of wavebed just two months after Jokow's inaugural ceremony in October.
Eleven children were singing carols by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
Scared kids told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, and according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, the children were captured and beaten with rifles by drunken soldiers.
That's how one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand beanmen — young men and women and children — met in front of a local police station and an army command center in the football field to demand justice.
They were carrying hunting springs for the ceremony and began performing the traditional Waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where we dance in a ring and imitate the bird song.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that has not been made available to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, sensed that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine his brightly colored wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from soldiers' ranks.
"There were multiple shots fired in the mob."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," he told Yohanes TIME, sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua told the reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, publicist of the Papuan police in 2015.
"Then it's life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The next day, the news of the killing came to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want this case investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his words.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but certain processes are needed," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity", which involve the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999.
The families of Paniai's victims view claims with gloomy disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He tells us that he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He reports that he had been abused by soldiers when he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will hunt me down after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighborhood of Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital care was the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been on the water while fishing on a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a moving police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, resulting in the death of one villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw wounded people being brought into treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the arrest of police officers who have fired shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live in the verdant central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the Spaniards through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and arresting thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'the safeguarding of national sovereignty'.
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that's too expensive for the locals.
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food — mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihood of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go to better educated and more wealthy migrants at local level.
Only a few beaners have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Outlying Papua is being overlooked in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been granted a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting on Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces in Papua and West Papua have new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting", Kine stated in her opinion.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from the nearby neighbourhoods of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "multiple and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman at the Indonesian State Department, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with press freedom, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
On 4 May 2017, when the official delegation of the Dutch delegation led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but the Beans report that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi any longer.
"Jokow means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the rest of the Beans, regard the voices they give to Jokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once more showed resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks at Robert Helenius for canceling the rematch: "Even your fans don't want to see"
The heavyweight fighters Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 in Hartwall.
The fight, however, was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, is putting the blame for completely flopping the rematch on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's rude.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales for the rematch were slow, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been postponed to autumn.
Since then, there has been no news of the fight.
However, Chisora is no longer saddened by the cancellation.
After all, the fight would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My tyr was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on," Chisora says.
The British say they're in about 45% at the moment.
From the looks of it, he's not interested in rematching with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat of Whyte in December.
Fire once again took over a Torch skyscraper in Dubai
The flames took over the highest residential building in the world in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to flee from a 79-storey building 337 metres high.
This was the second fire within two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai's rescue services, the fire forces were able to shut down the fire at four o'clock in the morning and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building commissioned a study to find that the boards used to cloak and isolate the facade were the most affected.
In Great Britain the police believe that the insulation and cloaking plates of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night.
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9:00 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police are requesting observations from the moped or its theft by e-mail to this email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveal survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items to planes past the TSA checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other sharp objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1 percent said they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the questionnaire and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7% of passengers who knowingly violated the TSA rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15% were members of the X generation.
The rule was most often broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking sharp objects to the aircraft, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said that they deliberately took banned drugs to the aircraft.
The survey was conducted by passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken the smuggling goods past the security check and how many had done so deliberately.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also most likely to pass a security check — knowingly or unknowingly.
However, as the company that made the survey states, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken into the aircraft and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while there was also a belief that books were not allowed on board.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, twisted his decision to delay decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, director of the EPA, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under Obama's regime to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency that he is head of takes better account of the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
Pruitt did not say a word about the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
As of 1 October 2015, the Länder should start to comply with the ground ozone requirement.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year, so that his office would have more time to study the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington issued a decision that the EPA Director exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama ruling on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In its opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his reversal of the ozone rules would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then waited for activists and others to sue it to reach an agreement on the timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action he sued the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise its powers "to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the public prosecutor of the State of New York, who has sued the EPA this week, said that the group is going to continue to exert pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed in their communities to the direct effects of the smog," Schneider said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This smog can cause serious breathing problems for vulnerable groups of people, which is also part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight against Trump's regime, whose ideological aim is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups."
The supercar manufacturer's on his way to the SUV. It's a Ferrari-style thing.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about plans at a press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All East Savo measles cases of the same virus type
Beach-salmi measles infection is the same type of virus as East Savo's previous cases, reported by the THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed by a beach salmiian person on Friday 28 July is of the same type as the previous East Savo cases.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other measles virus types.
It is possible, however, that new infections may still occur between mid-August after the fifth one, and the epidemic is therefore not over," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, Soster's doctor responsible for infectious diseases in primary health care.
New measles infections or suspicions have not been detected since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection," Erkkilä points out.
More on the subject: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a legitimate scream
The Pontica soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
In the background, the argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Making a scream at home will be legal next year, but legalizing a moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, and the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
There has been no political will to make the moonshine soup a right to every man, commented Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the moonshine was not considered to be legalized.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation," says Outi Mäkelä, Member of Parliament.
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Even on application, you cannot continue to grant permission to distill the moonshine at home.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importation tells us that the home making of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make screams at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows the production of a scream," Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavouring and flavouring materials resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many beverages as you want, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
You're still not allowed to put it on sale.
An act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much greater change took place in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital with armed guards escorted.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital because of suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British journal Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning with armed guards escorted.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for medical examinations.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family, on the other hand, said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a sixfold Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated phone conversations reveal Trump had put pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
The lines between the telephone conversations between President Donald Trump and the Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump asked the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speech about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a literate of Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on the way to Australia would be a 'delicious', 'stupid' and 'stupid', and that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an 'ideo', because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call I've had all day."
Georgia's Massacre: Activists reshape racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in the country of Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man is squirming.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-conception that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is placed around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-shape the events of 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the restructuring.
"It's a disgrace of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former congressman in Georgia.
To him, re-selection is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe's people that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want things to finally be concluded, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents from NBC News, over 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have always been known by the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, by a decision of the Supreme Court, the blacks of the state of Georgia were able to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, and the Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, there was an incident in which a black tenant named Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said there was a rumor in town that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI records, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison made bail on $600 by Malcom on July 25, 1946, against whom he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and organized the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks will put it more succinctly.
"It was a right-of-vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating: it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we would have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't hear me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal for this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — some ten blacks and 20 whites — gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the head of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always so difficult and repulsive.
"I'm gonna feel dirty because I'm not myself," says Marbaugh.
"It is important, however, that this side of history should also be brought forward so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester's been having an affair with Dorothy.
I told you to get off my property, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the punch.
And then everything (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally find too fast?" he asks.
"No," Greene's squirming.
"I just don't think white people used the word n---u at the time."
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, but to honor the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are breaking.
No one's laughing.
The redeployment ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice is broken at every other word.
A few hundred feet away, about fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half the audience is black and half is white.
There is a couple who have come to see a performance in Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited the victims' graves under Brooks' guidance in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have turned from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene calls a crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy whispers like he's reminding himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who perform lynchings take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the performance comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for dinner together.
A white couple from Alta will discuss the performance with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings she has caused her performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible acts that people say and do that look like you – just because they look like you," he says.
"I was shown that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Mr Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Recasting is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Harassing vegetables in shops makes me nervous: This much money is actually saved by removing "extra parts"
Is it permitted to remove the cauliflower leaves in the store before weighing?
What about taking off a big piece of pineapple? It weighs a lot.
The answers strongly share opinions: for one it is an expression of extreme nudity, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that they do not use and which, however, go home into the garbage.
They'll recognize the phenomenon in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear out the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the store's biowaste.
According to the news published by the financial reports, the merchants are surprised by the nagging at the vegetable counter.
But how much does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is the nudge method really involved?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take off leaves or strains from pineapple, top artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: the price of cauliflower paying EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 when peeled off all the leaves.
Ananas: the price of an entire pineapple costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Latva artichoke: the price of EUR 2,60 was EUR 2,40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Sweet mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: The average broccoli cost EUR 1 and without carrying 80 cents.
End result: If leaves and strains begin to pluck off, at best a few tens of centimetres are saved for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona. The Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with the PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league, EUR 222 million to buy out the football.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, costing EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
According to the League's rules, the purchasing club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract, which is done by recycling the money through the League.
In practice, the PSG has paid Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will examine the details
Barcelona also announced in its communication that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association, Uefa, in order to enable it to determine any disciplinary measures that might result from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that the PSG, through its use of money, violates Uefa's rules of financial fair play.
Uefa can punish a company that will lose more than EUR 30 million over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic policy.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an impact on the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for considerable amounts of money, Uefa was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company in Qatar.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Ten-thirty for Neymar.
Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from the lightning strike. The flash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on a plane at the Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane to the ground of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said he got electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I'm just asking if he's alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone," says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
The British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by £300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme aimed at reviving the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his stake in Penguin Random House publishing company to Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. In the first half of the year, its turnover increased by one per cent and amounted to GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city, where the authorities reported that the attack resulted in the death of a NATO soldier and several others wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured during the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed during the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh area.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was the target of an attack on an "self-propelled explosive device" carried by a person.
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20 per cent were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, in an area where Shia Muslims live mainly.
The Taliban reported that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the country's most devastating attack on the militia after the US-led forces overthrowing the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPA will reverse its decision to postpone the implementation of the smog regulations.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under Obama's regime to reduce smog emissions one day after 15 states had sued the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "otson definitions" in 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Scott Pruitt, director of the Agency's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018. According to these definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Office was sued by 15 states, mainly democratic, including the District of Columbia, according to which the suspension of execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to alleviate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's era, and Trump says that these measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing of ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of ISIS' leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Based on suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
Neste's Managing Director: Renewable fuels did well
Oil processor Fluid's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year the comparable operating profit was improved by the tax relief of the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in the release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kg, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, WBO's master of the upper feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the first four-weight world champion with the unanimous decision of Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7:00 on Saturday.
When the two posed to photographers, the manager of Lomachenko, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to the lightweight show.
He's got to get into a lightweight series [61.2 kilos] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's do what they want."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the match should be organized on a pay-TV channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut later this year in the lightweight series and fight next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be fighting in the lightweight Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the pay-per-view channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we can reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an incredible fighter" and that he might be going to see the game on Saturday.
Lomachenko interrupted the praise for Garcia's gullet and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout.
Garcia said he was focused on showing the punch force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being fought more and more.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey's a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary 5 300 euros, training what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last time Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisor at the banker's shop spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
Tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements defined in the Act.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment firms carry out their own APV1 or APV2 qualifications.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of the qualifications of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, whose study group is composed of experts from both Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both exams are "rare in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, reports that the pass percentage of exams is roughly approximately 70.
Of the employees of the largest banks, about all investment firms have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are mandatory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers, without mentioning names, whose staff seems to have avoided completing their qualifications," Savikko says.
He says there are "a few" bankers like this.
According to Savivo, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees recommended to investment advisors by approximately 3 000 persons.
Some bankers consider that a degree is an advantage.
More sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation in the financial sector requires the completion of APV degrees, as it is then that the investment sector competence is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commission, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average wage for regular working hours of monthly employees is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in jobs earn more than €5 900 a month and women earn more than €4 500 a month.
On average, the tithe of those making the most money earns about 8 100 euros.
The tithe of men making the most money earns more than €9 000 a month or more, one tenth of women making the most money earns €6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been relied on at the level of employees and duties.
According to Fiva, individual cases of insufficient professional competence and competence of the investment advisor were encountered during its audit.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if their skills and qualifications are at a low level.
The situation has been wild and free on this point.
More sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements," Savikko says.
According to Savigo, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened up by the new MiFID II Directive.
It requires each undertaking to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, in turn, should be given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva's market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to tied agents selling products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided on in this perspective during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing training.
All of this must be documented and the company has a duty of proof of this that this has also been done.
The Court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel's positions at individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline, if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, this change will tighten the rules and make them more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner "drawing" a giant plane over the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out on Thursday 787 on a Dreamliner, using which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, the plane leaving Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 km, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the United States' borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming school students don't feel rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen pedaled persistently with the help of the swimming pool
Iines Kaikkonen made good progress, Taina Itkonen followed.
The Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next week.
Although it sometimes rains and then shines again, young swimmers are not bad at all, Taina Itkonen, the leader of swimming schools, boasts.
This week's swimming schools have a total of 13 children, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the doctor will begin, and Itkonen will evaluate it.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised jointly by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liete beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with the swimming tables, someone without a doubt.
Small siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first suspected going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to pedal toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me that she had been swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the waterfront is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming with swimming tables was persistently practiced by Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, four, once in a while he wanted to go to the water war.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swimming from the beach, sees the beach swimming school as a good start for swimming.
No matter what the weather may have been, Anna has loved to come here every day.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
The swimming school kids packed up at the pier.
The boys had a lot to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking fruit and frying the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry at the pier.
You know, when you don't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes, "Here's a story that connects."
You can see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a cleaning product manufacturer, launched a series of Unknown Soldier products a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks and a "wc brush on the edge of the brush."
This autumn, an unknown soldier is referring to the premiere of the film and the marketing of the film.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been insulted in social media: When will the Unknown-Health Ties come?
I have to call the company and ask them what this is all about.
What about Aino Määttä, Vice President of Siniproduct?
We're the film's partner.
We're here to support this film, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," Määttä says.
According to him, the products become special performances and the film becomes visible.
Isn't there something a little funny about this... often when you think that there's something in common between the products and the stories connected to them?
Yes, there is a story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products," Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is no stranger to military culture," Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichys have been launched, which are called Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already made by Kalle Kinnunen, blogist of Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time for further action.
For example, Valio, the Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not revealed their war products yet.
The new results of the Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were published
The latest results of the Swedish asylum seekers' medical age tests have been published. The results of the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of those tested were found to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Bureau of Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to identify the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the Finnish Legal Service has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of the tests, i.e. in 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases the National Bureau of Legal Affairs determined that the tests were "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is ‘possibly under 18'.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Department of Legal Medicine reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. Big differences in the statistics of previous months are not visible," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and indicated that 442 cases had ‘references to the fact that the study is 18 years old or older'.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that 243 cases had been openly told by the applicant that it was turning 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints, and then dentists and radiologists analyse the images.
One of the sceptics is the Karolininen Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Bureau of Legal Affairs defended the accuracy of the tests: "You can generally say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test is about to turn 18 and the risk is about 10 per cent."
Joy collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent 30 sections of Mikko Ilona's performance strip downwards in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left in 11th place on Saturday, but was found at the end of the tour, giving 41 places.
In the difficult weather, the joy accumulated a double bog with three bogs.
The others were having a hard time.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, got up to share one of the top positions in the under-par round, even though he told me that there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
The round was brutal, but I hung along and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia is changing party
On Thursday night at the Trump campaign event, Democratic Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced a change of party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thorough reflections, I can tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Governor of the Democrats."
The crowd began to flaunt the applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owned coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of Republicans (RNC) published a statement on Thursday evening that "the change of governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than better America."
"Democrats only have 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," said Ronna McDaniel, representative of the RNC, in his statement to CBS news.
Lightnings sowed damage - Thursday becoming even the most thunderstorm day of the summer
The rest of the week we will also get more thunders in Southern Finland.
During the past week, thunder has thundered especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the most thunderous day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, lightning has taken place especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest of Finland.
With a furrow, lightning struck the power center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The Rescue Department received a report of a fire at about 15 minutes until midnight on Wednesday.
The electric center was located in the sauna room at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department broke down the roof and wall to find the firehouses and put out the fire quickly.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
In Loimaa, lightning set fire to the outside building on Harjulantie before midnight.
By the time the Rescue Department arrived, the building was already at full fire, and the Rescue Department could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An outdoor building about 50 square feet [50 sq m] in size burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a detached house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The emergency services were there to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't cause a fire - only a few fuses blew.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information on the defect was received between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses during that period.
It was only shortly before 5 p.m. that the problem was corrected.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on a thunderstormed section of the track.
Lightnings have sowed destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been a total disaster! evaluated meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small lightning balance of the summer, many even feel strong.
This might seem like a real thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to the thunderstorms of this summer," Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, there were 1,700 skimmings, and Thursday has had potential even for the hardest day of the summer: by around 4:00 p.m., the park had 1,790 lightnings.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than 2,000 lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings in the year was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning rate had risen to 18,386 salami.
So there is still something to catch so that this year does not break the record of two years ago.
But you can expect the thunderskir to continue.
According to Tuoviinen, air mass over Finland will also remain warm and wet during the rest of the week, which is an acceptable source environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunders is expected to move from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
A more united rain front is to be found in the centre of the earth.
According to Tuoviinen, it only thunders very rarely in such cases.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world sports boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made following the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia's ban on participation.
At the IAF Congress on Thursday on the eve of the World Cup, Dmitri Shljahtin, the Russian athletics director, said that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry 'for all the athletes who were stolen from the competitions for gold or silver medals'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report had provided evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Association of Athletics acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to restructure its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we will have to do everything possible to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on the status of neutral athletes at the World Championships in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Mr Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet a number of requirements before its status could be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the banned coaches continue to operate freely," he told the journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland didn't turn out to be the success the authors wanted," says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, confess that the film was produced in an interview with Annika Sucksdorff Yle, Managing Director of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100 000 viewers, which is less than the film budget, about EUR 5 million.
It's not a lottery win, but it's important now that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have had their money already.
Now we have to wait for small brooks of foreign distributions," Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The restrictions on the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive player transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair-play economics rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to close the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer money and joining him in its starguard, as the company finances the royal family rich in Qatar's oil.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced with real revenue in order to avoid loss-making football-related business.
The economic rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the French President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners drew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's first business model in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of evaluation of the financial rules of fair play will last until 2018. During this period, clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave UEFA president in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, in charge of fair play economics at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may account for the amount for the entire duration of his new contract.
As Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recorded as EUR 44.4 million per annum over the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were passed on to PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 period instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through the companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports the PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid to PSG by the Qatari Tourism Authority was over-estimated.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be financed by the fees available from the 2022 World Football Organization Commission.
However, the PSG and the Organization Commission have denied that Neymar would be the ambassador to the World Cup. UEFA would be very easy to expose such an arrangement.
Due to the past sanctions imposed by the PSG, UEFA will follow even more closely the attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, available sources reported that UEFA did not negotiate with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press press on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorised to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was more than EUR 10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of social networking products and jerseys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to be transferred, allegedly violating the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed football's operating environment over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
We are now in a hurry: Finnish sports coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-time defector Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki even though he should be coaching at the World Championship in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow at the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä on Saturday at the three-strike qualifier.
However, the two-man coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organisers as a documentary, but also has not been enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or what, coach manager Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone in the stadium looked at the stepmarks, Arttu Pajulahti said his coach could be left behind.
The World Championship Medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
Athletics World Championships will start in London today on Friday and will last a good week ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are among the species that Finnish sportsmen and sportsmen can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prize to another, in which experience is matured to the point where the adult World Championship is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, and yet there are no old-timers.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can occur.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glues them to watch the games, even though London medals are not settled until late in the evening due to the time difference.
In 2015 Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in athletics.
It was brought by Spear Thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The braves expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the results of the recent events of him and the other shooters and the fact that Pitkämäki was left in the qualifiers last summer.
Whatever happened to these games, Pitkämäki will be a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt for Finland's athletics in the coming years will give you a great success in the youth international championships this summer too.
Processing young talent and supporting its work financially is more important than maintaining a small elite group of professional athletes.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both training and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Let us hope that the London Games will remain in the history of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi, second in Copper's Big Air, "But yes, I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in a race, and that was very close to succeeding.
I feel good, and I feel good now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite well.
From now on I'm going to try it again at the games, think Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express vessel frozen in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new express vessel FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6:00 p.m.
There was a loading on board around eight o'clock.
The ship arrived late in Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on the ship.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting for boarding at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical malfunction on the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting in their cars.
Viking's communications manager, Christa Grönlund, tells IS that there was a technical failure on the side.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
The 42-metre special transport is disrupting traffic on Route Six on Thursday night.
42 meters long special transport is moving from Muuko to Mustola harbour during Thursday night.
The transport leaving at nine o'clock should be there by 11:00 p.m.
The police are directing traffic on Route Six, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the hill to the port of Mustola, the transport is proceeding along route 13.
Small district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story has both the glory days of the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (about that time David Wain and Michael Showalter did a great series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant recollection that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for a long time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (which included the background story of H. Jon Benjamin speaking in a vegetable can).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as adult lustful teenagers, and highlighting it makes reaching the past impossible part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodises stalker movies of the '90s, such as the horror movie Hand rocking the cradle.
One of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not been over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so Michael Showalter) as his accomplice, George H. W. Bush (who is aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are side paths.
It's especially funny to see the age-old Paul Rudd, who has a beard pat under his lower lip from Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie Singles.
The moments of random madness may elevate this series as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: the cold war spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalog, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It's made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, where the Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The lead is the tough Gregor and idealistic Iosef of Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubanted in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
The series contains some good visual jokes (police spend time watching TV chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors involved, including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in imitation of clumsy socialist drama – for example, there is a killer hiding behind Reagan mask. That's why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In short, the series could be better used as agitprop satir, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating burgers.
A message to an imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were numbing our recent history and their history as well.
The Kouvola Toni Tauru will rise to the ring in Macao on Saturday against the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru has a hard bone against Macau, as Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, fought in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the World Cup of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against a parent.
It's a funny story, says 32-year-old Tauru.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were brought to China's Autonomous Region of Macao on a quick schedule.
That's never been the case before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It pissed me off because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter is pleased, however, that a new date was reached for the struggle.
Waiting for the week doesn't really affect the preparation.
The transfer won't affect the condition, because it won't improve in a week.
The condition can get worse if you practice too much now.
In the last few battles, the Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in the fight.
This time it's different.
Issaa Kouvolan describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come hard in the first round and try to take it to the carpet.
He's won the Jujitsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvola's last fight didn't go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Tauru in the eye, and the victory was left in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when I'm standing. He didn't get a shot.
When I went down, he hit my eyebrow.
It was a real pain in the ass for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some go into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought for the last time in September.
Last year, Tauru had three matches.
Now the second battle of this year is ahead.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've been training and in good shape the whole time.
But the only reason I've been fighting is because of the fight.
When a 32-year-old learned of a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was working out in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good practice with this guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, since on Saturday a Kouvolan has to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been allowed to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You've got to hit him rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take you to the property myself.
You can't give down for free because they consume the most.
Macau attracts a Tauru who fought in China before.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, fancy evening in front of you.
The Bank of England keeps interest at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been inexhaustible and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank has moved interest rates because of the increasing pressure on family income.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25%, which received less support this month as economic growth has been impotent.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that household income levels would be under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to increase to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation rate driven by Brexit, and the bank also announced that the cost of loans could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide preferential financing to the banks by means of the Programme of £15 million more, i.e. a total of £115 million.
The Bank's decision on interest rates states: "The Commission's forecast for monetary policy is that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as real household income declines in consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for a "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation, and the expectations of the market "a little wider".
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be ‘gradual' and ‘limited'.
In May, the Bank forecast an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and was USD 1.31. It declined by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates cushioned the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and according to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even further before it improves.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" a fall in income over the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the shock of the EU's referendum, which pushed the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the Central Bank, interest rates had become increasingly demanding as inflation tightened the pressure on households. Three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation slowed down to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, its 2 % target level was exceeded due to a ‘total' weak pound.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be increasing as creditors are frantically seeking customers and wanting to close the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also unexpensive options."
The NHS prescribes to 10 000 controversial anti-HIV medicines
As of September, patients may be prescribed a ‘reversible' anti-HIV medicine. In the Supreme Court, a dispute was brought to an end regarding the funding of the medicine in the UK public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of the trial and that pre-coitus drug has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the medicine PrEP, although it claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, director of the UK NHS, called the announced decision "a major new intervention" on Thursday, and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "a crucial moment of resolution".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for an experiment that will be extended to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine taken prior to sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high-risk groups.
A medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection during sexual intercourse.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group is gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics will select eligible candidates for the trial from men, women and transgenders, as well as from those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and registered for general care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and this week the UK NHS signed a contract for medicines following an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
"This important new intervention should complement and intensify the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," Stevens says.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the struggle of more than 30 years to solve one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV", says Deborah Gold, Director of National AIDS.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those in need and at risk, it can have a revolutionary effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, risk groups will receive an NHS-funded trial of medicine that they can decide independently on without the need to negotiate with a partner; it will have a empowering effect which will improve the lives of very many people.
This is welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect 10 000 people at risk from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that lasted for several months because of the government's slow-down," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been halted."
Quality of living: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker interested in the renovation of properties, moved from Knightsbridge's residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house of the style of Queen Anna's era, and the success of the renovation is that Joanne has not yet packed up and moved.
"Before this, my ex and I lived in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the house display and found that the rooms were as high as the one I had at the time.
I fell in love immediately and made an offer the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square feet [90 sq m] has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room room where only the kitchen could enter the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space and a middle floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Notting Hill in Azad. Erfan was assigned to take advantage of the space of rooms nearly four metres high and to create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking on the part of Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complicated.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that you don't have to crouch in them.
The structures had to be adapted so that the height is just right on top and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the interlayer you will find the copper-crossed window of Retrouvius in an elegant lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage luminaires create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrics, the feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
Adding to the style is the fact that you can hide the kitchen when you don't use it.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about the steel-steel MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily into place."
With the rational use of space and the design of storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and a better layout.
"When selling a property, the area determines – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"As a matter of principle, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The household is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional link to the dwelling is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"Nobody's getting attached to electrical wires running through the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the base apartment exceptional.
Then it can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Princess Sofia, who was pregnant, was beaming in her summer look.
Princess Sofia's choice of costume hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented me at the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue body-like outfit, which was a wonderful dress for the last pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event Sofia will represent before she is born.
His due date is September.
Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress for dinner.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue was a great dress for the princess.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia was just irradiated in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited about talking to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her late pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in the Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
They didn't have the guts to taste it. They just walked by.
In the booth food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentila, among the acquaintances Panja.
He didn't know much about Finnish, and the Finns didn't know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Gulfs to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Try some, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai cafeteria in Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the mall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said that the self-made pastes smelled too much in the hall.
There's a new location at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we slobberers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times will we shyly ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her clients.
He'll be told where we've been and who we've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the customer's life cycle varies and the food society changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me thin and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to have lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat by the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
Besides our sense of taste, he has opened up our thoughts and hearts.
Many people now speak Thai to him thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though she's had a hard time, she's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
He works at restaurants. He goes to mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the two decades of fulfillment.
We customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention went through this remarkable day, in front of the job.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, the security authorities received an important list for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains information from more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of everyone.
More than 130 of the persons mentioned on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The Night Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have become more accurate.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorist identities and pictures while investigating the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities evaluated the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
There is also a list of specialised terrorist activities.
For example, in the case of the 27-year-old German Sami J., Abu Assid al-Almani, a German name.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later through Turkey to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber is written next to his picture.
There's no more accurate information about the man's fate.
In total, some 6 000 fighters from Europe have taken up the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews with the Rescue Department, he wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday in Tokoinranta in Helsinki, a person under water was rescued.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter on call at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A diver at the Rescue Department found him under the surface," Estlander says.
The emergency services received a report after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
According to his interviews, he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mr Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also well instructed by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars hit nine people in Eura cars, three were seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were less injured, says the on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when another car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says the firefighter on call.
According to the emergency services, there is a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are arguing over Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, which is linked to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak value zone just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate assets when they bought a shop on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
There the family founded the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying force and the central character of the family".
According to the court documents, the property distribution ratio means Colin owns real estate worth some $316 million and Paul worth some $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
Now the brothers are also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, but he blames Paul for the poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is my priority," Colin says in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of depositions, e-mails and reports, and there are consulting companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a real estate in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started a store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two boys in the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. Colin said that Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile even though he is a former member of the Australian Football League Society Board and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to this biography of 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and in his text message he told me that he couldn't really comment on it because it's being tried in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight like this," Colin continued and said that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be resolved in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff is planning to restrict the president's media use.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the White House's new chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news surveillance so that the boss doesn't get into so much trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff at the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit the information available to President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through her because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to restrict Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of television relations — and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump became upset about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with matters more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor in Trump's campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico's journalist Tara Palmeri then wrote that "according to six former campaign workers, it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praises".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know – maybe Trump's tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff at least a few times have been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing the fuss.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to pursue their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher reported on an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can become immensely infuriated by press games in which he is criticized – especially if they are about harmful leaks of information, and then he is forced to know where the information comes from.
That's what happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on the GotNews.com web site, established by Internet pharmacist Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun to ask the staff about Walsh after reading the case."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House's staff secretary, Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump".
And what was the result again?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own business.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league, EUR 222 million to buy out the football.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved and was free to move to the Parisan society PSG.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, costing EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company in Qatar.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Succeeding author Raija Oranen, with hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flying, has beaten me: "I'm fine in my life"
From the TV series Rose's time and Clean White Sheets Raija Oranen, a famous success writer, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandkids take Grandma so in addition to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring there was also a rental apartment.
In the light and sun, out of the old circles, Rajan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
Even the outer appearance is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medication was stopped, they were mood drugs.
Alcoholism helped me at one time with hypnosis, which also worked on fear of flying, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have travelled together for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in tourism, have been going together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, and Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama she's always been, ending her life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a major career as a writer, only remembers 44-part clean white sheets of a TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work in the clothing industry of the Fresh Family Company when I read Alice Seppälä's 50-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I was a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it," Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer in active time, she has many manuscripts working on - ideas of hundreds.
The circulars returned across the ditch to the "millionaire alley"
The wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands are once again on their hairs with the persistent vagrants who managed to cross the municipal ditch and return to the field next to the houses.
Tourers parked some 20 caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat they needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reports that the Travellers came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"The municipality needs to be tough on action because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them last night and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travellers returned so soon after being driven away.
"There are more of them, and they have even laid down a horse in a grazing park."
According to a spokesman for Solihull County, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are about to take the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry People Surrounded Portugal's Accident Machine
In Portugal, men who made an emergency landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the crash.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
At its earliest, it can be taken 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, a small aircraft flown by men had to make an emergency landing on the shores of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of them running away from the landing plane into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man who had his back on the plane.
Immediately thereafter, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told the magazine Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who got killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents weren't hurt.
The beachers surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began beating its tail, reported Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash landing.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his foot won the World Cup again: "Without disaster, I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland's time early Wednesday morning at the World Banked Slalom competition in Big White, Canada.
The Great Hamari also won the World Cup in the past.
A total of three World Cup titles have already accumulated.
That's a hell of a World Cup!
Two times we were treated for gold, time with good heart rate, the phone reached the Great Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new calculators.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
She had been zealously counting since she was young with her friends, and the accident did not take her desire to get on the slope.
You know, it reminds me from time to time, what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that if you don't mind.
Those cards are played, which are shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to say that a serious accident and the loss of a limb would be a stroke of luck, and the Great Hamari will not do so.
But he turned a terrible difficulty into a favor.
Yes, I'd say it was a win-win situation.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Grand Hamar's greatest passion for rafting was already waning.
It wasn't until after the accident that I started my job towards the top.
When I was a kid, I used to work out with my friends, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in the X-Games startup.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and get bitter and sad."
I decided to pull my overalls off and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize at the sports gala in January.
Great Hamar says that the Star's victory is an important signal for the parasports people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch the sportsman campaign of the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's year?
We'll see about that.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Still, the Great Hamar has not conquered all the peaks he desires.
Next year will be a major goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
They're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump regime is not seen to bring about a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications office chain Burson-Marsteller studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syria Refuges surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18 to 24 responded to the survey, half of which are women and half men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents could think of returning to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and by the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return, while a quarter feel that leaving the country would be the most important.
Only less than one-tenth raise the main factors affecting the decision to improve the economic situation or to leave Syria with Bashar al-Assad.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important to end the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A good quarter of al-Assad's presidency stands in the way of a peace treaty.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
The only way to solve the conflict is by means of military action alone.
The majority of Syrian young refugees see the power of ISIS weakened over the last year, while one fifth feel that its power has been strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS and terrorism in general is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many made military measures and educational reform a priority.
A fair tenth believes that the most important thing is to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's period.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a company in Espoo, is developing an open source database that is "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of the encoder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius's MariaDB does not cost users anything at all, and it can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge mass of information remains in order and quickly available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's technology leader, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen helps to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun with $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced their departure.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB at this stage.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the Sun's top 20 developers to ensure that the continuity of the code is secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL these verifications were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenus and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 per cent per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's CFO.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is scarcely worded about the company's key figures.
To that extent, she reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates to receive EUR 20 million in orders.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be over a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they're versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Just because we're a small company doesn't mean we don't have any connection to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, gamblers such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit rapidly growing seals.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach $1 billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open databases or at least a transition would have started.
Large companies do not get new customers because most of them will choose an open source code next.
This has led to licence fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as previously with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have swallowed price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult, because their old applications and others are locked up in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer's size is about to be filled.
When licence fees increase each year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major systemic changes when they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and now intends to recruit more.
One of the reasons for EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in, for example, Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to switch to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is saddened by how money is spent on closed healthcare systems in Finland when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source code is ideology, but I think it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot or cannot do.
In addition to another Finnish developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models over open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy is stepping up its attitude towards non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea on their ships that they will not be allowed to continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had seized the German ship of the Jugend Rettet, a crew suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year's aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organisation announced in a statement published in social media.
"We can only judge the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet.
The crew is suspected of having taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who had their boats re-used.
One such incident is claimed to have taken place only a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, as evidenced by a prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who monitors the operation.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct is Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Frontiers.
Mr Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees it as evidence that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He revealed that this month plans to continue discussions with the mayors of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
A seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner at Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - case to the prosecutor
Suspected crime was committed at Enontekiö Kuttanen last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has been reported in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect, after what he did, would have fled with two dogs into the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist the capture.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in the district court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, famous for Harry Potter and All Hairy Friends series, is dead.
Robert Hardy, the British girl, died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his acting career at the age of 24 at the theatre.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in a television series All Hairy Friends based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that she was considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the verdict and was allowed to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened with 20 years' imprisonment, but his lawyers say that both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a tearful look at the earth.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was caused by "the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level" and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, where she said, "Not a day goes by that I won't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this. I will do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that he is "stalking" about the idea that he will never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never let go," Camdy said.
There seems to be a precedent for this case, since there is no law in Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Shide yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Few have defended Carter, one of whom is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper in which he states: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary General of NATO: The worst in Russia since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to avoiding tension.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump of the United States was able to find that the relationship between the United States and Russia had even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for the bad relations between the two countries to be welcomed by Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The head of BMW said that the company believed that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown, Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to the engines of over 3 million Mercedes in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been heavily marketed by European car manufacturers in order to achieve the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of neutralising emissions will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of supporting large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, and Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to the standard tests.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent the European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars has a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The Venezuelan vote started a fraud investigation, big demonstrations were coming.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion of a firm that has no role in the election results, as Tibisay Lucena, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a controversial vote was held in order to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed their own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, on Wednesday evening the national security forces began to take over the country's parliament building.
The forces are meant to ensure the security of the appointments.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease - carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is completely endangered in Provence because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked reduction in the rainfall in spring and especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPAM Research Institute in Provence, which specializes in agriculture.
"This will shorten the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area that spread micro-organisms."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer essential oil components."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and by developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist is a growing threat in Mexico
The weekly edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: to leave the children at home or to include them in a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists to name names for each group.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels, criminals who make Mexico's chaos a threat to news.
According to the Journalists Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. Under federal protection there are 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened. In the past year at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
The front of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. It says, "Right." The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts, which are decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a panama hat made up of trademarks.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and their paranoid fears.
A federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal in particular with journalists' cases, but to date, according to the Journalist Protection Committee, only two prosecutions have been filed.
Journalists' murderers rarely go to trial, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime a year, but few end up in court.
Riodoce's journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the capital of the State in Culiac on 15 May 2017.
In his red Toyota, he had only driven a couple of blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left in mourning by a wife and two grown children.
Rumors move fast and squirm freely in Culiac.
But we're quiet about Valdez's death.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has the decorative double - story tombs of drug lords that are larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival group that is waging a war against the Guzman boys.
The Guzman boys may have been pissed off by this case: every issue of the magazine was purchased by customers suspected of being members of the gang as soon as the paper came to the sales desks.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem", says Bojorquez.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its news in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Journalist Protection Committee for his courage to follow Mexico's story of drug trafficking without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Journalist Protection Committee prize.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The supplier must accept the task that falls upon him – or act foolish.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker – and they miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to an El Guayabo bar across the street and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines killed him.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the story," says Bojorquez.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that things aren't right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression may fail, and so it happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40 - degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises in a four - story building in the middle - class area of Culiac.
Some of the journalists were half-played about whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state considered unreliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
The boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that government spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block away from the D.A.'s office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have received much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, one of which "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid military raids.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column provided reliable information about the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco", Ohukainen because of his slender physique.
"Now all communications to our informants are down."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists have been kept.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took along a few signs the following morning when she left for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor's office, which was again responsible for the murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoaca three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations on sidewalks and buildings, "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked for him to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organized crime, crime - permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the border state of Tamaulipas in the north six years ago.
There was a note signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut off head, there were computer keyboards and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the border state of Chihuahua in the north after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a note on his front page for drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to Ruben Espinosa, a photographer who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who was once to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's journalists sat in front of the delivery at midnight on the sidewalk on a beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly their phones began to vibrate as a sign of the message.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan's beach resort, 19 people had died.
The war accelerated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be redoed the next day.
Sirens howling nearby — another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where a man gives a finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about shutting down the business. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked to go out on the street and do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "A tough place"
In April, Hannu Manninen's 39th birthday party was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic era.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May went practically completely when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally a child's disease such as an ear infection that I had to take an antibiotic course.
I was able to make only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was hard when I couldn't make use of my practice enthusiasm," Manninen tells Evening Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion received the training permit only in the second week of June, as reflected in the competition and top sports research centre KIHU's roll mat test of 12 June.
In the test, an athlete skis with roller skis on a carpet with a speed increase every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the tip of the athlete's finger with a needle.
Last fall I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
Fired against the wall, Manninen says.
♪ For the better ♪
After his undergrads, Manninen tells me he's been healthy.
I've done many peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week episode back there.
Midsummer was also a week and a half off flight duties.
My family and I have time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manninen was 18th on top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have drawn up a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for different rhythms compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three world Cup Games.
In December it would be at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list," Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth winter Olympics already.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 with gold in the team competition celebrating the Nummelian emphasis.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by disguise
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first results of research on a creature the size of a rhino found by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that researchers could even determine that its scaly skin was red-brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the most preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists view this amazingly well - preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to examine his findings more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
For six years, the wild beast was dug up in a 300-pound block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs.
Studies of the skin revealed that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red - and - white armor masked its predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter coloring on the top, which still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaurus came to the headlines in May and is now on display in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, the Markmitchelli museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected by a general coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter below.
However, the observation was surprising because Borealope is considerably larger than the animals today with the same coloring.
It suggests that meat - eating dinosaurs caught it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
Of current animals, such as deer, zebras and armadillos, they have the same coloring: they are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The hunting of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Age were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the scales of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was red - brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its bowels to determine what it ate at its last meal.
Researchers believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted to the sea, where it sank on its back into the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to go much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has survived and it has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous Age.
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous Age was an era of thethropods, huge bipeds, flesh - eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years before Borealopeta, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armored dinosaur.
One of the predecessors of Tyrannosaurus Rex was Acrocanthosaur, a six - ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with skin and armor from snout to hip.
The nodosaurus averaged five meters long and weighed as much as 1,300 kg.
Two-foot spikes were raised from their blades.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present West Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in small detail in an undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the pitted plates of armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it seems.
There's still fossilized leather in the bumpy plates of that skull armor.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes upward.
I can also calculate the scales on its sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August.
A day earlier he had come to New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing a sign saying, "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of protestors with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop setting up his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell picked up his six - year - old daughter from his father's house and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years has been the documentary "Whose Streets?". It was premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter in a flower dress and a crown matching it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't stop taking my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow into it.
He must have the ability to act and organize, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living in black, and he must know what we must do to be freed, to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still like all the other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became the camp place for activists, waiting for information on the case and finally finding out that the police would not be prosecuted.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the Association of Minority Nurse Students. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrelli's mind was squirming with suspicion, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was based on the countless occasions when people, usually whites, had appeared in the local community to benefit only from its difficulties and persistence.
"We had heard that the people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said in an interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism among sentenced prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to join the project together with six other locals. The film crew followed the events during the years that followed Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are presented in the film because I am represented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrelli's experiences because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community".
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human imagery of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story goes back and brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders identify with the Queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," says Ferrell. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts constantly.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he points out that Ferrell was not "self-sustained" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have long since left Ferguson, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrelli still has two and a half years of parole left, and he's been convicted of blocking the highway at a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his neighbourhood is brief and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a transnacent and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama relaxed on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit a little theoretical, statement on the customization of DNA data, ambiguity and the causality and identity underlying the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violation of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning who was sentenced to prison: a granular, black and white selfie, where an uncomfortable manning sits in a car in the driver's seat.
Dewey-Hagborg had a highly popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it he created portraits based on forensic data, DNA from cigarette butts and chewing gums, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us about the new exhibition at the press conference.
You couldn't get to Manning's house and you couldn't shoot him in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked him if he was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even wrote together a Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing the future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and would be able to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, which was a fortunate coincidence after seven severe years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leaks and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the strong divisions he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes there's a purpose to everything.
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's great autograph, where the last name (i) is marked by the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic breakdown on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as is the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. His Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them on display here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," the picture says.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive, I still get to chill."
In contrast to the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data as a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height similar to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were once on the wall, but I wanted to make a crowd feel like them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police report that they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The Cook County Court records show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement sent by Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Social Relations, Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the University and Somerville College's spokesman by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to assist the investigating authorities in the United States in every possible way."
The opinion also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we constantly focus our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
He told the police that a call had been made from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in 1008.
The police described the scene as a terrible sight.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published the following information to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the victim's background and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," said the convicted officer.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of gross harassment.
According to the police, the staff at the bookstore called them in on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police for threatening him.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the events at the bookstore, the police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt said to the cops in interrogation.
As a penalty, a man must carry out 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay £620 or around £690 in legal costs and £85 or £95 in compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will bring the WADA road map to a conclusion in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency on the WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the British Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for re-establishing the powers of RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
"All has been announced and all will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer appointed by the WADA.
To that, Mutko said: "The investigation is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit what did not exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, president of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with the Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was "on the right path" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of the innovation that is dear to Finns: "There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packs"
The British organisation questions the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
The BBC and the Guardian, among other things, report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDS, bans the use of its own brochures in UK maternity packs.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
A SIDS means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them because it would imply that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand born.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different causes, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure," said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard as a place to sleep in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if no crib or cot is available.
The organization recommends using the package only for naps and stopping it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and making sure it does not get wet or soiled.
The quick villain ran away from the Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff at the Japanese zoo are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, Western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told us.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about three feet long.
Yamane describes a fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain may travel freely in the farm area.
There's been no sightings of a turtle at the zoo.
The last escape of the villain took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store start-up company, but the queries didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent and objective," Errett says. As her hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to use outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can do surveys and target certain teams and population groups, provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the top management.
"Your own health can be monitored with applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint-startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says that he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to make quick inquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can be used to draw up a map at a glance to see in which departments the workers are most disgruntled and which of the leaders have received the weakest assessments.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has been surrounded by turmoil since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are being harassed and those who talk about problems are being punished.
For startups such as Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value according to the Let's Talk Payments website can reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uber's reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Converter allows companies to make tailor-made queries, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there's any reason to suspect that the director is intrusive, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"General opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convertworld.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences may be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convertworld for over a year because it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, it was the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or email address that could make the notification to the head office. Then he had to file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Chief Legal Officer of Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state; now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the worker's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen's audit firm collapsed as a result of unethical action in the Enron scandal.
Only with the help of social media did the companies realise that they could no longer prevent public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Converter provide their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convertworld have venture capital investors to support them.
In February, Converter raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investment is not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful business.
"Workers are more committed to the company's success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of Employee Compensation and Welfare at LinkedIn.
Investors get profits when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it will be useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered as a sign of change.
And if change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of the management consulting company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company fails to take action, the employees will start to wonder if they were heard
and do their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting personnel surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
After collecting feedback on slow decision-making and quality of communication from frustrated workers, Errett was able to change teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help them to improve the long-term sustainability of their employees in a sector known for their high turnover.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly filming his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging on the end of her window.
The woman said the camera on her cell phone was shooting in the apartment.
The woman who was frightened of the incident had run into another room to dress up.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon thereafter recalculated to the window.
A 20-year-old man who's a suspect in a covert shooting has admitted to filming a woman.
But he said he only photographed her face.
The video on his cell phone had been deleted and the police had failed to recover it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man admitted the act, but denied he had committed the crime.
The man who described it was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as "unfortunately crazy".
According to the news agency, a man is being charged with an incident.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but should be reduced," said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
A temporary cut of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would not involve any cuts in holiday money in any way.
In the municipal sector, contracts should not arise until private sector papers are signed and the percentages of increases are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luukkainen did not reveal yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-skilled negotiating organisation.
Lukkainen: Holiday money cutting increases earnings differentials
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of employees in the public sector is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, temporary holiday money cuts further exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weak are increasing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between pupils and regions continue to increase.
It was a long day for the Bruins players, as the NBA reduced daily exercises from two to one.
It's almost 11:00 in the evening, and a group of UCLA football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the campus's new training courses.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs shine from the sweat after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the university's summer course players return to the dormitory for finals. The next morning they meet at 6:30 at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," says Bruins coach Jim Mora, a little before Monday turns into Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the workload of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started 15 minutes past seven in the evening. It was hard to find room for players already on full schedule.
Limiting training sessions to one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood Coach season that has continued through Mora's six sessions, while the training is taking place at the same time as summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the change in the rules of the NBA, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them up a lot for three or four days, and that is very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes rehearsals to outsiders after camp. It is not easy considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs over the protective net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"The worry is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
There's a lot of money being paid for a video of rehearsals.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to overwhelm it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will take place in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially aims for his third term, but in practice he has contributed to the management of the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and for restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to pursue the goal of amending the Constitution that limited the presidency to two.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
Kagame, however, has also promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up the inspection of facts
Facebook intends to send possible fake news to independent fact-checkers more and more often and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to facts inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news. Many feel that fake news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has arisen in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the presidential elections in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, will support the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, in a separate statement published in Germany, Facebook announced that the facts check will be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide more informedly what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook News Feed in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and will also make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Origin of a comic book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottish castle in Kent County is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of tumultuous history behind it. Now this charming place in the Bewli Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by someone who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says sorely.
"I feel a personal connection as I hold the letter in my hand."
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian Ages. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because fire was then used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
An old-fashioned writer was able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the British National Art Council, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay a little longer than would have been desirable.
He spent days studying Victorian "new" castles, archives, treasures and raritys, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles in moats for centuries.
He traveled around the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with the rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also the illustrious artists of the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotland's closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation's staff were just about to start going through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the extras to the attic.
The archives contained journals, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, here families fought for even one birch.
It occurred to me that I think we should let it go."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, about a man who, shortly after the castle was completed, joined the English peasant monkey in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex states that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant monkey started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start in a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The family's men seem to be quite a rascal. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who could court the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium in the beginning of the 20th century, where only a eutrophic plot remains.
There's a special place in Scotland Castle in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn day."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to avoiding tension.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump of the United States was able to find that the relationship between the United States and Russia had even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for the bad relations between the two countries to be welcomed by Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitchko stops the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
Professional boxing long-term heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitchko ends his career.
Klitchko of Ukraine, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Klitchko, who struck gold, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitchko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitchko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in the 11th round after a wild fight.
Joshua and Klitchko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitchko, however, found no motivation for the match.
I purposely spent a few weeks making a decision so that I could get enough distance from the Wembley game," Klitchko explained in his release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitchko's arguments for making a decision on the video.
Bernd Bönte, the manager of Klitchko, told us in a press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitchko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Since 2009, Klitchko has been dating an actor in the United States named Hayden Panettiere.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitchko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the various unions at the same time.
The weatherman in Finland is under the conditions: "Exploring the feeling"
The pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered during the summer's iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman from her mood.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been in this summer against Minna Nikki, the pole jumper.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been competing and practicing here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place," Nikkanen told me at Paavo Nurmi Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the rehearsals," Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together... whether it's cold stuff or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken my breath away.
There's no point in consuming energy under bad circumstances.
He got into the World Cup with 455 of his hangar jumps.
There's been 445 out there.
It's not the same in London.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday at the qualifier 460.
Why don't you move to work abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the early days.
I got the jump together and the tech standardized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally you've been able to get to the hangar for training. Now the hangar's been closed.
What would be ideal for a race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind will do just as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-officer blunted politicians in Yle: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in its hat and beware of increasing the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 in the first morning of Wednesday.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians' proposals have been raised, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bikes, and Virtanen sees them as election speeches.
They mainly indicate that the elections are getting close because, when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about a divider when you're in debt," Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Virtanen has a long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as budget secretary and then worked as deputy head of the budget department and budget manager.
Last time he retired, he served as Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the projected growth rate of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All fortune-tellers estimate that this is a thorn from which we will start going down in the next year, and Finland is waiting for a 1% increase for decades.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants who know English and who are able to support themselves and who have skills that benefit our economy will benefit from the new application process," Trump said.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
This is Prince Henry and Queen Margareta shot in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, says the Court of Denmark.
Traditionally, rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the Court notes in its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been displeased with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court's head of communication, Lene Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal with his mate.
According to the Court, the queen has long been aware of the wishes of her mate regarding the burial site and understands the decision.
Tragedy on the Road: The car almost hit the highway
Tommy had a common-law husband and two small children on board.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they won't get any money from insurance if the other party isn't reached.
The accident took place at Keimolaportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the Ring III construction site.
Tommi from Vantaa reports that his family had miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and two small children of the couple drove along the highway at Keimolaport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
A white car that almost drove into the side of the family car drove down the acceleration lane from Ring III to the Hämeenlinna route," Tommi says.
If it wasn't for evasive action, the car would have come on top of Tom's.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the backseat were not injured.
One of the children is just under three years old, the other is under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky nothing happened to us.
No one who drove by even drove towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident occurred about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue services staff arrived, and the family was checked for fitness.
The car got ready for redemption.
Tom tells us that he and his cohabiting partner have a low income, and they received family assistance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the other car's information, Tommi says the family can't get any money from insurance.
That's why the family wants eyewitness sightings of the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to kindergarten and work without it," Tommi says.
Tom saw the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the car's license plate was the beginning of the SIG.
If we can't catch the guilty man, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every inch of it now.
Tom hopes that anyone who has seen what has happened or knows something about it will contact the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
Header and case repaired at 9:15: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the second car, according to Tommi, did not come in the lane of those coming in, but almost drove from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relationships by means of humor - The self-expressor will be seen at What?-theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born guidance to the theatre "The One?"
The self-expressionist is a musical theater performance about past relationships and inadequacies.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it still makes you feel good.
The subject is handled by means of humor.
You don't get caught up in bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance was carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges one to consider what a person reveals about himself in getting to know a new person.
Is he playing a role or is he approaching the other coat open?
A plotless act confuses fact and fiction
Jappinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the presentation draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the self-expressor does not directly tell about his own relationships or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixing.
I'm sure my own world of values cares about the show.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the self-detector is drawing a timely picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The music's fitting is Jäppinen and Roka.
The love of the theater came to light in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies theatre expression as director at Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
There's two years in the back, and there's another thing in front of you.
Jappinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The parent of the music classes has been an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, the Linna Theatre in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in steering.
The self-expressor received his premiere last week in Helsinki on Narr stage.
A 45-minute performance should also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study town in Turku.
Self-exposer Kouvola's Who?-theatre at 4.8. at 7 p.m. and 5.8. at 2 p.m. and 7.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - the neckline was broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
For twenty years, the Ace of the Escalade circled the world for hundreds of days a year, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement continued in Lahtela.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of physical activity on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new," says Lahtela.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my house for a year," Lahtela says.
The gift had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the accident.
Driving a bike may sound wild.
But I didn't go for boundaries with it.
It's just so tough as a sport, it's not worth doing too much for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long start as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
She joined the post immediately after her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged her protégé on the slope and in physics tests.
Surprisingly enough, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't make sense either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because for once in real, I just got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll burn out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
If it hadn't been for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started coaching the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed - racing.
I traded motocrosses for Frisbeegolf!
It just got out of hand right away, didn't it?
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not insist that her trainers be like her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it," says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming, and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robotics industry – just as it had begun to feel that 2017 could not get any weirder.
Yes, sir.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the generalisation of sex robots seriously," says Professor Emeritus in robotics and artificial intelligence at Noel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are squirming, but they are already selling quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots with the seemingly warm silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot's own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and to the type and color of fingernails.
Even more worrying is the fact that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example to be shy.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It could be tired, talky or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot, such as a shy and resisting robot.
True Companion compares Roxxy robots to vibrators on its website:
"Women have vibrators. Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their spread and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is an option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and there is a President sitting in the White House who has boasted about harassing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, such as pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly short.
The attempt is made to make sex robots as much like real women (with the dimensions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — nothing that suggests independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, led by the head of ISIS
The head of the extreme organization Isis led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of ISIS' leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Based on suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a picture of common sense.
During Trump's period, it has been repeated to the point of getting tired of the fact that the strong division of voters has also broken up families at everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Trump's ability to connect families has been overlooked.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, and he's a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all know — including the Republican sister with whom he has been arguing over politics for decades — are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but, more generally, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left-wing power, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even worse chance that Trump will normalize the Republicans on the right extreme, who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem to be quite reasonable.
Looking back on Mitt Romney's subdued version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and at least his tax returns we've seen).
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be clear-headed, and it will immediately seem like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Carousel of Central Park, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Carousel's horses are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and animals in terror — are ominous, and the background music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's emblems become disillusioned over time: the prospects of high buildings are getting bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not equal to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not been completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in Northern London. Yet, Ye Old Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it does not count.
The carousel of Central Park, on the other hand, remains a strangely magical experience — even to the extent that two two two - year - olds, one eleven - year - olds and two women in their 40 ' s enjoy it tremendously.
I would have given the merry-go-round a perfect score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store I was asked to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale from one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
It's the same thing in a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but I'm also given the opportunity to combine the 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer servant to put his personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The clerk at the department store smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter. "There was no trust in the management."
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuqi of his duties as coach of the representative team.
The responsibility for coaching is assumed by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current assignments.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously been an assistant coach in Sunderland, for example.
In January, Piccareta, 51-year-old who joined Inter's coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of FC Inter's Board of Directors, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, so that there was no other option at present, Håkans commented in the Society's press release.
The Piccareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for the home match against HIFFK tomorrow.
According to the Evening Words, the team's been in a state of turmoil all over Thursday.
On Thursday morning Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta fought against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violin artist, published a youth picture on Instagram.
Several consternations have been added to the picture, which leads to the conclusion that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself marvels at a young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it right here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, he published a couple of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In one picture, he's seen 20 years ago, in the other he's posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
20 years ago, 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating troubles of previous years.
He was already 14 years old in the hospital for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was not finally discovered until 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to a hospital for chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he received hospital care for cuts on his wrists, according to prison officials, when he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors complained of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp during the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too mild.
The Prosecutor-General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unlicensed campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the State Department later announced the release of Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those who camp outside the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry has informed us that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and milk products may help to relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with IRR are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, Washington University researchers found that essential amino acid tryptophan in protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the research director, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, protecting the body without damaging the sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests found that the immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to cause immune cells to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a connection between the development of the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
"The more tryptophan in mice' diets, the more such immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
When studying immune cells that enhance tolerance, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbials in the intestines of mice, the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When DNA from the intestines of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice in a sterile environment that had no microbial bowels and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, which raised the bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri in fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into resistant cells.
When purified from the liquid, the active ingredient proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped to half the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, a person has the same cells that strengthen tolerance as a mouse, and most of us have the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the bacteria Lactobacillus reuterus cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with IG.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation inside the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"A high level of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuter may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mournho felt Manchester United got a "nero" after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle field player debuted in Manchester United's fight against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea with £40 million, started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last game before United, before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defensive midfield player against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet because he was not on the Asian tour of blue shirts before the start of the season. He managed only 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the start of the league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has the natural thinking ability of football," says Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting lineup for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has given priority to.
"Three out of four – we have to thank the company for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women harassed Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth round of the World Championship to Germany in rounds 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of gambling is high.
Their game was flat in every sector, according to Tapio Kangasniemi, Finland's head coach.
In the first two rounds Finland kept its opponent in a tight position, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany's running the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we could swing along," Kangasniemi said.
The most efficient in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Three matches out of four lost Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury has already sent challenges regarding Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent out subpoenas regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections.
Reuters, a news agency, confirms the announcement earlier Thursday by the Wall Street Journal of the summoning of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the Grand Jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting of Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current White House adviser.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington means the pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist a grand jury in an investigation to investigate Russia's involvement in the presidential elections in the United States and whether Trump's campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury will extend Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send subpoenas and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decide whether or not the case should be brought.
A British inventor microchiped himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand.
The British inventor has been the first in the whole country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now offering a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to meet medical requirements for the installation of the microchip.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also turning the locks on houses and cars into compatible with the microchip, and it's gonna cost £300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the South lawn of the White House to an American production event cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was the attraction at an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials from all 50 states visited the products.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the display included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the HMX-1 naval helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the day before the event, the commander of HMX-1 wrote an e-mail to his commanding officer, who is an assistant commander for the naval flight.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn at 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would start at 3 p.m. and the helicopter would leave the scene only after the lawn was cleared out in the evening between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter were delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be required to take place due to restrictions on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the Time magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the incident was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told that there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you can attend," the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the reform of health care and less state regulation that was being discussed in the Senate at the time.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them in their travels.
But using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president's campaign event back in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials from all 50 states", said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with a centimetre accuracy.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
Unit helicopters were also flying 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other expenses for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman said that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern grass court of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the president's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly allowances, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to the documents from HMX-1, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation," says Walters.
‘The estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
According to a study carried out by the RAND Research Company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former press secretary of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is perfectly appropriate to point this out."
It's not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down at the scene of the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump made jokes to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit the Vaasa track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa has been broken due to a technical failure, says Railway Traffic Centre.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The failure of the traffic control system was caused by thunder.
The railway transport centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new government representative.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court ruling which would prevent the appointment of a new representative body in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the elected representative body is due to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative body was elected for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, a restraining order has been requested for the suspicion of election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation by voting.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the vote on the election told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately one million higher than the number of real voters.
The only candidates were Maduro's allies, and the elected 545 members include Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the Assembly can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutionalization as Maduro's way of strengthening his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise the new representative body.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela sank into an economic crisis following a drop in oil prices.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday when the new delegation is due to begin.
A Russian man surrendered by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States.
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court of Justice in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to almost four years in jail for involvement in a worldwide computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, reports AFP news agency.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence has been served.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs harshly criticized Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be released to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
Fraudsters then used information by continuing to control Internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt down other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in the press release.
Modified at 8:58 a.m.: Corrected for the littering of the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel takes up the lead in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during Narcos' second period of production, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth season of the series will be seen. The third-period trailer has been announced and presents the new villains in the series.
During the third production season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world.
The organisation run by four godfathers is "like Fortune 500", except that there is a little more corruption and violence on the part of the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Albero Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third period of Narcos' production begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuun lighting artist Kari Kola (in Kuavssa) will perform an exceptional work of light art in honour of the UN's first Day of Light in Paris next May.
Kola's doing a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument on its doorstep are illustrated in the work.
In my work, I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the things I feel important visible in concrete terms," says light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am very impressed with the invitation to be part of the first international Light Day and bring light art into the theme day," Kola continues.

Two men fought in a mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into a fight in Espoo at the shopping center in the Big Apple parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver, who drove in a forbidden direction, swung at the driver of another car, and as a result his car started moving, hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car that hit him.
In a preliminary interview, the man admitted that he had caused damage and that he had done wrong.
An article entitled by Timo Soin: "Then came the Flood"
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog post entitled by a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs' governing parties.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, has been known to have used the parable of the Flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the words "after us" or "after me" are left in the history books.
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Mr Haysom, interim director of the UN Delegation for Aid, said that hundreds of women were nominated for elections in the provincial councils, three women were running for Vice President and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," said Haysom in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential election will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as the international forces are entering an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contributions will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it 'eat and flee' tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the big crowds rush through the sights.
Venice is smothered by the quick day trips to the city by tourists.
It is difficult to move on narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historical center, while hotels have replaced homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give them two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide from the Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes the tourism that exists and causes problems for Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50 000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, since ships bring to Venice the income it sorely needs and create a need for many jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been envisaged that cruisers would move further away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, feels that this situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative district, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own business - if not with full autonomy.
Every year, about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Bad traffic on the highway, miles long
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, there has been traffic congestion on the north lane during the return journey on Thursday afternoon.
The area has motorway coating work, which slows down traffic," says Savon Sanomat.
The speed limit for road work is 50 km/h instead of the normal speed of 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had actually progressed at a walking rate in some places during Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon the road work progressed on the side of Lake Siil by the statue of Revelation, the golden goat.
I get along well without that kind of attention
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon landscape.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in her current home country, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre race by going around the track at 51.81.
A month later, he healed the 400 - meter fence race during the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who is diligent in social media, found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
The men around the world began sending pictures of their sexual organs to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runnerswoman would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "fog shots" from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account into a private account, Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
I'm sure you can guess, Luel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the race, but I'm fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, his family moved to Namibia first because of his father's job, then Pakistan.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettumi.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally," said Iuel to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence race.
The leg injury put the snowboarder Janne Korve at risk for his entire career - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice when it doesn't hurt anything"
Now it's been nice to count when nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31 of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the future of his career was at stake.
The injury to the leg had forced the Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg wanted nothing to heal.
The hand had also hit the race slope.
During the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether or not the rafting was going on.
The sponsor deals were off and a lot of things were open," Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the slope.
After that, it was an easy decision to make.
I knew that at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, hell, yeah, this is so much fun, let's just take a couple more chances.
Raven didn't get to count properly until September and October, but after a long bill break, just working out painless has been a big deal.
Only a few of them have gone around.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the rafting for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim four years at one race, and then you'll be feverish for that week.
I'm tired of thinking like that, Raven says.
Today, Raven is racing in the halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races don't keep him on boarding, he always gets on with it when he's in tough company.
According to Korva, the international skiing association has grown in value over the last few years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, this is an important race. There's a lot of visibility.
Of course, I always think appreciation depends on the circumstances and the level of the games.
In Sierra Nevada, Raven is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team.
Team coops, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It'll give you a new power, Raven's thinking.
There's still some way I can keep up, but otherwise, no, that's the amount of power in my friends!
In the background of the ferry career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Coach legend Pekka Korve's son is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for whom he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, that's all the time I've got.
But every day I look at at least the nutrition results and usually some departures," Korpi says.
According to Korva, ravishing and nutrition training are a potential career plan when the rafting career comes to an end.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's probably an option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and develop, and maybe in the summer there'll be some departures.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The ravi stories also include the Elitloppet event organised with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet restaurant.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There is still a few months to go, let's hope we can fill the ship," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Ester is the name of a new 41-seat care home for older people to be built on Kite.
The building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbor's Health Road.
In crystal, the common wonder is where customers are enough for the new treatment unit, because now many private care homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Manager of the Care Services, commented that in the future there will be more demand for Kite not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better," Flink says.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerikka.
The transaction concerned business, but the property is reported to have a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move functions away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Department of the GMB of the British General Trade Union, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie's brand, reported that it invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives "will be the first to be told" if there are changes in the operations.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to ‘reply concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines'.
Drew Duffy of the GMB Trade Union finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as the rising cost of living of Brexit, and the constant reduction in production, the East Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production sorely."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had received a letter from the trade union only the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our business activities and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the advertiser, the company has invested more than £5 million in Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the plant's operations."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying £189 million to close the contract, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most talked about event of the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of settlements. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as the PSG offers him over £500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona is known to be enraged by the operation of the PSG and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the company. A source close to Barcelona tells us that Neymar has been taking very good care of the company since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best-player clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they want our players, we will become their opponent and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they want our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have committed precisely this: it expressed interest in the PSG's middle field player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

The calls Trump was making were made up by a White House publicist, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed calls with both the Mexican president and the head of the Scout organization have proved to be made up.
The White House publicist Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty big accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, they happened face to face, Sanders explained.
Talk to Boy Scouts Disappointed
On Monday, Trump reported that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump's success in eliminating illegal immigration.
Trump said that Pena Nieto told us that few people are still crossing the southern border of Mexico because they know that the journey is still blocked to the US border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release stating that the call in question had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
There Trump was thrilled at his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scout organization announced that it was not aware of a call from any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, Michael Surbaugh's previous statement, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the scout organization's meeting gave rise to a lot of wonder, for it was exceptionally political in nature.
Among other things, he was thrilled by the results of last autumn's presidential election.
