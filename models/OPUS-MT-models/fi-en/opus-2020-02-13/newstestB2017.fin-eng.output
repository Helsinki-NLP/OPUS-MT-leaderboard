A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall.
Only recently a 28-year-old cook who moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase at a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reports the San Francisco Bureau of Law.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the CBC radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who used to be a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're very sorry," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in the hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and with a great heart.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-44444.
Striked junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are mainly responsible for specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in the dispute over a new contract of employment.
The Committee on Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Trade Union for Doctors (BMA) is requesting support from its entire government for further labour-fighting efforts starting in early September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the Members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published a letter on Twitter to JDC members, where she says that the government has been "obsessing" about the issues that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC Government has voted against a whole new draft agreement and calls for a new formal negotiation of all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the government of JDC has today submitted a formal request to the government of BMA requesting permission for progressively expanding industrial action since early September."
Because of the controversy, junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawia, director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract that BMA had recommended.
Ms Malawia told members of the BMA at the meetings before the vote that the agreement was a good one and that it should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and bring to an official conclusion the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin received his Turkish brother in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even on his own abstinence standard.
However, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin – five times according to one report.
I couldn't keep track of myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian client has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the event was fierce.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations made by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas dominated by ISIS in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
The official message from Peter, however, was that it is time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only held so that Mr Putin received the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
In this way Russia could gain some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown last month in a failed coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be sighing about relief when air transport can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in the financial magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes that the West is subdued in its reaction to the attempted coup d'état.
Not to mention the old resentment over Turkey's EU accession negotiations and Putin's interference, which is eager to exploit cool intervals and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able, by their summit at the practical seaside palace, to convey the image described by one analyst as 'an alliance of outsiders': two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that, after almost three hours of opening negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a total disaster caused by the NATO member country, Turkey, when shooting down a Russian fighting machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are once again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced by providing only back-office services in the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to retreat when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that period, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands into the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but no RBS is used.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, except for head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because we are now turning into a bank of many different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President of the Bank.
"It would have been very derisive three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put the brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory.
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3 000th victory in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night in the course of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race running on a smooth track.
He's been the same since Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who once won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family's here, too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because it was here that I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humility."
Dettori takes cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the day, and it is no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical skill is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race, his enthusiasm and his cutbacks have brought fans to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori vented his accomplishments in a symbolic way by flying off his horse.
"From flying goals to flying landings Frankie Dettori has been a model of British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won numerous major games, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned as a result of drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had a starter problem, but he showed admirable strength of character, looked to his skeptics and returned to his best.
And for a while now he's not ending his career – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years old."
Putin fired Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a press release from the Kremlin, President Putin ‘decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian presidential administration', but no justification was given for his dismissal.
Anton Vaino was appointed as Deputy Head of the Mission of Ivanov since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
The persecution, born in Tallinn in 1972, was graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol department and the government office, reports the Kremlin's Russian - speaking website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you issue will be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a Russian state television meeting with President Putin, they both said that Ivanov would withdraw at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, few are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Is that the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
In the meantime, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Head of the Security Service of the KGB's replaced Federation (FSB), Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
As Putin entered power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second period, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to Dmitri Medvedev, a close associate of Putin.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to office only three and a half years later.
"Criminal Minds – FBI investigators" star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported kicks in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner of the series Gibson had made an apology on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.
"We had creative differences.
I am sorry that this has happened," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reports ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production period, 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a Friday press release.
"I hoped that I would see the end of the series, but it is no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans the series could ever have wanted."
The 12th production season of the series will start in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windfish that have been caught in the land as a landscape of a hurricane.
Bain, 500 meters [500 m] from the seashore, released footage of the vision in Periscope, hoping to get an answer to the appearance of these five - inch [5 cm] fish.
Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the land bridge of Queensferry bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "folders" which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the cabinet minister responsible for the economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in building the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel being used to build this bridge section alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to receive its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak of the road and water sector.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower road deck, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the ground) gap.
This was done by pulling the north side of the land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive operation, and at the same time it required great precision.
Massive due to the length and weight of the land bridge of 222 metres and approximately 6 000 tonnes, it had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3 %.
And it requires great precision because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports the miraculous rescue of three men.
Three men on their fishing boat out front of Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
The Marine Rescue Station of Moelfre RNLI issued an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew discovered an accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat orbiting right next to them and imagining the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had, fortunately, driven the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted in the buoy and without a life vest.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men on the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat's engine had an emergency extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had been detached from the man driving the boat when it fell.
They were really lucky."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many have lamented why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, it was only TV viewing that took time, then video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made into a cartoon series, cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for Pokémons with their smartphones, which are monitored using GPS. When Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (by using a phone screen image) or "capture".
Wildness has taken on a generation of video games when they were younger and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
Washington Post recently reported on Apple Watch's Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the launch of the game that 30 minutes a day suddenly increased from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on physical activity.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
That is how it achieves three basic health - support factors — exercise, fresh air and the sun and joy.
It's even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, those in this phenomenon also resent the funniest.
And yes, while playing, someone can walk towards the door.
What about it?
The breakthrough is complete.
Because while smart phones such as Fitbit could already monitor your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to start, as Pokémon Go does.
The new attraction disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, with Pokémon's success, there will be more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and health of people going on a hunt.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnasium multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
No trouble at the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday and grew the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
The US Simone Biles performs on the boom at the multiple-match final of the women's gymnasium competition on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the summer Olympic Games in Rio 2016.
The party became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time who won the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his total final score became visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport into completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to his kind for the past three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, 10 gold medals, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one last race, which was between Balaam and himself and the burden of overly high expectations, not so much between Balaam and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
After winning gold and silver, Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States will hug women in the multi-match finals of the women's gymnasium competition on Thursday at Rio de Janeiro, the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.
Billes won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for Martha Karolyi's farewell party, who coordinated the national team on top of the i.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a series of volts known as his card card – is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Since his grandparents were young and found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure. Boorman found her while she was on a daycare tour in the gymnasium where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina was able to make a small lead with two threads, it was like mirage.
And then there was the boom and the permanto, where Biles is the defending champion of the world.
He regained leadership with 15.433 points in the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points in perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for the final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue crimping color of Balaam when his dream, once written in his scrapbook, came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch to the competition four years ago when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-run.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the "Grandma" of the team was clearly ahead of the Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program, and thus rose from defeat to victory, which at times seemed uncertain.
As far as Balaam is concerned, the wide-spread tweeting made earlier in the week by this 19-year-old now has a whole new meaning:
The police report that three of them were listening to music in the car as victims of a serial killer.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, and the victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police bulletin published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, a car parked on 12 June was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, says the release.
Police suspect that the triple homicide was not a robbery because the attacker didn't take the purses and the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says that the police are now investigating whether the murder is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Latin - American settlements within four months.
"It is common for events to occur in residential areas outside the homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS CBS earlier this month.
Suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the trio had often sat in a car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a press release stating that the gun was fired on an empty pickup truck only half an hour before the triple homicide, and that the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a six-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephalus, or birthright, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, who was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get through this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund didn't get up and start crawling until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is introducing Edmund's invention of a sign that means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language; it also includes signs that Edmund himself invented.
Microcephaly may have a variety of underlying diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy such as measles or zikavirus.
There's a lot of variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how this affects the lives of those affected by Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "What's gonna happen to us,
What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope - inspiring advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississipi flooded their banks and spread to a large area as a result of heavy rains.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, reports that the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, the Tangipaho County alone has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a bulletin from the Weather Service, additional 76–127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend near the Comite River Baton Rouge and near the Amite River Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that the floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in Southwest-Mississipi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were earlier on Friday near Glolomir among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water was coming with a constant pitch," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family all have injuries, and he is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had saved all three of them in a large army - style truck and had taken them to the fire station in Glolomir, where they sheltered on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was heavily wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
Authorities report that the heavy rains and the flooding of the streets forced the residents of Tangipahoa County to be rescued from their homes, and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipahoa had told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, that there were 200 homes under flooding.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
Robby Miller, district director, reports that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
There are shelters for the evacuations in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to a flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and their businesses.
"For the last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat along the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, rescue director at Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported under flooding, but so far no news had been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store, says that he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets in his body, survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old who has been shot this week in the city.
The child's grandparents told me that on CBS Philadelphia the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the television company that they think he's gonna make it.
He was starting his first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of a car near a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shell casings from various types of assault weapon.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," said Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old in town this week was a girl with a stray bullet in her hand as she played outside her home on Tuesday in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the women's gymnasium Olympic team, and there is more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been in every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in position 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterly gymnasts.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth in a row American to win gold in the women's individual contest in a multimatch.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the species, but it does not look the same in scaffolding classes all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks that Aly and Madison followed to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five") because the next stage gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnasts are an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnasts that are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
Most of the gymnasium gymnasium facilities are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of teline gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and this means an expensive and long - term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Coach Aimee Boorman and Coach Maggie Haney of Laurie Hernandez of Simone Party have both trained sports enthusiasts since they started gymnast.
We need to provide a cheaper and more accessible training in gymnasium for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnasium 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have provided a free or affordable opportunity to exercise for more than 15 000 young townspeople (mostly black and Latin Americans) and some of these young people have achieved national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality scaffolding to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Teline gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits for the whole life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has been inspired by thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnasts, and that is absolutely amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold and for motivate so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into being prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over remuneration and changes in working conditions by adopting a revised agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, announced plans to force the agreement and said that the UK public health system (NHS) was "no one's country" and that any further delay was harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will enter into a new agreement, which will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in anti-social times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Junior Doctors, made a statement last night, saying: "Junior doctors continue to be very reserved of the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new treaty, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to engage in discussions and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
I did, despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The last strike at the end of April delayed almost 13 000 routine procedures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to bring the dispute over changes to an end by concluding a renewed agreement with British doctors' union staff.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to take any further strikes.
Mortimer says: "Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at extreme borders and cause concern, distress and disturbance to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Junior Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
The workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that pays about €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive a €2.40 medicine a day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
It is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of the UK public health system (NHS) has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of the UK public health system (NHS) has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people have a heart attack each year, one quarter of whom have a relapse or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot comes off, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is greater in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
Today's draft NICE guideline recommends that ticagrelor be administered for next 90 mg for 12 months and then reduced to 60 mg twice daily plus aspirin for another three years.
Carole Longson, professor at NICE, says: "Even though effective treatments to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, as many as a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new attack or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in relation to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Because of the climate of political correctness, electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled from office last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals the government's report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud 'in the face of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
According to Pickles, a former Minister for Regional Development and a powerful force against corruption today, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to set up guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present identity documents in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter should simply state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be dipped in unexploited ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He called for better access for journalists to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working parties.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and a culture that favours them more widely within local administrations," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman ‘stupidly distorted' the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as the basis of his campaign the religious obligation of every religious Muslim to vote for him".
Of the votes, up to 300 had been called into question or fraudulently given in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was obtained throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the fraud in the postal elections, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressuring people to vote for their elected candidate.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including the ban on the handling of postal ballots by political activists, in order to prevent 'the harvesting of votes'.
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present identity cards before voting.
Baptism of the fingers into indelibly ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of dealing with filled-in votes and letter envelopes from political activists.
The police have the right to set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person at a time can enter the voting booth.
Sir Eric is severely critical of the London police and finds it "unsurprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient "ticking checks" of the city council's electoral lists.
"The decision of the court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by worrying and covert electoral fraud by some people and its denial."
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and the other doppelgangers go wild at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went wild this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: United States men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on the bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be the favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the United States men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter after pictures of him, where he strikingly resembled the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard since childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance that big, except maybe the beard and the mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were excited about the resemblance, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these games.
Great-eyed Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the beaches, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known as Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "athletic version" of the Actor of Inception.
Similarly, for a long time the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist of swimming, the Russian Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCord, not just because of her beautifully tan skin and blond hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian, according to his fans, is the "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their face shape and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted that others saw the resemblance.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for a couple's resemblance.
A tweeter recently expressed his satisfaction when "others on the Internet also agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series are strikingly reminiscent of each other in their face and eyes.
Many have also seen the resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the broad smiles of Gabrielle Union, Gabby Douglas and Anna, the gold-winning gymnast.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis, instead of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth, in the women's 4 x 200-metre free-dimension message, shocked CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "dead as pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he began to give his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter free-dipping final.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's reporting team, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim in China.
The viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who was swimming in the finals of the women's 4 x 200-metre free swim message, was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with violent comments by Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Scott Russel, who hosted CBC's broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's remarks: "We apologize for the comment on the swim performance.
This was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC finally had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they made it to the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify what he said by saying he didn't mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
It goes without saying that I did not mean anything degrading by what I said, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, uninhibited undergarments in the middle of the store, the woman who tried on them upset customers.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on her underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four pairs of underpants at the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping center, where the woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the same time at the store, reports that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
A woman stood in the middle of a store, took her underpants off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants, and put them on.
Instead of trying to do so discreetly, he did so with complete shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took the underwear he was trying out of his leg, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three more times before finally deciding that he didn't like any of them, dressed himself and walked out.
She didn't seem to care about the looks — nor did she think about the person who would eventually buy the panties she had been trying to get."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking home underpants that someone else has worn and that they have not been washed."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the shop staff were trying to remove these items from the sale after the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without them being washed afterwards," adds Davidson.
Mr Primark's spokesman commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation that took place on Tuesday 9 August in the Folkestone movement.
All the products concerned have been removed from the sale.'
That's how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, and asked how to cope with a robber or abuser that was within range of the gun.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the firing line," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker in the knee to the groin, and when he goes out of pain double, slap him in the face with the barrel of a gun and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker with a fist into the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video. See how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash – unless you are the Krav Maga Grand Master.
World Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and cakomist reflexes to the hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guides writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handrails on Piccadilly Circus, train bathroom flush button and Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright – on the trail of inner power, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the toilet button on the train may be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are found in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals on the strengthening of good intestinal bacteria and on their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused nothing more than a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
licking rail station handrails and toilet flush button no doubt challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "From childhood I've been rather carefree about my health and put all kinds of stuff in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really proved himself worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a dirty public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border was met in a Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when a luminometer measured 4,000 units — in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures with Valio in a documentary Ian Wright – On the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright – Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
In Valio Wright was given the presence of Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance in the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we came to the idea of asking Ia to come."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian bathroom, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 per cent reported using at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
Before they were evicted, the disturbance family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The disturbance family left behind the damage of £50,000 to a town-owned rental house after they were evicted because of the terror in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from Cornwall's apartment in Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the dwelling, the representatives of the rental housing company said that the apartment was in a state of renovation.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on the floors and walls had been stained with graffiti.
The couple has now moved and are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, nobody should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh, as the property is likely to become known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and transmission, and loud shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an anti-social code.
There were several rooms in the house under the threat of demolition where old waste was found.
In the past, drugs had been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said that the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Department evicted a couple by coercive means this week after giving them 11 more weeks to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction — they said that their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, for the conduct was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and courageously offered to inform us.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their 20 ' s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after eviction.
Housing workers now have to clean out the piles of garbage around the house.
The police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis and also scales and other items and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told that they have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they demand eviction for tenants who violate the rules of the leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say that this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they wish without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beached army jet frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed at a staggering low altitude.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicking when a low - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes near contact with tourists taking sun on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose to their feet with understandable concern about the roar of jet engines that began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the people who photographed the dramatic past flight and the videos on social media were Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low level, and there was a moment when it seemed as if it were going down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shores of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a strikingly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Force this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exiting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
In January-June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) produced EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
Exit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was granted in all operations.
Exote will try to reduce the number of queues this year.
Exit covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The excess is perhaps used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Exote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers took a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Border and Coast Guard Training Corps was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Ranger Course whale event was held in the military sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special frontier medicine.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated a RTA unit, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible outwards.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a Sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different types of investigations for the rest of the police.
In Häme it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
the most recent reform of working methods;
The creation of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would not leave the scene until they were alerted.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police work is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Crime Police is the national leader.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard as their name suggests.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department's territory.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of your own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the primary police.
By means of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, prolific crimes or similar crimes.
This is called a series and is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the pattern of the act, the unsub forms a certain image.
Complicating can be done either on the basis of the way you do it or on the basis of the person you do it, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of personal and criminal methods, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will state these methods publicly if they anticipate a threat.
For example, this case was reported in early summer, a method of marking vacant dwellings used in home burglaries.
It was the people who put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment that they tried to see if the residents were really travelling.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the minutes of the District Court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen of the Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuumela of the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical action.
This is due to a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National co-operation collects information from outside the boundaries of Finland and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Tasname Akunjee, a lawyer, reports that the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike against Raqqa, which is the ISIS base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will so that people will understand that this is a real risk when entering a war zone - and that it will cause people to give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana joined two other East London schoolgirls on a plane to Turkey and took a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and had been widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Senator Harry Reid says he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court judge if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have not agreed to strengthen Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the post of Judge Anton Scalia of the late Supreme Court.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland with "unquestionably".
Reid's publicist later pointed out that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton as to whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "swirl the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Reid says that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are the presidential candidate Donald Trump's "spouses" and "advisors".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to both women and men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemer and brings to the market a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s style for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find next generation top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of treats, told us earlier this year that his naked magazine differs from the old school Playboys, as he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, as men can, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures that praise the female body without effort," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who wish to use the calendar as a model can send their photos online or attend open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write in the commentary section your angry objection under the title "Not All LonelyMen of Middle Ages", this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov's research company, the new appearance of much-spoken vinyl discs is not behind the Millenial generation's boom when the Millenials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is middle-life nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of enthusiasts to keep records, but the importance is emotional: older buyers of vinyl discs are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the lively Soho Street, wearing a gray suit with no jewelry. I'd make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperbase have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I reach out very close to the men visiting these shops and try to evaluate their age and character.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (as customers at that time two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reccless Records (as customers at that time eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends their extra time getting acquainted with the supply of shops.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 albums."
These plates fill his living room wall as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income; he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared and buy again things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people who have been affected by media hopping, who have heard about vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of the vinyl wake-up boom of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds you realize in a movement such as Phonica that they provide a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset about the non-contact payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world, for returning to familiar disc cases means permanence and remind of the happy days of youth.
"I think that sometimes it fills a gap or that material possessions are acquired for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I experience it myself as a collector, and I believe so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" says Wez's co-worker behind a stack of records.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
A poll also reported that 41 percent have a record player that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl plate buyers have no record player of their own.
At this point in the newscast, I'd probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates also involves the "poecal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, who is currently a member of the Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they still exist.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fop, where I come next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
There are 70-year-old couples, photos-taking tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is a delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz rocking the speakers, Wild Beasts' latest sex-stabbing synthesizer pop.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He's looking rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the most wonderful thing about it is..." he lets go of a lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain. They're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping around in jeans shorts, but who, instead, gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main plates for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior element and part so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure art vinyl.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group, which is most likely to have more time and money than most, also has the group that spends most money on luxuries, such as vinyl discs.
Although my research suggests that youGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans who actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work.
I'm sure they won't spend their Thursday mornings groping around the record stores on Berwick Street, browsing through the records and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a TV runner who stares scaryly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrate on earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice shark was between 272 and 512 years in the study, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of the jungle camp.
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
The Calais authorities made claims this week that the state should be allowed to break up 72 temporary shops established in a refugee camp. The shops sell different kinds of goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. In temporary restaurants you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais Prefects Authority, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and are exposed to fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals provided by a government-supported organisation and other bodies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect to be ‘fully understandable'.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the grocery stores, cafés and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than simply providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says that they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places at risk of unloading was the Jungle Book Kids Café, which is a non-profit-making café offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition requiring children's cafés to be maintained.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record-breaking, more than 9,000 lives.
Food prices are falling clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food prices in Finland fall sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food has fallen in Finland by nearly 5% in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland among the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices reached a level close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn of events, after which food has become cheaper each year.
The price is now weighed by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT should be reduced to half the EU average and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at VAT rates are indicative.
School's not quite what it used to be.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of illustrious is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education begins on four.
However, the main change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known as ice sharks, but does not reach maturity until 150 years of age.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting on a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in today's world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, according to follow - ups, only about one centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen examined.
He defined the age - old 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetres, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 salesmen are not deducted.
Almost 300 employees are made redundant from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his release.
According to this, the number of sellers in the department stores will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations involved approximately 3 000 employees.
By the time they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to save EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the grocery trade still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", Veijalainen says in the release.
The second quarter result improvement was especially due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain reached its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating profit for the whole Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the most rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday," says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but southward it will be pouty.
The temperature is not very summery any more, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was a national athlete in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officers came to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," said Kip Vähte, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, who thundered at Reuters news agency.
The Olympic athletics start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich was ranked fourth on his way to the World Cup last year and has a number of Rio winners in advance.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source explained.
Where is everybody?
Rio Sports Stadium rubbers out of nowhere
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was started over the medals of athletics, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
The Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day's morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was another one in London, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of audience at the Rio Olympic Games has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hope, Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000 people were in the audience.
The bad deal is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian tourist race, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the campaign organiser's spokesman, said this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," Andrada said according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to more than a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympic Games, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private, business and entities may use money to redeem holders' rights in the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of residence against payment.
In practice, the holder will be entitled to veto a block of 187 squares, which means that not every holder will be required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
The holder's rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect the environment," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The holder of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The website of the Foundation shows the names of the holders of the rights in the map where the parcels of the land can be found.
Leviathan sees its acquisition of nature as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is founded as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The foundation of the Helsinki Foundation's Elvest project is the protection of nature areas so that they can remain intact and undisturbed.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans land acquisition in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey the biggest cities in Finland.
This year more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained on the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts occurred per 1,000 inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were only reported about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"There are double thefts in other cities relative to the population," says police inspector Tommi Reen.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Ikäs.
Tommi Reen of the police department is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to which cities are studying and cycling.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In the January to August period, slightly fewer bike thefts have come to the attention of the police in all of Finland than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and approximately 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're huge amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report the theft of a bike, even if fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"You can also find cases in other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, inner yards, warehouses and wheel cellars, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not known that stolen bikes are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if the good-quality bike is sold at a price that is clearly below the price," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says the Moose. "No one has ever been taken, a good monk has done so."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, this doesn't necessarily have hipster value," says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike pecked the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, which alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Most of all, bad spins, such snoty Jokos."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valvee himself from the courtyard of the housing company.
Although the bike had not been locked, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
You're under 15 years old and you're responsible for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury members familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of conciliation that are used side by side.
"Every young person's actions are directed in a more responsible direction, so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflects what happened with people about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path you have chosen," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported in the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetentness and record displeasure threaten to bring a landslide to the democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only direct targeting of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-corsed anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States.
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported on the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to become president so that the economy can do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a hand-to-hand hand for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We're a builder's people, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that rich people should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States to become a tax refugee, it will have to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"I, as President, am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the financial programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "prefering only to millionaires of this kind".
The reduction proposed by Trump in corporate taxes has previously been called "Trump's loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are the ratings of Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually sports competitions are shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached a great number of spectators.
At one point the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: at the same time 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 followed the swimming on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago received almost 800 000 admissions to TV2, and the European Football Championships received well over a million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports have so far been the Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, which both reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, the chief sportsman, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
Even on television, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers throughout that period, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's competition broadcasts come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which in the first days of the Games rose to the Apple App Store as the freeest download application in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the ratings for the network until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena hasn't worked as well as we'd hoped.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
We have updated versions of the apps that should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympic Games are more visible on Yle's channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can track some of the sports on Yle Fem, and on radio Yle Speech transmits the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 meters on the Rispinsel.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found about 20 square meters of pressure on the Risselkä, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters," says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi are over 80 metres long.
They haven't been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There might well be some unknown deeps," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of a central depth, it is Great Lake Yuka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne is unable to reach the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
A fan of the tax discount: Pensioners are still more heavily taxed
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the irregularity was raised under parliamentary elections and that the tax on pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises given should be followed after the elections," he says to the media in the West.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in Parliament by opposition representatives who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is protected, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Mr Petteri Orpo, on tax reductions is mainly about safeguarding and not increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the reign.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be destroyed by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in a row
He calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop it from growing.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will disappear.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no reports of Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people died during the bombings of Finnish time.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but you should follow the embassy's instructions on caution," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel period to Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says we haven't heard from whoever did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that these events may be linked to the political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is smoldering, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok," Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to have an impact on the day's course, with the authorities being extremely careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, which are popular among tourists.
In a tourist destination favored by Finns, there were four bombs in Phuket Island last night, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death.
Two bombs blew up in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
We don't know who did the attacks.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more, he said to the journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks took place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Great Envoy about caution," Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and about the victims.
There's been a little bit more information about the attack last night at Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A local employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half hour or so.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four-game.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second score of 60.098, and Alija Mustafina of Russia was the third score of 58.665.
Partyes, 18, is still in the Rio World Championships for stand championships with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has had a lot of control over women's gymnastics in recent years.
He had eight personal world championships from the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permano championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, Party has achieved two championships in the team race.
You know, the party's got a lot of jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huevila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, says Huuvila, who has worked for some 20 years as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the avian flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
The office of the Huvila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The guard heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around nine o'clock at the local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The Huvila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday," Huvila says, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the day, traffic at Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huevila who visited the site.
Later, this car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the use of a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, the highest-ranking leadership change was made in Russia in years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He's a former diplomat. He's the number two in Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason why Ivanov was fired could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from building up too much power.
He adds that recycling management functions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from collecting power independent of the President for themselves.
According to the fabric stream, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Dropping station in Ivanovi
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin called the transformation into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested a transfer and proposed that Persecution replace him," Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era at the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnönniemi of the Finnish Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to Syria Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected at 7:30: Previously, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the Minister of the Interior's events.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounting file.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified a need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under the ranks.
In the early days, he insulted his back thighs and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic exams.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the fact that a Jamaican star has risen in an era where athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest is underlined.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres period 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, with which he crushed the world record and the self - confidence of his competitors despite the final celebrations of 9,69 C.E.
This is gonna be harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
The world record of 9.58 100 metres and 19.19 200 metres in Berlin still stands.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a world record of 200 metres and a low 19 seconds, but no one believes in its birth except Bolt himself.
With 100 Bolt's greatest challenge is the Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prestigious championships if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011 the $100 World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in more than a week.
He's an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of drug abuse.
In addition, a Kenian athletic coach was sent to his home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a doping sample with signs of ep-hormone.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his case of doping to the CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sport.
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other suspicions of doping in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female estranger Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of ep hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a drug abuse.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that a Kenian coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to the media records, this is John Anzrah, a Kenyan speed coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 - meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping Phelps. Historic gold came in the show style.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-metre mixture in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an evening magazine quick interview.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or in the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels shoes and a short dress with at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to startle you and perhaps even startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio Police made two arrests on suspicion of terror.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons prior to their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The arrests are believed to have ties to the Isis organization.
The arresters had reportedly fuelled violence in social media.
Among other things, the popular WhatsApp service had been used to disseminate messages that called for violence.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their pre-group fight at the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled blasting mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the beginning of the fight because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the crowd into the hangar after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had entered the race in a sleepy state.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria by 96-87.
In the last two games Spain reached silver.
This is the third time the police have carried out a controlled blasting mission during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time I saw the police, they had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road biking goal last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-string Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pummeled Petaja-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a rough time on Thursday.
Argentinian dame beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because under the Olympic rules it would have been pointless.
I should have dropped in the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
With the crash, the Finn was left in 27th place.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The car accident didn't have much effect.
Friday is a big day when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are customs that directly or indirectly affect a person's health in such a way that his or her life is prolonged.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include the tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don't even have to spend all the time getting a can of milk.
Many studies have been carried out to find out the secret of a long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Harvard University's study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, studies in favour of alcohol suggest that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
In contrast, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway examined how laughing affected a person's life span.
Over 54,000 people were monitored by a seven-year project.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the test ended.
According to many studies, sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for your health.
In addition, it can also extend your age.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he or she should also have an orgasm.
The exercise will, of course, bring additional years. There will be no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute levity.
In fact, an Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got into medals at the Olympics, he's more likely to live longer than a regular pigeon.
A lot of research has been trying to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 found that the person who shopped daily was likely to be older than the person who shopped less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may result in early death.
So put down your credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver in a drunk-in-the-hours accident went off into a truck.
On Friday night a serious accident involving a lorry and a passenger car took place in Koskö, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskella, Koskuntien and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right angle of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it was set on fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and then passed over the ditch onto its roof.
The woman who drove the passenger car in 1972 was squeezed in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a serious DUI.
The mail sent some loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's selection of loose candy was incomplete because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy at Salo K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So if there's no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is on the Post's menu until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the upgrade struck me.
Representatives of the media have been calling all along, and the attention that this issue gives is incredible, Eltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elves got their own favorites to grab in a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who was responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti's Companies, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets wandered off to the wrong place yesterday (Sinajoki) and no longer left for part delivery (Saloon) by three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was the Evening Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Loss of weight! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost ten kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos due to a change in life.
Lotta shared a pair of pictures on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work as early as 2009.
He has made a comprehensive lifestyle change and has gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday Backlund released a pair of pictures of his incredible performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The backlund image pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from co-suppliers.
You're amazing.
You're on your way, motivation's hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
Your pictures give me a lot of strength and enthusiasm when you're on the same journey, the other tells.
In the spring Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Let's Do It Now" project.
At that time he told the Evening magazine that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos.
During a three - month exercise, five kilos were finally dropped.
The family wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not by flowers and petitions, but by a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
The publication shows that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, with a sense of humor, and not afraid of work.
My dear friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have said that the victim was very animal lover to the Evening Magazine.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post to violation of the Equality Act
The Post had no right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, assessing the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post could have withheld only a part of the trainee's salary that corresponded to the part of the full day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's Association Decision on the prohibition of introduction.
During last November's postal strike, the PAU decided not to familiarise Post employees with temporary workers who break the strike.

Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Association.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its letter earlier, the Journalist Association asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concerns in favour of freedom of expression and of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration... and replaced by a man of Estonian origin, Persecution.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergey Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
It will be the Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Mr. Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to the Kremlin's press release.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer and proposed that Persecution replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
The BBC: ManU's giant buy-in to a no-playing game is not seen at the opening of the Champion League.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen on the field when the British Champion League kicks off at the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed us to England.
The huge purchase of Manchester United, Paul Pogba, is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, told the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for Pogba to Juventus.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened with a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round of August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred in the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists is this year's punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's a little out of the ordinary for us to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to last year's 70 000 by 5,000.
The festival will also have a series of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance it.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being controlled on huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grass-dressed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15 000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The biggest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creative things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled to be particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a job in the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday night, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wildlife living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it right here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bars, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favored by the Finns.
No one's known to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new alert forces goes into battle first in a war situation
It is not until several months after the military oath is taken that military troops are ordered to fight in an acute war situation, reports the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, interviewed by the magazine, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight for example for 5.5 months of military service.
According to the Head of Training, the first priority is to appoint reserve members of the emergency teams.
None of the military or reserve personnel are ordered to perform a mission that has not received the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training the armed forces in the immediate capability units starting next year.
Units can be used for military operations when necessary, even during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensation for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was harmful to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in the condition of demolition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple's legal proceedings and settlements.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, as the purchasers had already known some need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good health.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a fit home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
In terms of risks and non-compliance, the fitness report mentioned ventilation and the lack of adequate management of the rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwater from the cliffs might have to be controlled a little over the course of a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were far more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which according to the Witnesses were due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the capillaryly raised ground humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also enter the interior via the porch.
Healthy risk, mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the housekeeping room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window isolation and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make non-authorised changes to the dwelling before the sale.
The terraces, for example, were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
Home problems, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the Court, the purchasers were able to assume from the seller before the sale that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
The purchasers have not failed to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and licenses come from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were conducted in women to investigate the matter.
The race agency investigated women's backgrounds by, among other things, studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency handwritten biographys and good recommendations from close friends.
The race agency wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "savers", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, states the museum's website.
On the sixth floor of the traitor Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko ranked third in the first race of Finnjollie's day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was left at the top of the tail of the whole group at the second race of the day.
In the overall situation he rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren took 23th place at the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who was the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork and is currently in a frenzy lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Kopinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The bridgehead's career rose to total praise when he won the crown of the tango king in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned some different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the man's request, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
Satulinna was one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know it was sung with a hangover from recording a song that got a huge hit.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost 20 years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time, and the case eventually ended up with "You Earn Gold" in texts published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmäs were not as the Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined himself making a record that told a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the news in the 7-day newspaper.
In the news of the newspaper, Jari and his ex-lover were told the reason for the divorce was Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls during the voting week predict the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign by former US president Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, the stupid" flew into a junkyard in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics will provide professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status among economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing, as it promotes the export industry.
The Economists felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, they were struck by the fairness of the BBC, which gave only a couple of percent of the economists in favour of the difference between the EU and the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hate press was not interested in explaining the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other powerful economic combinations on the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
The academics of big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit from the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for the real British children to get a place in school if they were to get rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and particularly EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish company Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result were to be left, the plan B, that is to say, the victory of the camp that supported the EU difference, began to be prepared more closely.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but could now be necessary.
We went out to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of news.
Old man says the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds," Vanhanen says of all the open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down.
When the European camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one trust after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cost you.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen Continental European Funds.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
He felt that the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures dominate about 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the end of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not look more "funky" to Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the period preceding the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's activities in the real estate market in London
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look so good.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, in charge of property investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, came back to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive in spite of this morning's night.
At the office, the television screens that were normally set to be silent were squealing the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed only red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive," says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started a correction.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The weight collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic falls in the property market in Britain and London in particular.
The London office premises were expected to have losses of up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the weed has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear to have been the last summer vacations this week in the face of Vanhanen who spent in Helsinki.
He felt it was far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will be made and how Scotland will react, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already received first-hand information.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent was accumulated, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls occurred in the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man does not think that the parable is quite right, because this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that one, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's also a financial guarantee that's normally available.
The repair shop could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, he didn't think it was a miracle that the price adjustment was going to happen without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a very high altitude.
London's prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and the population of London has also grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is globalised," says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led, for example, pension companies to seek returns on new destinations.
On this basis, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
♪ Decentralize, decentralize ♪
In London, the rise in prices evened out last summer," says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten his holdings in London and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops," Vanhanen says.
He's too afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly a shot in the ascent.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can work through the pits.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised," says Vanhanen.
The S Group will start to register shop information more closely than before
Soon the S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it is starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, once data has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to hold it on products purchased in early May.
The S Group will follow Kesko here, as information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and are used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information," says Riitala.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer programme and there is no such programme planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own One-Bonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with Valtatalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will report on this later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
At first, an experiment.
So far, SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data include occupation, education, form of residence and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method have been recorded from the S-Etour card purchase.
In addition, the information of the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
However, for S-markets, Prismos, Home Terras and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
The S-Group says they're going to inform their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data will be stored in cages anyway, whether they want it or not.
The willing person can check their stored information on the S Group website.
For example, the cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
Black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five identical boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings for the powder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tull's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main place of work because the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs tasks is mail delivery via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails per year pass through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 findings related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into all the checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research," says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more gun and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about this idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with experts from the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides which smells Heila is taught to detect.
Heila is always further trained as needed," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs as well as the cash and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from ten puppy litters.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as tranquillity because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human streams.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The cameraman of the evening Sanomat loses the microphone cover of the camera to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy cover immediately from the "move" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work vest, recalls Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70,000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active participations last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was over.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in Suva, the capital city, where the stadium had a screen set up.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging," said a journalist from the Fiji Times to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish lifter fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter, Milko Tokola, was successful with his last attempt at 175 kilos after a tough fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined score was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push at 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weight rose with the ferocious roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The Finnish lifter's joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - League of Bets - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player on our team who has power and has a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than 10 players from around the world.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative, as Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS explained in the release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinna Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemiers meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Brave Modern Family Star again: Teenager Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again flaunting by showing off her pompous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in social media pictures with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, suspected that Winter is experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost his whole life, growing up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look exposed, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the decline is already so tough," says a woman at Winter Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start northern lights in early autumn," Visit Finland says in the release.
The main destinations of the Japanese Northern Light tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the assets of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
Winter northern lights in Lapland are very much in demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision double-folded, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's main target group for the Northern Lights campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the country among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would long for clearer unique sights in Finland, and according to Lind, the Northern Lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland," says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 when Fiji's champion team won gold.
The impressive success of the seven-player rugby race in Great Britain was devastatingly broken when Fiji won it in the finals played at Rio's Deodoro Stadium on Thursday 43-7.
Fiji taught the masters how to handle the ball, move, side diversions, support game, running lines and brutal force, thus winning gold — if the country had the first Olympic medal in all its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little bit more comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic Games, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard victory over the South African Boxes in 7-5 semifinals earlier in the same day may have had a negative effect on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The British may find comfort in the fact that at least one British gets a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and presented her tackle skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team ran into a bunch of moving buses, and world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolisau made a dive into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the rugged Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but that did not slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of playing the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal at the right angle, after which Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for the extension, with more than a minute left for the first half of the game.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the more powerless tackles of the British team and plunged over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentice.
Which is much the case.
Great Britain made large-scale changes at half time and managed to hold off the Fijians for four whole minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the score to 36-7 by scoring a goal for Great Britain at the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Sea archipelagos whose fans sang, waved flags and danced.
Fiji's pure joyous attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring a goal at the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day Fiji had won Japan's semifinals in 20–5 and Great Britain had simmered past South Africa in a tight semifinal, where the balance was solved by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and plunged under the goalposts at the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-player rugby team, Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is as emotional as gold could be in these games.
On the first bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 triumphant bets on history and found additional meaning for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two oars, the third voice of coach Robin Williams echoed in the boat, encouraging them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sport who achieved a similar achievement.
Their superiority was unquestionable, their victory was already 39rd in a row and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface of water like swans of age, does not fully reflect the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helpful hands, each of which has contributed to the achievement of the two. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and then did not know if he would see today.
According to Williams, the situation at the time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
If it wasn't for surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little the way you think."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonal season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say so under such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps are enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
The British Royal Artillery Regiment Captain Stanning, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen's and Robin's cashiers have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thanks to her, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark were approaching, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We didn't seek the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good rowing and win the race we did."
The two will think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the nature shows on television.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland's changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protestors who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks are calling for already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians used tax havens to circumvent taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised at that time to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn elections.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear sense of criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tumults.
He said that he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink down that low as commander in the army, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini bathing suits on bathing areas, which are popular with Muslims, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are large-scale religious affiliations, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremists linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Lake Pyykkösjärvi blue seaweed
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Blueweed precipitation has been observed at the shore of Lake Toykös.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu Region and 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the shores of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci in the marine pool were confirmed on Wednesday when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limit.
The sea of Toykösjärvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a seaweed flower, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water in the form of rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through more frequent inspections.
In the event of a blue seaweed bloom becoming a blue seaweed flower, the bathing area's information board will also be a separate information sheet.

MTK's Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational conversion of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one," says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticisms in the tax change proposal.
Forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income less all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal starts with a reduction in the pure capital income of forestry, which prevents it from leading to a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it," Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said that the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The threshold for tax deduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000.
It's too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been taking after Hakkarainen for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailer surprised the drivers at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and ran into each other.
A special chase took place on Friday morning at the Kalajoki Himanga.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars in a row derailed into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the driver's tail.
According to Harri Pyhtä, the on-call firefighter, the ditching is suspected of being caused by intense hailing.
In the car behind, there were two persons who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the vehicle that was driving ahead was not injured.
The accident took place on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments that are more effective than before.
The findings of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's study team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer treatment may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the research were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos's family home killing continues at court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another person.
Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both convicted.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
One received eight years for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of one of them is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without entitlement as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a lesser sentence for a young person's murder to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as a child welfare supervisor at a schoolhouse in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go and led the youngster to his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum pipe.
Among other things, the director was strangled with a lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from the family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, only growing at 156 years of age
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
To add to the life span of the ice shark, it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Investigators found out how old they were by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
They allowed scientists to estimate the age of sharks.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of the total tax revenue of the state would not be received if the change in corporate tax that Donald Trump was promoting was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, particularly as a result of tax incentives that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6%, after a discount from Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the economy and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste need to be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector needs to be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint 'experts instead of bureaucrats' in the administration.
According to Trump, 'suffering' trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45 - percent penalty tax and from Mexico 35 - percent penalty tax.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme take the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is frantic, but the real tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street chatter - accounting with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun and fun satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of my Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It's a conventional serene love, relationship and family drama centered on a mother-daughter relationship.
It's a simple story and we'll see a lot of it as a long flashback.
Life seems to be good for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's young teacher Adraina Ugarte, a TV acquaintance from the series Time between stitchings (2013-2014), comes to the second leading woman.
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be viewed as a slob, but I would say that time is time-swipe.
The Almodóvar films often have a fair distance from such a characteristic flashyness to the humor of Julieta.
It is a flatly played, subdued, place with good music in some places and a rather sad film that has the ingredients for elephantism.
Instead, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is still in place and so that it gradually begins to stick its eye in a pure form rather than as a working dramatic power.
People in the film are affected by illness, death or otherwise by sudden loss, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is particularly true of dress: in the case of a name person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, i.e. the tunes of the respective scene, is not getting any better.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has produced the manuscript on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro of Canada, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novellit has been published in Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat evenly written literary filming.
Emotionally, the ingredients would have been infinitely more dramatic drama, so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the film's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
lead: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are going to be done a lot.
There won't be any new surgery.
The four billion that have already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the SM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework group.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
♪ Municipal elections haunt you ♪
Why are ministers so emphatic about the fact that no new cuts are made on these?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
Gallup reports, however, that the government party is waiting for the Finns to lose their snorts, even though the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
The base Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, of which the price of influence in the right-wing government will be realised for a large part next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the ability of the Finns to stand up.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government politics in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also come to the surface.
First of all, the new cuts are not going to happen. First of all, the fact that next year they are going to be done violently and the second is going to try to soften the waiting attack on the Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take €5.9 billion in debt next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hand in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring Parliamentary elections will accept what comes next.
These measures do not allow indebtedness to be reduced
It is quite clear that the current measures do not break down debt, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäe at the press conference prove this irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly risen since the collapse of 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will reach 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost about EUR 6 billion to maintain unemployment, which will be virtually fully covered by new debt.
This is the understanding of the city centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of Finland of what is responsible.
Survey: Many tasks are left to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation's research.
A clear majority of the population also takes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building control, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled are most clearly the responsibility of the region.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be delegated to the State.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantstie on Friday night at half past six.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorbike without lights, but a young man went to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to the Sonakajanranta road, from which the road continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
Nor did he have a driving licence that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch in Lake Polvi on the Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The emergency services lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the personnel and paramedics of the rescue helicopter.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil poured into the road from the crashed truck that was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the river Ilma
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahtinkylä in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a tall, thin, well - rounded woman with white hair under her jaw.
Observations and tips on lost movements are asked to call the hotline 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The fall current that knocked down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Society of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed in the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow rate is generated in a thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling airflow.
Changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools down and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the slipstreams.
The crash flow hit Parafest in the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 persons in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries to further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed the most toxic particles in London and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
Cutaneous particulates are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which almost 9 500 Londoners die of according to Evening Standard each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their business trips near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by means of various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed, pushing the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor did have enough time to push the man to the central hospital with serious injury to the further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further because it hit the rocks in the front.
Resurrection to the coming season
The League-Riento, a member of the League of Rivers playing in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series in October from a better starting point than from memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common note can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach of Rienno, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
In the foreign trio, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, 23 years old, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwandan national team, is a five-inch chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a length of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all the world championships in the gym band since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at the North American tryouts.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a national team for the gym band.
I got interested, and here we are, Kempänen, 48, says.
Gympanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Kempänen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, no such sport was played at the SM level as the gym bandy.
They played the ball at the university.
I played basketball at Kataja and later at the River Boys in the SM series, Kempänen remembers.
Gympanen played the gym band SM series for the 1991-92 season with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club to the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, the balance in 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoinen-based Tatu Väänänen, a Joensuu-based gym bandy club, was elected to the Finnish national team that will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen, Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh problem and is a member of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
The national team also named Mika Kohonen, a former player of the brothers in Seinäjoki, who was last seen in Finland's shirt at last December's World Cup.
Petri Kettunen, from Kontiolahti, is the head coach of the Salibandy National Team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach Volley will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
During three days, the medals are played in a series of adults and young people alike.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of the rankings of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been at the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can make it to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals in the neighborhood," Hasu feels.
Kouvola's neighborhood lit Hasu's spark in sports and gave a good lunch for a great hobby.
You know, there's a lot of memories of being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old at Elimäki's YMCA E-girls.
The top part is the oversized jersey, the knee pads on the ankles and the amazing aces and choreographies after the point," says Hasu.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the Society's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of species during junior years to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
The beach of Kärälammi has been playing songs since the 1990s.
The activities of visitors have always been active.
I also went on my own to watch the junior SM tour sectionals, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Annina Parkkinen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still don't have the SM gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toe slippers are on the nail, Hasu is planning.
The crash flow knocked over tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, the disaster was near

Solomon's Koli courageously set out as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon's Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas too.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his little brother Valtteri Koli, began acting as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking out debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on the farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was very brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have the faith to produce pure Finnish food and that things would turn out well.
Solomon's Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has produced results, as Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until August 21st.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen to more than zero since October last year when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2 per cent.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared with December 2015 per cent) has been –0.2 per cent, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared with July 2015 was –0.2 per cent.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices of the following categories of consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unpretentious tools that distort characteristics, creating more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps are quickly made public.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it provided some of its users this week with a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted teeth and made the cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
Critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions point to the greater problem that the company has with its differences.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and it was written, among other things, by The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told us that he had removed the filter.
The company explained this: the lens was intended as a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly denied the anime metaphor.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed from the pictures, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is associated with the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yeslowface", but one that has been taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
The general public of Snapchat consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts, which may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things of this kind will no longer be so easily overlooked as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu during an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Designer in the Medium release platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his medium article and telephone interview, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company's management, mostly white and exclusively male, and ended his writings with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff who can make decisions like this, or that they also have colored employees, but their position is not such as to dare to express their opinion directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, claiming its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its publicist, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For their part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not okay."
According to the Congressional Group of Experts, military officials distorted intelligence on ISIS
The Congressional Expert Group published a report on Thursday that officials from the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, amended intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events in the field gave cause to understand.
The Republican presidents of the Sub-Committee on Intelligence and Defence Resources of the House of Representatives Committee (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to report on the "general discontent" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, in charge of military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the United States' counter-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed and were, without exception, more positive than those of other intelligence units," explains the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, California's Republican representative.
"The errors of Centcom's management range to the highest level of the organization."
A 10-page report details the continuing problems of Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by Obama's administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives the impression of analysts that Centcom's leaders had put pressure on them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than what actually happened," says the report.
‘For example, an official of Centcom made a public statement that a large military assault on the return of Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015.'
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of ISIS.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo, a member of the Kansas Republican Party.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the United States Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned of the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the Committee for Parliamentary Intelligence published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process of evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraq's security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democrat representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "retarded the publication of intelligence results, "injured the morale of analysts" and "insufficient attention to divergent views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions to the 'pre-defined or political official line'.
News site Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional study on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon's chief inspectorate, which was initiated following actions by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his announcement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is under way.
However, he says: "Sometimes experts disagree with the interpretation of complex data and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions in addition to trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the arguments made last year called into question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of intelligence on ISIS is in line with the disagreements that arose over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study showing that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the protests of many analysts, only supported small troops in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence on ISIS.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at the refineries controlled by ISIS had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built ad hoc refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside Central Command, reported The Times in September.
The Centcom commander at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as commander of the Central Command.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's field hockey and establish its position in a confrontation with Britain
After three goals in a winning 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team on Thursday when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of their goals."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and in their group share the first place with Britain, who continued his winning streak when on Thursday they won Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Each team survived the final, which determines which of them will be the first and which of the six teams will be the second.
First placer avoids a longer encounter with the hard-core Dutch team who won the second block.
Despite what happens on Saturday's game, the Americans have already made a fuss about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was left last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the field hockey bat for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel). He made it to the national team at 16 and was thus the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympic Games when he failed to make it to the final list of players.
After this came the 2012 competitions, where he and his team did not see much success.
The following year Craig Parnham of England was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've turned around."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal at the first half by hitting the ball near the back with a knuckle.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained the 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, squirming into the middle field, hitting the ball to the finish line, and thus taking the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of episode four.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal was sunk in each one hit.
Briggs is now living in a successful season.
So did Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic Hull, the trampoline brings zens
No matter where you go, no matter how long you go, you're bound to run into the Olympics.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as an intense message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton, passing from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafeteria queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics, will smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in a good mood TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley of Lake Forest, California, 28, competes for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
Olympic fire does not illustrate all competitions on an equal footing.
Far from the center, partly in the shade are less known sports such as aerial gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast swim, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may be permitted to write a modest article about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the subdued appeal of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the Sydney Games in 2000, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Although athletes from the United States have taken part in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never been able to win medals or go to finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and the women's side of the medal prize has been grabbed by Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
But there's an underdog's charm in the trampoline, partly because of the uncivilised ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this connection that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comical potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jumps, i.e. species that are essentially combined in trampolines.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "boomboard".
Ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the title of trampoline gymnastics, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When seeking gold, medallions need to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reports, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical — and it is enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find this a little exhausting just to watch the games.
This is where the trampoline gives you a breather.
In the trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and bounces back up effortlessly.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it has nothing to do with a frantic rush to the goal or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen as an Olympic race can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will be held Friday afternoon and will begin at 1 p.m. local time and men's match on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will begin on each day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the midst of Olympiamania, there is a calm and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of a general tumult.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and by objectifying them — as recently suggested by American male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is waiting for his breathing new group of fans.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dismantled demonstrations demanding political change throughout Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
According to witnesses, several unarmed protestors were shot and killed by police.
The videos of the demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security forces beat young people with sticks who have been forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The military and intelligence services of the United States strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia; few African countries, if any, will receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, even a new urban train in Addis Ababa.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, is still a long way from a model country for democracy: human rights organisations have consistently reported on the repressive policy of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are smothered and have no choice but to show their minds, it will burst out," says Seyom Teshome, a university lecturer at Central Ethiopia.
"All the young people are showing their minds.
A whole generation protests."
There are many reasons for discontent, always from land use to the stranglehold of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections of last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result they are now ruling the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the worsening situation in June claimed hundreds of lives.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood, which has been lurking under the surface for years, is breaking out right now.
The first is apparently innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people get access to the Internet through proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oros and the Amhars.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharas, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and Oromen feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population, yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said that he was particularly good at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who compromised the relations between the opposing parties.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says Abdi, conflict investigator.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' boots with almost no knowledge.
Unlike Meles, from the region of Tigre of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces under the command of the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first screwed up and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And a grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in Amhar city Gondar, protestors attacked Tigre owned companies, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a state of distress.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drones watching Somalia as a neighbouring country, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to draw back his words in the latest dispute over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to justify their candidate in these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at the election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump made a complete twist on the tweet about the previous day when he said that he had been completely serious about his accusations during several interviews.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off.
The most recent review storm arose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the support numbers went down.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretchs the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how supporters react to messages, and then "solves" depending on reactions," says Ruth Sherman, communications expert, who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more pungent as his support numbers have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida is in a tight, even-handed position.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
However, having been subject to ever more detailed scrutiny during the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, in which they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the presidential candidate vigorously during an interview with CNN on Thursday.
'I regard his words as a justifiable, political speech' answered Giuliani when he was asked whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was an almost unknown, small organization, which Obama completely mistakenly called a "team of the lower series" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was the Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to continue to act when it failed to deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, accusing them of snorting his speeches and of having a discriminatory attitude toward him.
He mocked the "unsuitable and pathetic" TV commentators who tried to find out about him, but he said that they could not succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Because of the excessive rent increase, the café opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a shabby café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside position on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals find this loss of a café that has been avoided under middle - classing sad.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB Club no longer exists, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, they're creating new ones.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unambitious.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café.
He started in the Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-chicken egg-cheese-sandwiches available and capers and brown onion rings available for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can't get any more beer from the café, but instead you can get juice from fresh fruit.
After nine months of keeping the café, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old regulars began to visit the Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he tells me he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also on the list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work, and he couldn't help but order the same.
"I entered the café every day at quarter past seven, like a machine, and there they already prepared my voibage with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge about the soap store taking the old place.
Soap Cherie's owners even offered to make a special soap, which is made by Verb's own cold-dried coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Traditional Poles in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place for it to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other advantages.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-fried coffee at the café.
The café may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like coming home," says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
Ugly food of the Great Depression in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinaryist, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Devil's Eggs (Deviled Eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is the A Square Meal published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the big stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the editor ordered meatloaf, the couple said that it was very suitable for the discussion of eating the Great Depression.
"The tablets were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liverloaf and beansloaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts, they're enough for a whole meal."
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the major recessions, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, served on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you like".
Women cooked for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is the chronicle of how the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as meatloafs and casseroles became the main food, and the casseroles were called "a wonderful way to use the leftovers" because chefs could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the central part of an American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange mixes were tried, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even a healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced baked onions filled with peanut butter used as a food for shortage.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion do not fit at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office between 1923 and 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be specific budget holders and to meet the challenge of turning carrot-cream-pags into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood's simple food on a Iowa farm, he himself ate, such as the millionaire and sophisticated master he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the least poorly prepared."
Many of the food in the depression was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food supply and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple report that they began to understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw away the food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even began to get sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once for wind hats."
After the main plate was emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sunk our spoons into thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did it for the second time and for the third time.
"The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget holder.
Gilead's full compensation for legal fees for the patent dispute with Merck on hepatitis C medicine
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it received for the patenting of a hepatitis C medicinal product with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the success of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni medicines. The US judge found Merck to have committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court says that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it received for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of the sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead drugs.
U.S.-supported forces have taken the city of Manbij from Isis
The U.S.-supported forces have taken possession of the city of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, when the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, says the spokesman for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Group is now scouring the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages abducted by the ISIS fighters have been released.
"We are now in full control of the city, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax.
On Friday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return showing that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, formerly Secretary of State, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster publisher for his book on his term of office in the State Department.
Clinton's Vice President candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Caine and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to show a model for financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a release.
In perfect contrast, Donald Trump hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
According to the custom, US presidential candidates have always published their tax records, even though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit and call it why Trump has not released his income data.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and published a video online on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to publish their tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a provision named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters in the Berkshire Hathaway multi-purpose company is located in the same place, challenged Trump to meet with them both to disclose their tax records.
Buffet says that he has also been audited by the Tax Administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the city of Chappaqua in New York State, paid an average of 32 % of the real federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40,5 %.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109 000.

Chili powdered condoms to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Wildlife conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation — the elephants are rushed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which created the idea a few years ago, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can count on them to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed by a flashlight and a horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw out the so-called chili cloud.
The mixed chilli powder is placed in a condom together with the firecracker, followed by the end of the condom so that only the fuse is left out.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive away an elephant.
Last resort is the thrower, which shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
A Jewish film director criticized a Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from Arab "call" – RT News
A French film director from his roots, a Jewish background, gave birth to media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's territory number in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, unsettled his frustration at the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of area codes offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response upset him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinsky hotels".
The reason behind the operation further upset the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding the removal of Israel's area code."
The Israeli ambassador, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great disgrace".
"We are all shocked and shocked by this incident.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is the very chain of hotels.
That's all I need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the network, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Desperate" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given", writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest against Brazilian students.
On Thursday in Sao Paulo, the students met with the police when they gathered together to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot began when law enforcement tried to break up the student force, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration who wanted to demonstrate their dismay at government plans.
The Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has put forward a proposal for a austerity measure whereby nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls of Michel Temer, who was temporarily opposed to the post of President.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of the excommunicated President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate voted on an official charge in this regard.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the end of the sanctions, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Increasing trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
Sales of machinery, land vehicles and weapons accelerated the trade", says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries whose citizens travelled in Russia.
And it is not too risky to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have maintained the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scot Callum Skinner hit the finish line when the British won the gold of cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner drew attention to the reputation of the men's team print at the Rio velodrom last night, when the Great Britain trio defended the title that was earned in London 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow was in the role of anchor he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland. The young man made the legend proud as he rushed to the finish line and captured the victory from the favorite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished sixth in March at the London World Championships, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, the first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to end his competitive career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was the man that British coaches believed in and saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And Britain's trio won a duel of gold.
Hindes was close behind after his tour, but Kenny struggled with the team leadership that Skinner kept.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace at a higher gear, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed from his post as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eyes as they entered the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, deliberately admitted to falling on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew, and Britain's rivals had no way to complain.
This time there were no problems of this kind associated with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like London, all the British flags were flying in the audience.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympic Games feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, we are facing a successful five-day velodrom.
As Kenny has demonstrated by his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold at one Olympic Games.
This would mean the accumulation of an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
The medallions would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is for the sprint, which starts today and settles in three days.
Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team race is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get the knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in four-man team racing.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday he had an argument with the competition operators before the time run when the trustees invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record date of 4:13.26.
The British team can now be confident that its great bike team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, amidst claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on velodrom the first night show that Britain's already legendary reputation of rising to the top at the perfect moment is once again realised.
The future of the Portland smelter plant at stake as a result of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when the power company supplying electricity to the melting plant said that one of the factory's owners is dissolving the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by Victoria's government not to continue the subsidies used to keep the plant in operation.
The flat-rate 20-year grant will expire in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of cessations.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa Portland's melting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
These measures correspond to the speculations that have been going on for years about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of its production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects that the other three owners of the smelter plant will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority interests in the factory.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL indicates that the contracts are so-called hedging contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so it ends in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects the contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017", says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million "as anticipating the termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts ‘does not affect Alcoa ...'s ability to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant'.
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still has to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the melting plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and the factory in Tomago near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, operating director of AGL, said in a speech addressed to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of electricity on an annual basis.
‘If these plants leave the market, this will mean a significant decrease in demand in the (electricity) market.
As a producer, that would not be good news for us," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians real TV star Kendall as cover girl for the September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and his mother and manager Kris's fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performs at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashians style?), a handwritten video with all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar harrassers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, producer Ryan Seacrest of the Kardashians program), who had forgotten his sister's cover picture. The video ends in the classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché and is used in almost every degree program birthday session (Seacrest says: "You thought we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character of the children's morning TV), but Krisin had to involve his other daughters in this publicity in some way.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold publication in the year.
More photobooks than fashion magazines attract a large number of advertisers (a fashion site from Fashion calculated that last year's 832 page opus had 615 pages of advertisements).
The release of the September magazine's cover star is so eagerly awaited that the previous two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, celebrities working as models have been on the cover rather than models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, and a year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a successful model of his generation, and even if he were more of a model-working celebrity, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or children today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if Jenner is all about these).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared last year in the cover photo, has one of the strongest years of his career when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his reality-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "the bitches".
These feelings have flared up again when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the constant squirming of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking around in Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the commercial face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through pay-per-view applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he shot in the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he performs on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the countries are turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the impact of further cuts in appropriations on centres already operating at the extremes.
In Queensland, three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services are already being turned away from five people – the majority of them are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in the budget.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that thousands of people are already turned away from the centres each year according to the latest calculation report drawn up by the National Legal Aid Centres' National Association.
If the federal government doesn't roll over, Farrell says it's gonna get worse.
"The Queensland Public Legal Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away as they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People leaving out of violent relationships, people under an uncontrolled and crippling debt burden, divorced families, workers who have been unduly laid off – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Board of Directors of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: An action was brought against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was supposed to be taken after its management had been informed that the manager of North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought on Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the state campaign.
My Bordin says that he has been waiting for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before, according to his own words, he understood that this was not going to happen.
My Bord says in his suit that campaign manager Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed a barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, after submitting a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if a weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The suit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of an additional clause" – who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media took his words out of context and Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his suit, my Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent conduct and Phillip for assault, assault and emotional suffering.
Trump's publicist Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to a message asking him for a comment.
Phillip was never reached despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCB, reported that Phillip recently dropped out of the campaign.
Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, received no immediate response.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case C-365/00 Commission of the European Communities ν Italian Republic
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the most interesting thing in Heathrow. As at the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to benefit our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who feel that the expansion of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
This extension is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by £ 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a powerful task force at Heathrow, which has carried out on time and by keeping to the budget a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included the T5 terminal – which has been voted the best airport terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The Olympic Games in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in anti-advertising cat-mouse games
The attempts of companies that earn money from online advertising to distract anti-advertising software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it was blocking anti-advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog entry where it told users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the label codes for ads on its desktop website so that it would be more difficult for anti-advertising programs to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock tells me he's figured out the new codes.
Adbuck's publicist, Ben Williams, wrote in his blog that "this kind of balling between an open source anti-advertising community and deceivers has been going on since the invention of anti-advertising" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertising protesters have become in the sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising programs," says Pagefair and Adobe last year. This figure has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily on mobile devices by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading anti-advertist programs in its desktop application, as according to the advertiser, mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook's mobile applications and Instagram.
Revenue from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it is updating the user settings advertising tool so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some ordinary Facebook articles.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook's publicist in his email release.
"The anti-property programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of eyewitnesses on the highway for the first hours of Thursday's accident, in which a woman deliberately fell under several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in Vaud canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate work by laying down on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, says Vaud police in her press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and she was clearly trying to commit suicide, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident are being prosecuted.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be investigated by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred that do not hold drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked in the dark on the highway and the court ruled that drivers cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was released from the charge of manslaughter against a man who was on the A1 highway near Paynerne on one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had drunk heavily and passed out on the road.
The Court considered that the police — who were about to respond to the distress call — were justified in driving and that the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to those in the earth, even though Venus is superficially hot and waterless and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous performances of researchers, Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin, earth - similar atmosphere and has, nevertheless, been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS modeling Venus spins slowly and its day-to-day is almost two months at a time per sun," says Anthony Del Genio, researcher at GISS in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface in large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are even a few degrees below the current temperatures on Earth.
The model was used to create Venus's story, which corresponds to the earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, for several billion years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
In hydrogen karate, only a thick CO2 atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained in space — that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up his position as coach at Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, claiming a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Deputy CEO/Director General of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations with energy, passion and determination," says Roy, 50 years old in his communication.
"In the summer, I have long and hard thought about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice-president of the club's hockey operations must be in full agreement with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league for his first season as Avalanche's head coach in 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the extension period in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in 2015–2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing from another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators report that wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties involved in the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been the subject of strikes on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, ‘Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of meetings over the next few weeks which will take place throughout the day to deal with the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent action, which they claimed to have been the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its North Sea contractors' tariffs by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts give it the room to move that is necessary to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of employees from its payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thereby seeking to improve its operations with the British energy company BG Group after its mega fusion.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the British decision of June to leave the European Union put pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major work conflicts that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said that the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not only few," says Anderson.
It is expected that less than USD 1.4 billion will be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to around USD 7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in the Plejad star group
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the speed of rotation of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of the Pleiades star cluster so far.
Based on new information, astronomers can determine why stars of the same star group rotate at different speeds and how the rotations are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between the weight and age of the star and even about the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the University of Pasadena.
The Plejad star group is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many of the stars have been born some 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation peaks, large amounts of star wind are released from the adult stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable starspots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest recorded speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers – the larger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the "dancing" of the Plejades that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejad constellation is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades starbase provides a pillar of support for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
