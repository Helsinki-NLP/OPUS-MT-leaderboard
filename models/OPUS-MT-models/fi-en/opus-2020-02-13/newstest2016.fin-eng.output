Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing persons report about a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no danger to life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-school investigation.
The boy was found near the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, in a frenzy again, tore the paint gap into Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his production in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the final king of the Champions League turned at least for a moment to the latter's advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo went to the top of all time scorer statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, who had been evenly read with him before Tuesday, had a total of 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in Italy's football league Serie A in the early days, but in the Champions League D-block it started with a powerful 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The winner was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was blunted by the absence of the knee-wrenching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's champion league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman, Luke Shaw, had only a quarter of an hour to play the guest game.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the target with ManU kit so badly that Shaw was likely to break his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 cord by 41 minutes, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened out before the break with extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored at the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League of the Painting Age, Paris Saint-Germain of Section A began.
There was an Argentinian Angel Di Maria who changed Manchester United's shirt to the PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past Malmö's goalie, Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been put on the team for the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
It was the first time that PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced Malmö FF for his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsSKA lost in a B-section match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president gave the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe spoke earlier and now on about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council, will assess this request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to better register those who come to Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers belong to the home affairs ministers' table.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the 911 call.
The voice only slightly shivering university teacher Shannon Lamb will tell the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman's relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the page of the booklet: "I'm so sorry that I could take this back I loved Amy and she's the only woman that ever loved me," said a letter that experts said was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe that he shot and killed Ethan Schmidt, the teacher of history, at the door of this study.
Lynn Buford, police chief at Delta State University, reported that university staff heard a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the sound.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have made public reports that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for her classes.
The police at the Prentiss's place of death, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 staff members in total, and many of the students participated in both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and uneasy, "as though something was wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told her that she was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The university principal William LaForge said that, as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped campus, the police found him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, reported the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb took a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, now told by the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Apparently Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told her that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played a few gigs together.
O'Steen told me his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer of The Julep Room, near Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonic performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing with each other. Throwin' at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's student seminar programme and was specialised in the Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candle-drinking was held on Delta State campus in Cleveland, where about 900 people attended, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the University choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb was referring to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers during the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45 000 employees during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although the holiday period is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the "Back to the Future" film was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's seat was next to me," he said in the future documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The movie starts and I think I'm just an artificial yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
A return to the future was premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "I'm sure it's the greatest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available as video subscriptions, DVDs and in some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved with arms
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increase in military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved with arms" and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations with a view to finding a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Ban announced that he would meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the margins of the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when dealing with the Syrian crisis when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 support polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some people have been trying to label him as a windboat.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not been (yet) successful.
Of the last 11 national surveys, 10 Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of the ability of the real estate king to be appointed.
Of course, the parliamentary term is still at an early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership over the emerging Herman Cain, neither of which obtained any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in public elections.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Union Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and begun to use its resources to overthrow him.
The following recent support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August this figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said that they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfactory" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "strung up" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "inspired" vs. Trump's 40%).
The next thing you know, it's the most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "disturbed" if Jeb Bush, a favorite of the authorities, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of the voters on the Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to a Quinnipiac survey last week, in the state of Iowa holding the first party assembly, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey, 44 percent feel that his character is not suitable for being president, and almost six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans believed that Rick Perry would be nominated and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe that Trump's campaign is credible.
Even if Republicans were to stand up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided among many other candidates.
However, a survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were put against each other, Ben Carson would win a businessman Trump with a huge 18-point gap.
Just recently, the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46 percent said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapes" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompousness drives Latino voters away from the Republican party and damages rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration in the government has reached a new peak.
The support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than someone with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corby, the new leader of the Labour Workers' Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby comes up with his first six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and the Labour MEPs will be watching closely for his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for the leadership of Corbyn since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle from Britain Air War, has raised criticisms among the Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that he "stood with respect quietly" and that he acknowledged the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, said to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have asked the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt that the royal house should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in the Corbyn inner circle, arguing for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and originally less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also become "crowded" within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Mr Corbyn said at a meeting of the Trade Union Confederation that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, shadow secretary Smith said that the party was "very clear" that they were simply opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron in the last decade when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "forced" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both witty rhetoric and squirming, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary Angela Eagle will be his substitute for Question Time when Corbyn does not participate - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercowi, on the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theatre that was often linked to Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the Director's judgment, his control over the House of Commons and his position with other MPs, even though critics have criticised Question Time for becoming nothing but a travesty that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Pictured in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound is rising as British wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer of SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it an estimate of the increase in rates.
The pound rose to more than one per cent against USD 1.5505 and 0.84% against EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and increased by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would unite the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 percent after the mine giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company announced its six-month profit before tax: an 83% increase to GBP 46,6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is increased in the UK, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company," Cowgill notes.
The costs could be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grass-roots campaign against Aldi's invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year to South and West Australia, where there will be up to 120 stores. At the same time Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food dealers and build the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA's traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer samples at IGA stores, and store owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organises an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as Southern and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of the IGA trades in Metcash, with higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
The buyers of South and West Australia are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in Eastern countries.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million a year for sale and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west, which will generate $500 million and $600 million in turnover in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's base of high fixed costs can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes," Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 % in 2016; 4.1 % in 2017 and 2.1 % in 2018, with a market share falling from 14 % in 2015 to 10,3 % in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly disappear in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
It has been understood, however, that a member of Metcash's board of directors had contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and profits from Metcash's food and food business, which supplies around 1200 products to an IGA dealer, have decreased by 43 % since 2012.
However, the wholesaler stands up to himself and has invested more than $150 million each year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products each week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by adding more fast-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brands to the market.
Metcash's Director-General, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis association, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered collateral damage in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behaviour," says Steve Healy, president of the Australian League of Tennis.
Mr Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", was unwittingly exposed to the incident where Mr Kyrgios provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after this, in the fiery qualifier in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to dismiss Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen smashing his bat after cramping his potential victory over Richard Gasquet in US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis' unfailing defender.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth in a second place in doubles with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi is just being dragged into a brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, including in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harsh.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard, he fits in with the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the locker room, he trains firmly, is in good shape and is a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time out of the public thinking about these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of daming the flow of immigrants coming into the country.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of immigrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled from the violence in their countries have now set up their tents and set themselves on an indefinite road between the checkpoints of two countries.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants kept saying, "Open the border!" shouting insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it would be "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of Macedonia and Greece arrive.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the 28-national group failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they were hopeful that a final agreement would be reached - by next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries would take up 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and made it possible for you to be closed down and for asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country is also going to set up a barbed wire fence against Romania in order to stop the influx of immigrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4 m (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia as a crime and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"On account of the situation of mass immigration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency," the government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, told journalists in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national security advisor at Orban, said that 45 people had been apprehended by the authorities in their attempts to cross the border, and 15 countries had already gone further.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now incarcerated by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to crowd in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: National survey shows that Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed to half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead in double digits in the Democratic nomination contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders will be closing in on him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (declined from 58%) and the second Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the primary elections began, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand behind their own choice more rigorously than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity among many population groups has fallen since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start with the democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and he is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading with the older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters say that they will be very supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says that they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be very supportive of him.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say that they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton, the Republicans' number one Donald Trump says the same thing with fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate in an open question, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%) and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the woman president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice-president has an influence on a possible presidential nomination, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race - even if a third disagrees.
When asked by democratic voters who they would choose for a second party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to go for the Democratic candidacy, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will increase. If Biden goes, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he does not, the figure is 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who think he is the most voting has increased.
When they were asked what was most important about the candidate, however, they put their opinions ahead of the vote.
Last month, too, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can best handle the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
In general, democratic voters also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of the Democrats say that they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is a foreign minister still raises questions, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their general opinion on him.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that e - mail polemics did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own party consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the country's registered voters do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
The six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush, are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion on him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 democratists is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll.
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the previous CBS survey published on Tuesday, before last month's election debate on Fox News.
At the same time, however, Carson rose dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is replacing Trump with higher-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, apart from Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasich of Ohio. The support for Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest September poll 376 Republican voters is +/- 6 per cent.
Last week's CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though he apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died at the brotherhood's chimp ceremony in the Pocono Mountains District of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College University, New York City, brutally attacked Chu "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, the police noted.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were tied and his back loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, and then repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng passed out, but, according to the accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information about his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national chairman of the brotherhood, asking him for advice, said Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had repeated blunt force traumas to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternisation, when at least one student has died every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County's grand jury was in favour of the first five members being charged with murder in the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, will also be charged with violent impregnation and criminal intrigue.
"We do not want to be held accountable only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what happened that accepted the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood broke off contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The interest rate increase will come and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will be in recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this all takes or how long it takes.
The past does little to help with timing, particularly in terms of the economy.
The result of the recession has taken only 11 months since the first withdrawal, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The U.S. Central Bank's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial assets.
That is why the officials of the Federal Reserve have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but rather on the path towards normalisation.
Yes, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about interest rates has been oversized.
"The central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'low money'," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics Specialist for Global Affairs at Capital Economics in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the progressive return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an impact.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As seen on the market in the last month or so, waiting for interest rate increases can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop at 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what will happen after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14% as the increase is approaching, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6%), and normal conditions have been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the recent analysis by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management's capital strategy, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when profits start to decrease.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of GDP, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the annual nominal GDP of 118 increases since 1950 has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe that it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic environment may be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different," said Deutsche Bank.
The market participants have been prepared for the central bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trade only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all increases have so far occurred in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has expected by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already in progress.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market was waiting for interest rates to be raised, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its line, its effects are reflected more quickly in debt instruments than in shares.
The direction of the proceeds of debt certificates appears to change immediately at the first increase/surge of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the return on bonds will fall immediately," said Deutche Bank.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will result in convergence of yields on long-term and shorter-term debt securities, thereby smoothing out the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns", stated Kathy Jones, a solid income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is evener, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt are doing worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have to finance.
"History shows that ‘quality' shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their customer report.
Enterprises with strong turnover passed the weak turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital return and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
The companies with a high variable interest rate debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's rise.
Savings can also make a profit through higher profits, even though experts disagree with the speed with which the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "recognizance"
He claims that it becomes increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just imitating the Brit Awards.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins criticized The Voice saying that neither was original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims the leading MP, adding pressure to the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "recognise" its content and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between commercial competitors.
"It seems like Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "recognizable" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards that started last year only seem to be a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly: in fact, you're just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial partner as regards live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first class.
"I also think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than it did before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, Member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticised The Voice, the music competition that the BBC purchased from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced "in a BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success within its own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to impose that the money of the grantors be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
The rate of increase last month was lowest after the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November's Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into haunted cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling-out of online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of smoothing of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and come back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, a supplier of the JMRG Sales Index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be doing it in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it evens out, and (growth) can decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing down of trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many buyers flocked to their computers to grab shops, knocking down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who caused buyers to argue about the findings, can control shopping.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Mecca's crane accident, consequences for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mostly white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the mosque roof and poured down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family's construction group guilty of a disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a large mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency stated that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English - speaking service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to find out what caused the cranes to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the Group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around Mecca's large mosque, which are part of the huge building robbery run by Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities report that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European low-cost workers are behind the popularity
The British use more and more assistant services," Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country
Author Rupert Steiner, city's chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paintpants and rather hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs
Looks like if you're smart with a hammer or you're hitting the walls, you're in a minority now.
The British hire more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes," says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new president of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a high price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Crewfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store were specifically made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: Today there are more one - woman households where more home renovations are carried out than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with equal numbers of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group of 50 % women, including its Director General and financial manager.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - the difference is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher announced an invoice for both six months' profits and sales after the group took on the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force the country to stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think there's a lot of reason at the time.
Let's see if it's worth a strike when things are bad.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring a criminal would have been a small person's political suicide.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not budge much, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the aims of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the violent decisions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll in their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the point of defending the rights of the worker, prominently and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to incarcerate the role of the Ay movement, when membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Let's think whatever the organisations do, it's nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's mind.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard saving course: To save 8.5 million, the staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a savings course with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on all personnel with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of around 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The background to the Yt negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding for our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last the six weeks laid down by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to use Finnish railways
The owner of the Halpabus company Onnibus, a British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
First up is local transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the Onnibus plans.
At least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in the rest of Europe, has expressed interest in rail transport from other international companies.
The U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by as the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters questioned 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates are maintained at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is an historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut its interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow.
The US economy has operated relatively well and the recovery has brought billions of dollars to balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the probabilities are against the increase.
The decision will be made public on Thursday at 8 a.m. (CET).
The guy who shot Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning... before shooting her colleague later that same day... Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," told the authorities on Tuesday.
Mississip's Gautier police report that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not disturb anyone" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when he was surrounded by the police.
The university principal William LaForge said that, as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was related to Schmidt, there was no "information or evidence" of any kind of "triangular drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentis had a 19-year-old daughter who is "strung up."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "ever-best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online, and according to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called her relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "she's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb debated educational science at Delta State in spring 2015, says the CV found on the university's website.
Stars Who Lose Their Charmingness
The actor (left), with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he also had drug problems, and in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United destroyed PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Even though the defenseman stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, he's having trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what's gonna happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a punishment shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee erred.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thanks to everyone for your messages, words are not enough to tell how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player goes out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played on the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt your opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed as if he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling sued him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent soon learns something: If your child loves a book, it won't take long to learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's book The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or a message we've never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which a fairly short original text was filled with new characters and details.
"In the city of Nellen, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree," says and describes the love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this is not suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text in some places sounds like it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie found on the Internet Movie Database website, starting with: "In the city of Necessity, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted's son hopes to win over the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
In view of Cameron's public activity as a parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so indiscreet with the plot of the book. Here the young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-crushing and needy Kerskanen, ignoring the short, mustached creature Lorax, who speaks for the trees.
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment has probably been outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the English team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the last 3-0 series loss is likely to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a guest victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but there are good twisters and the team's thinking is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds, and Adil Rashid is an attacker, even though he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell off the British cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult to analyse for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers under challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at strangers.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moene in an opening next to Cook has been thrown, so that we can get an extra pitcher on the field but we can keep four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit him there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is their third and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games with the first roll down before he moved on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a backup pitcher, and, just a little of what I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpretentious statistics, hitting the average of 31, with the ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there are not too many pitchers and voters chose young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach's team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan hitter, as a consultant in the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the games of the white ball, bringing both energy and a ruthless glimpse.
I've always thought that he was born to be a part of international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the kind of brain that Mahela uses.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is getting rest at one-days, Root was given a similar break from Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and pickers don't make schedules.
And one must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiating strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic every day, even if we do not even take into account the hearty Jeremy 'Is it yes or no'?
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centered British agenda, which is full of concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not want to see for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided not to want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfieagenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then coming home to say that they will win supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capital cities are now at a point where they do not care if we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before it gets ruined in the same way that it did for the too long-timed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years) and Kohl (16 years).
French François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of the selfies, when their energy should rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless comments in the Scottish National Party style during the British referendum campaign of 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations were arranged "and the renegotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how gluttonous Fleet Street newspapers can be and how sceptics of the press are, which they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro opportunist who named himself by writing "EU straight bananas" when he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a wide range of tax-expanding rascals, phones-hacking foreigners, and people who have their nominal place of residence and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the deception if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more of ablair than Blair himself, as regards the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation act, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back of the Westminster Parliament building on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-emerging Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed Europe.
Well, the vast majority of people outside the British Independence Party's Ukip military passion and the most fierce nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly take up this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell as the finance minister of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law struggled on TV to try to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party's government without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's struggles were more appealing.
But the fight to keep up with "any situation" - Benn's comment - was not what McDonnell said, and not everything that Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchy, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in social media twists, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, the basic cycle between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing fellows for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats simply have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British influenza Security Forum on Monday.
Experts critical of Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional ones was triggered by a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links with the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) associated themselves with Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic tobacco.
PHE published this report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and have referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the PHE's main conclusion on the "exceptionally brittle base".
The other two researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that the PHE's argument that "e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco" is based on detailed assessment and modelling of evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose director-general is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the money he was reported to have received earlier from Philip Morris International, they are adding.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electronic tobacco, some of which also report that they have received funding from the sector.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco director.
The research produced by the group "manyly admits" that there is a lack of "incontrovertible evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence for the time being that electronic tobacco acts as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at the PHE, says that the claims made at the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electrical cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electronic tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though electronic cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" from such hits as this soap series on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, on difficult broadcast times against the most watched programmes of competitors and on such channels as the BBC4.
After the BBC president Tony Hall said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that would be suitable for clearly unsubvented competitors," Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it is a good idea for this media or, in the long term, it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being sent to the most important broadcast time, because as much support as possible is being collected for its future.
The idea that no one else shows the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes which could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders is another, admittedly within the house executed.
Frankly, the other channels would give anything to do with it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is responsible for the hunting of audiences "because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience's public service programmes "will go to BBC4, where the number of viewers cannot often be measured, but the BBC will thus fulfil its responsibilities and then, in defending the £4 billion licence revenue, can hypocritically state that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is looking at'.
They'll put them on a mission site where no one will ever come to see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money because they don't use much BBC.
David Elstein, former director of Sky and Channel 5, who also witnessed to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its mission during Reith 'to inform, train and entertain'.
He said that only a small proportion of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model from Australian and Canadian broadcasting and transform the task into "information, education and entertainment".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, he said, are only showing a few on television, and join with commercial companies to make them all accessible online.
"Audiogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them by sound waves.
The tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, a invasive procedure whereby electrical impulses are introduced into the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttles do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by fluid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasound waves, which then passed through the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect TRP-4-ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce nematode-controlled nematode worms, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified carpets, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turned on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some features similar to those of optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that there may be some advantages in the use of sonogenetics compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired location inside the brain, low - frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible to cause the target human nerve cells to react temporarily to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertising puts Britain's arms trade in shame.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapon show video.
Horrible killer planes!
Leghold traps crushing ankles!
Grape bombs!
And electric stunning batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and the image language of the comics leaves no doubt that this advert of the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to repressive governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in the London Shipyard Area.

A separate campaign also brought many posters to bus stops and metro trains requiring a closer look.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together is asked using London's underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a image of the tank.
In this September, a bunch of gun dealers will be arriving on the DLR route... customers will be asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were displayed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Path Group helped to spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. It is a six-pound package of hexagon keys that, according to the collective, "can access one third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised "proclaimed vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Path Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in resistance chests when they realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by VCCP, and the graphic designer and background researcher also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever discovered that the gun fair was not advertised at all, and there was an empty section on ExCeL's calendar at the time, and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of obscure corporate governance, but "it was more stopping to stress the issue with bright colors and animation".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at fairs," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
In its press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the United States Army for "AT4CS RS to launch from the shoulder".
This includes "the unique pipe bethead, which has excellent effects on the back of the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It's been 11 years since I was an ignorant 19-year-old and moved to a dormitory, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated and the numerous long complaints about others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can be anything from a nerve to a completely scary one.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, where you liked the year off and where you're thinking about Corbyn, and why "I don't really love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast for HAKE to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the people you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie evenings and public entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
College's a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of room-to-room travel that is friendly, social and makes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when the speech came, knock.
A guy at my dorm said if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the top of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cupcake plate and introducing yourself seems a little less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your cohabiting partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will continue to associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It's possible they'll give you permission even though they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my dorm buddy who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make such noise that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making their own music roar, locked her doors and took a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought your roommate was your future spouse, got together, got divorced, and then you saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense into your lower head.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but you can cancel in an instant.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something... but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker more than twice.
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - House planned as a reception center was soiled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out at the accommodations of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers but those of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at the Evankelinen folk high school in Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodations," says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the teacher responsible for youth guarantee training at Kansanopisto, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and grown-up people are free to move, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the folk high school.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the mess-up building has a status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, there was a press conference for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Lukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of doing so, and they had been travelling on a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth's weekend night when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been soiled and a reception center has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
On Tuesday night, MTV reported this on its website.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A police report has been filed.
Revision 15.9. at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa. The passengers are upset, "unintelligently idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news was indignant at passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki Central Railway Station.
In particular, the shutdown strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's completely idiotic because the population is growing and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on HSTV's interview video he'll be coming to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a citizen of Siuntio, considers that the state's train cutter is short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
Then there's regret.
The Y train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those traveling further than the city area by train.
"It's especially bad for those who have to redeploy their journey," he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is coming.
A new train connection is likely to come to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Managing Director of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi explains that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million for the Y train in a year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has certainly paid much more than this.
The R line on the main line will miss two stations.
Instead, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Säinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Trobbing.
Train services decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys per year are made on stopping shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million a year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Currentness book: "Marx is worth studying"
The global economic crises have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his principal work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital's topicality.
"He is now taken more seriously than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase also includes Professor of Aalto University, the respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Economics and the Business Delegation is not Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the idea tells of false opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of capitalism," Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological upheaval," Korkman analyses.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be brought to an end.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to study Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Mao and Trotsky and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset as well as other classics," Korkman says.
UN demands war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, says AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report blames both the armed forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not exactly accurate.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, a major military attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The report blames Sri Lanka's armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
According to the report, both sides have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of a UN tribunal because foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed you to weigh social media
On Wednesday, the student articles in the autumn were a long foreign language, which most people had English.
English skills were tested by over 16,000 trainees.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the English word 150 to 250 could be addressed to the director of the online magazine's advisory column.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people too.
In total, there were four subjects of which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic by Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish High School.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
On the other hand, Lybeck said that the fourth topic was nice.
It had to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we have practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment "unlikely normal".
In English or Swedish, the English experiment allowed questions to be answered about texts such as adaptation of flounder to climate change and handling large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when another Finnish or Finnish experiment will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, which means that it is not affected by employees' demonstrations.
The matriculation examination board advises the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time for them to attend the trial.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters arriving in Helsinki - support units from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's cutting decisions will stop the city centre on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
In turn, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm missions and other police activities, but also to ensure that the expression of a giant mind is carried out.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at Kaisaniemi's roundabout, from the west to Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a stand on a cop's industrial battle.
According to Kujala, support units from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us exactly what patrols are.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
The police recommend that private cars be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sum extends from Hakaniemi level to its core center.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, a lot of charter buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to Railway Square.
In principle, buses remain quite distant.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand at these big people's gatherings, will now be dealt with partly by itself.
The protestors have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good benchmark in Finnish political history for it," says Emeritus Siiiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder he's protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government," says Siisainen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the cores of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are interfering with contract law.
There are a lot of features here that we are really trying to get the Ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the AY movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among those who the Ay Movement would like to be involved in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you look for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed," says Siisiäinen, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (Kesk) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the days of Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
Moreover, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power," says Siisiäinen.
The present coalition of governments is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite what the Finns said.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the greatest for years.
In recent years, approximately 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
They're from side to side.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations of the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protest avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property," says Siisainen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on themselves.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen got a 16 percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts throughout the country.
Breakthrough Thursday, 1993
On 4 November 1993 some 20 000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliamentary House to demonstrate their work.
Firefighters striked for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
'Siberia teaches, the EU stops' was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers dropped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and the collective resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation eventually speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors Striked 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and led to a lively discussion on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Some 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to Parliament House in 2013.
The Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Crime Police for assistance in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees on board in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Finnish public limited company, the truck belongs to the Finnish public limited liability company, which first reported its cooperation with the Austrian police.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, carry on trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the chain burning captain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing with his blue, ten - foot [10 m] wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns approximately 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going out at midnight. We're going out. We're going out at midnight.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and at 20 meters [20 m] high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he's beating his clients and at least saying he's gonna beat them to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south side of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine is running out and it's already seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city, men who travel without their family stay in tents, rafts and abandoned cars, which has now been found or built by anyone.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When people finally arrive at the Bogovaða area, the great hub of human smuggling, they are dying tired.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say things once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran won't like that.
That's a silly piece of shit all the way.
First, a price of EUR 300 is set, for example, and then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than everyone else and he's only charging 50 euros for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles, most of the highway is nice.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a great sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and screams out.
At Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where many believers who have fled the Congo are visited, and a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
For a missionary, it's important to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the missionaries' five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully, and slob among the cross - border peddlers.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they come from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be purchased.
That's how the Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers will go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs approximately EUR 100, handling documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and moving to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They're driving the A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to the rest stop where the drivers sleep before proceeding across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts through the safety cable of the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same kind that is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene hoping he doesn't have to drive stowaways before Britain does.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Kedk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
The up-and-coming Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the unquestionable king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which dominates the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, K.q. has been operating and continuously developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury craft scheme: the Turkish ports are renting yachts to take American or European families for a few days on tourist cruises.

An American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
Three times in the Olympic Games, the new book by the 1,500 - meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton in his book Fast Girl tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published sections of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top shape and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
But in the finals, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
However, 500 feet [150 m] before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line," says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
Another explanation for Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was that he longed for adrenaline peaks similar to those he had received when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came to light at the end of 2012 when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 3,57,40 feet [1,500 m] in world statistical number one, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the Federation disciplined Norway's ski rooster: "Straightback"
The Norwegian ski king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the sports contract for the whole summer and autumn of last year.
Although the Union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup of the coming season.
The decision was commended by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union got the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing to the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that would also care for future generations and would not allow one athlete to go solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that Northug had been granted privileges from both financial and other sources for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Championship medals in her career, including two gold medals.
He was on the team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
Roast compilers' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Roast Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry skills and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of the high quality.
At the same time, we would like to point out that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
International attention to the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola there is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The decision has therefore been made to make the event one of the most significant international events that will take place in the same day around the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre for the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a reception centre for refugees in the premises of the ex-apartment of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still permanently located in the region, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Eellisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private person, investing a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has not also been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
The case states that, for the last two years, the Kauhava airport has been the subject of negotiations on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This matter has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (p.a.) and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of objecting in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
Kauhava City Council discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö comments to the journalists at night after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia's and the United States' actions in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and consequently in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the further tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niistö, the NATO issue was also addressed in discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.

The Department of Early Education promises to inform you more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communications need a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to the journalists in the Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on Yle's channels.
If any other channels report as a channel, we'll see.
Now let's use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio speech to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipila takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell of a more general introvert of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse the question of a public debate? is considered by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of the media, by definition, to ensure that political agendas are not adopted.
According to Koivuse, television talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In this sense, it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in the interests of Yle or in the general sense.
Sneaky bet from the bristle
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in the future speech of Sipilä, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, you should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä because it allows him to bring out his own vision without the use of gravel.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong because there will be no more specific questions.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether the sweat is dripping, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipil to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different if the government were to inform something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly (US President Barack).
That's really exceptional.
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister should speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, wage-earners' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give her speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed.
The Chairman of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide in the endless world, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's been found and in the city, his father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to Iltälehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer in contact.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
A Kurdish martial artist Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street brawls among young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed in the young people's fad.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other one, and hit without thinking of any of these consequences, what will happen when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani upgrades.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people seen in the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Chief Inspector Jarmo Heinonen of the Helsinki police, fighting videos have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you're fighting at the top of the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come up in gross numbers.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever end up being subjected to racism, you'll blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys make me hate that I don't like either.
You're doing a pretty bad job and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employee association will discuss its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff centre association STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind it.
However, it would require SAK, the largest organisation of employees, to soften its previous position.
The President of SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on the matter in a narrow way on Twitter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of compulsory laws.
Mrs Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä interrupted negotiations on a social agreement when the SAK refused to commit itself to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: "It's a bit funny to put your fist out"
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in an employee camp.
Is it supposed to call the government down, or is it supposed to make up with it?
On Monday, the s.K.A.'s union leaders breathed holy hatred against the republican government.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavans.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was a conciliatory act by the chairman of the staff centre organisation STTK.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he would produce an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Kesk) as a 5% productivity leap.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hastened immediately to announce that his papers have already been completed.
At first, there was no sound from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to reach an agreement when the union leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Ilmaus, Director for Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhansen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described the government's ay expertise as improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost from Finland's solsticemen, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pieinen (sd).
It's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket if you've already got a settlement paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, in which Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were coerced by the European Union, to come to a meeting - an issue on which the President was able to remind journalists.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Interfax, Naryshkin stressed.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pry Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Tappara and the Clave will continue today in the haka forest as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today there will be no actual goal party in Hakawood.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to carve 3-2-end-of-the-mill KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock on Tuesday was a lot better than that.
The Blues, who started the Rauman catch with a tangled start, had round zero points, and also loss figures 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-off Janne Lahti anticipates layouts on the club's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the people of Rauma.
After all, Tappara has dropped in the semifinals in the previous two periods just after the Clave's final series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in group compositions except for goalies.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday will have a flute today.
With Tapara's goal Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: Ässissa Ässissa kässä kässä käyttön play
Toivola, sports director, wrote an inappropriate sequel to the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie in which he himself played the lead.
Sensationally, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy when he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
Unnamed and wooden-handed casserole advanced to everyone's amazement at the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irokes.
Hope child became blonde.
J.P. Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that the new work of this period will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for the Ässi has built a casserole on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pounding guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen's merits lie in something other than playing in the disc.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock with Sean Connery.
Iron Rock in Toivola's manuscript Rocky is as clumsy a lead as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's nothing else in Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigs.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garrett Stafford hit Tapara Jere Karelian on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play with us are the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not a game of ace hockey, and iron rock, which was hot after the game, went off on the Satakunta people.
The team of Ässien this season is strangely built.
There's kids, there's veterans, there's cops, there's guys who want to talk to you.
In practice, there are no key men of the highest age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about a skill shortage.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smudge under the surface.
In the 1953 model, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Aces balance in the three league games of the season has as many losses in goal difference 1-6.
Hopela shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it seems crazy, and the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulanna's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
Sirkka has helped so much.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly coloured.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become Finland's largest band.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really sad.
There was little chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about Tuukka's youth even before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her youth was completely different from the notorious skit story of Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday girl and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project doesn't scare him.
It's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Italy often plans to drive home for the sake of their young children because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, simply asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive drama film in Finland
The budget of Timo Vuorensola's film Iron Sky: The Coming Race is 17 million euros.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel of the Scif film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion of Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Descriptions of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare me.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
I love going to Belgium.
Just because time is tight doesn't mean there's fear in your ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
But you could shove 100 million into the film because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything's so tight, it's not loose.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years' time at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What's the deal with the hillbilly or the cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the Trendsters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
The advertising of a hoodie or T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
It's times that change.
Sporting has become the real megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to turn into irony and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mundane fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by preferring the most boring basic clothes as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey standard collegiate, you're going to put on the sweat shirt that is buried at the bottom of the closet and the manufacturer's logo is shown in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' identifiable trackcoats, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees hats have made a return to street fashion.
The beginnings of the jeans are the Calvin Klein logos of the underpants, which are now cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sport signs to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's fall sweaters makes it clear what the clothing is.
Would you be ready to display logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
There have been colorful claims in recent days in the media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove Zotov of large size from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least, from their images, it's not a matter of getting stuck or angry.
That's a bunch of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel. I've served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained that he had admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, and I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall, I'm fat, but nothing like me stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged deadlock have been published, even though 50 000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with the case of Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he struggled out of the tank door to try and finally threaten to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the organisers of the exhibition gave their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition coordinator Alexander Pisarevsky Bloknot.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The refined process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sands tank into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, water is pumped either for re-use as process water or, according to the permit, it is discharged through the surface drainage field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
There was no other material draining into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says that it cooperates closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contractual system and for unemployment benefit.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment contains a lot of sympathetic messages for government action, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented within the shortest possible time frame in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects today, in his new cyclical forecast, that growth will fall to zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total production was growing slightly in the summer," Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention could be paid to the lack of confidence in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, these differences are only a few percentage points.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday," Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat company bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minor applicants disappear each year, among other things, on the OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter website.
The Finnish Immigration Service's Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under country" per year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared," says Kannelmaa.
The reasons for this disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so that adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years," he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a minor who is alone.
The overall statistics on minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is also likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have been converted?
Do they also disappear, for example, into the 'dark labour market'?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Secretary's meeting, Orpo, who was discussing refugee issues, announced on Monday the practical steps to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices
Timo T.A. Mikkose's equipment for TV and radio productions is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in her field.
The online announcement was the first thing that told me about the online magazine Iltamakasini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been overtaken by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer on Betacam tapes.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested ones.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in Stormlän.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started," says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV or radio equipment of its own anymore.
After recent strokes, it is clear that the man who made a long career will never return to work again.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute in the summer, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether they will extend the force in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, head of trust, says he's a big man on the field.
So the government's plans to cut the sheets raise opposition.
Mrs Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is, however, a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will be virtually completely stopped.
According to VR's records, trains don't run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL's records, most of the buses stay in the pits.
ACP Members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning at 3 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superiors, HSL's publicist Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell exactly which buses to take on Friday.
Wage and salary earners' organisations organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11 am to 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the Associated Press.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a high school in Texas, and the teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered his own-made watch to be a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News all he wanted to do was show off his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the clock to look like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy may be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering whether this case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's uproar - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour MPs.
This has offended the people, thought Labour MP Kate Green at a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's memorial was honoured by the battle of British Air Force pilots against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in silence during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Among the MPs in particular are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity and increasing public spending.
Today, for the first time, Corbyn is due to appear as party leader in Parliament at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron wrote on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for the family killing in Minnesota is still unclear. The father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota, for almost a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was their father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three of his children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for a visit and found Short's family dead all over a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Mintonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site every week.
I've had 50 takeover bids made in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was shown by the fact that the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow for a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a coffee cake.
In addition, the owner trio was awarded at the race event with the Finnish Horse Owner of the Month of Hippos.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on his honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and made a profit of 100 000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the success horse gets the full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is going to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest contribution ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital's bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's contribution is thus significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously made significant contributions to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city's major hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening, serve the food with nothing but bikinis and aprons on.
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and the hungry.
There's news from Metro.
You can order for yourself a wife or husband for the evening at the Ore no Yome cafe in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the spouse of a client.
"Half" is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is facing only an apron and bikini with her husband in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length of the marriage candidates and always puts pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: car security attacks started to take place
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field, says Intel's release.
The Board is made up of top experts in the field of security from around the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB's research.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimated that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS's information now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, and it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in its release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt car show - the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two new ones, with which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European design director, is more round.
An inch into the shafts and outer dimensions of the vehicle and the car splits the air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but it has been added a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to the sales.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, as we will receive the new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the end of the year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
The starting point is to obtain Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when they are accompanied by Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
About the same time it's coming in, we're starting to sell Optima Farmer.
Chisu went back to the stage, ranting in a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu participates in the Life for Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's a nice, open neckline in an electric-blue pantset.
The costume presents beautifully the delicate waist of the singer star.
The whole thing is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on the stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release her new album, and at the same time her fourth one, called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes me again. Now you see the breast.
The true beauty Kim Kardashian gives the subjects one after the other.
He presents his pregnant stomach and chest equipment freely in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the lightning lights flash, it reveals the color of the bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity dress was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black upper knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was in the pregnant stomach.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speaking Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out of the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you were in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will start with Castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry that compete with old-timers for work.
Models rarely have places to call home.
The work is continuous travel and may take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the jobs they want, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinnyness.
Agent New York may ask you to drop the kilos, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, it's hard to break up.
Models want this sector because of its potential, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that the job is just a showdown of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities, too.
The job makes the models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
The models last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the movie.
Scrooge Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the Apulanta group in the early years.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people in that group, so I think it's okay that I learn his style only from video.
I don't want to do an impression of a person.
A man who leads a band called Scrooge Salminen and Dogs is not going to play the role.
The Punk Manerians come with the man naturally.
I'm sure in the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many people saw a foretaste, the same if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything petty, but we always go to the fullest.
In Apulina, Tuukka Temose, who played bass in 1993-2004, released the leading actors of "You Made us Beautiful" film today.
The core group that became familiar to the audience of the band is presented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Timosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his future job last night when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published a picture of his new look in Instagram yesterday, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to consider in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling you about it at all?
There is no need to raise this issue by force, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Younger children should be protected, for example, not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can hang on in their minds and distress them, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth raising the question.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to raise the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how this is viewed in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will get a model for dealing with difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.

You're out of your own strength?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the Pallosalamaa that hits Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to fine-tune Apila's Pallosalama in midsummer.
It was only racing for profit and second place until the end of July in Tampere raves came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but it took two drops of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku in its record time the second SE-tamma after the Tarunwind.
Apila's Pallosalama was under great pressure from the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
With those things in mind, the slight deflection at the end was understandable," says the North.
The coach assumes that a proper competition was good for the stallion.
The horse's spirit certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would also have stabilized.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it's not in the mood, it could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been torn off by such a bolt of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, rivals are unable to cope with the Pallosalama, which even has warm - blooded rides.
There's a race in Vermo.
But the difference is, how does Apila's Pallosalama agree to that?
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the truck and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku leaves.
Apila Pallosalama can also come from the bow when she's okay, and we're going to drive it for victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook, CEO of the company in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone features a number of programs that are relatively few to use: For example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks on the face.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications worked closely with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or by 0.1 per cent from one year ago, as reported today by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in prices was pushed down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
Inflation was 0.2 per cent in July.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat estimated base inflation at 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU of 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in Malta in August, or 1.4 per cent of the euro countries.
Cyprus had the lowest inflation rate, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently distant from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2% increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed is next trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year's time, but more assuredly within three years after the country's Central Bank, Fed, takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that it might start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can be at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate squeeze before then.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets do what they used to do - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed the Long-Term Asset Return Study report over 60 pages to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who drew up the study and report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as in previous interest rates - and what may be the result.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more flimsy state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
♪ Not even a year before the recession ♪
The leaders who decided on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have all over last summer and early autumn hinted that the time was coming to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in more than nine years may already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Directors of Fedi meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points for exactly two years, increasing Fed's interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the US's most risky housing financing, and one year later the financial crisis was torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, severe financial market and real economy setbacks started at a slower pace than has typically been the case since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turn of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact will be reported from the 1950s onwards.
In most cases less than three years and on average less than three and a half years have elapsed since the beginning of the recession.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has increased its steering rate by a dozen cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects from others, and there is a relatively limited number of times under review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be unquestionably identified even by decades of research.
But for the reasons that led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power, there are three things that are somewhat beyond question:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and the other largest central banks in the world considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were patching up the tracks of the techno bubble, and they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the level of debt accumulated and already excessive in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased even more as a result of central banks' over-reliance on monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history until then was born.
3) In particular, the almost unbridled financial economy's craziness in debt financing has swelled the largest exchange rate bubbles from shares in real estate, debt and commodities in most financial markets in the past.
There is hardly a great deal of controversy about the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to a height on increasingly complex debt lines, were in a particularly dangerous and unstable state of affairs, as the last time Fed and the other central banks were pushing interest rates upwards.
The financial structures built on debt bonds, let alone the valuation bubbles, did not last more than a while after the interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not guess what is going to happen next, but give cause for alarm by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
( 2) For a long time, debt has not been crazier than it was ten years ago, but now, at its lowest, debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but is now a much heavier debt burden in various parts of the economy than in the past and never before in the past.
3) Liquidity from central banks, which has become more frequent and cheaper than before, has largely remained in the financial markets and has reached the highest levels of key securities and assets, whether at the peak of or never before the financial crisis.
And not only with financial market warnings, they point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession in decades.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are far greater than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its financial stakes.
Maybe the future of Albert Edwards, the future of the French bank Societe Generale strategist, isn't as strange as it seems.
He has been preparing the bank's international investors for Fedi's next round of turns for a long time:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for Fed to run off with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP's business service provider," says the company.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer Pc machines and printers.
HP's personnel peaked in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to transfer its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update release
You can ask for a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone gives an option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when a "Software Update Failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to gain space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that proposes the applications to be deleted and then reinstalles them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is loaded or near the charger during the upgrade that the battery is not running out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it may result in the upgrade being broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Ms Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, said that she was a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timeframe," Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs's holdings are carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second largest owner in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capital investor who has a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the benefits of the capital of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not subject to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' private equity fund, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoon Otaniemi opens the first reception centre for adults for asylum seekers maintained by the company.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants already today starting at 6:00 p.m.
The number of places to stay may increase within one week to a maximum of 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the real estate of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STK is preparing an alternative work-related blackmail package
STK will start preparing an alternative package for the government's work-related blackmails.
The organisation also wishes to include other employee centre organisations.
Mr Palola said that at the moment the attention is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then come back.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday," Palola pointed out during the break of the organisation's administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STK economists have calculated that the security of change provided by the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I do not know whether there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there is a one-to-one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiating link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has asked for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because the government is then due to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place for staff members at STTK Airport.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is carrying out some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the TTK does not give a warm welcome to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the Finnish Government's blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, for example, the wages of the first days of illness will be cut, overtime payments will be reduced to half, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
It is stressed from the STK that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder Thanks you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, congratulates the STTK on preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government presentations has been outlined in Akava for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be involved in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want security of change and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate a 5% competitive jump in the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Arava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's line, as GTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country," says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the willies" - playing bingo while Sipilä talks at night
Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere tonight.
In the past, the prime ministers have given special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go back to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a television speech.
Single phone call, monarchy action.
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day long.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give her speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, Ville Niinistö "one-calling has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Erkki Tuomioja condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
The SDP president, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What is the fear of @juhapila?
Public service
According to the Finnish Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts approximately 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
There has been criticism of Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote public publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news by Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like We're in Tammelas time ♪
The speech has also sparked blasphemousness.
When the evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed well in advance, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
Mom's gonna wear the nicest dress, and Dad's gonna fit his tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, the television was silenced as before in the days of Me Tammelas," writes the bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government who hide their capital in tax havens, who make pardon laws for other tax avoidance friends and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state is running out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published the bingo on Facebook.
Are we going to hear about the same boat, the common coal, the debt and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 9:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed al-Assad to give way in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in any case within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points of plan in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition had to be immediately connected with Al-Assad and the resignation of al-Assad had to be carried out in a subdued manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told her what I was doing there and she said, "Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats have no comment.
Ahtisaari reports that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused any agreement that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, has doubts about the speeches of Ahtisaari, because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said that even if he did, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power over some Al-Assad supporter.
A River of Refugees From Our Own Works
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, some 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Applicants to työhtö Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty building of Tornio's joint declaration in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat announced that the Council would have already decided to present the school building as a farm solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present.
13 delegates were opposed to the Organization Centre.
Based on this, one might expect a positive decision," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and a quick response was received.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time could be accommodated in the joint statement.
An expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense," says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central), the public half of the holiday money would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on this.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for ways to replace the blackmails in the working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, the halving of the locusts would act as a means, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
The social partners could agree on a cut in holiday money because they are enshrined in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will be reporting to Parliament next Wednesday on the blackmail of working life as a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long for things like this to happen if you have the will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the Epiphany and the Helatorista into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages for the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are reduced by half, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has given rise to strong criticism.
On Friday, because of these activities, wage-based central organisations are organising a major demonstration and several trade unions have announced political strikes.
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Mahlahall warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the warehouse at Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahall.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than was originally said.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also somewhat surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock at 400-450 m2 was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided on later in the context of the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian Language Places in Joensuu
The City Government eased its previous steep stance to bring street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian language is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more of an Eastern Savonian dialect.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for Karelian language use in information boards and tourism marketing, for example, on a case-by-case basis.
The same approach is recommended by the city for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth being open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still one of the peculiarities of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both can well be used in the multifaceted marketing of the province.
The closure of rail lines cuts the vitality of the province
Train cuts hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all," says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also points out the issue of air transport, which has also been the subject of several reports.
It is important for the whole province that we do not have the chance to reduce our chances of doing so by means of government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen points out.
The deterioration of accessibility poses a further challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkrinen, the recruitment manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because of the lack of cross-border connections.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them come from New Zealand, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's sotelle
Joensuu City Board's view of the Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
At the Board meeting on Monday, Mr Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the picture) presented a proposal to abandon the whole project, but his presentation was unsound.
The Board approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of trains.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains is missing, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one of them couldn't get down, the guys got out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed the roof out of trouble who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at 5:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away and passersby called the rescue department to help the last one safely left on the roof with drawknives back to the surface.
FedEx's operating profit is two-fold, decreasing the outlook for tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its entire year's performance forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services and the higher costs of its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50 000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May at $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were waiting for $10.84, reporting in a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came in spite of an average price increase of 4.9%, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November for heavy or large parcels on land.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and e-commerce is growing.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "will be stable in view of weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
The plans for salaries during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that he would hire 90-95 000 extra workers, approximately the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is $2.44 on average. The survey by 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zack's poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the increase in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the latest quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues of the operations were basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx's shares dropped to $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
FedEx closed the record for this year by 11 percent on Tuesday and 17 percent below June 11.
The decision-makers of the Federal Reserve this week sit around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two - story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the financial interests of the nation above anything else.
Congress has placed two responsibilities on the Central Bank's shoulders: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, the leaders of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted; the decision as to whether the US economy is ready to be weaned out of a record incentive that has been brought up to the end of 2008 by the almost zero short-term interest rate level .
Although most of the data show a steady economic growth, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made the bank officials, who are already on guard in advance, even more alarmed as regards increasing instability.
"I understand that the labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for maintaining interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficient to justify waiting," he says.
There is no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of the financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank increases its level, unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the shock by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Chief Economic Specialist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the Central Bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would reassure the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the Central Bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would ensure the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen has said in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding further economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to what the Central Bank considers to be the limit on full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, according to the central bank's decision-makers, the main reason for this is the temporary effect of the price of oil that has been significantly lowered.
The economy "is clear about and needs higher interest rates, taking into account the tight situation on the labour market", says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics' Chief Economics Specialist.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its record in May, as investors feared that China would slow down global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation, which indicates when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of China's economy in recent weeks, decision-makers would step up this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal regarding the consequences of what has happened in China," Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not one of the central bank's main concerns, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, then president, hinted that the Central Bank could "reduce" the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lecker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to the movements of the financial markets which appear to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lecker, a member entitled to vote on the Committee, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth", Mr Lecker says.
A year later, the Central Bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest fixing committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level," says Posen.
"No one wants to be in a situation where interest rate increases are feared because the market is upset," says Mr Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Pediatric Society in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breast-feeding women
Brazil's Pediatric Organization (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast - feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in ratings, despite the Nine channel's efforts to announce the leadership coverage in Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal Party's exposure failed to increase Today's ratings.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull overturned Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Army, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to interfere with Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average audience was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared with 339 000 in Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today's been catching Sunrise for the past few months.
In August today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40 000 and 50 000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 admissions, compared with 314 000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven channel was the amazing first performance of the 800-word series, the former star of the Packed to the Rafters series Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which collected an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson is the most popular driving force in the series without Rebecca Gibney, the Rafters star.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
There was a double fate on Seven on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new show gathered 446 000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - which was enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuiren's Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour audience averaged 520,000 admissions, and the second half-hour number was skyrocketing 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's fall in second-night viewer average gives the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular programme at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minutes program, which failed to reduce McGuire's ratings.

The final trio agrees with Daddy that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markowski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three girls left are definitely not slipping who got the last rose.
However, in our discussions with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could, however, inadvertently give a clue about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women became poetic in telling how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveness as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
When they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?", their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markowski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house (Sarah) the energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
It seems like they're having a good time and a good time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's house visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls that are left just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team and Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first kickback when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday at 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and brought him into the running game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
The 49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the kick that the Minnesota Vikings picked up on the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the start that Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wanted for a man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the airport after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio pair team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her haparing to her 2007 Origin debut when the pitch in her own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo published on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Mr Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died while the police fired rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four - year - old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a mob that protested against the country's new draft Constitution, the official reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had met outside the police station and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before using rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The conflict was the latest in the weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new Constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the clauses in the draft Constitution in Katmandu, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane
On the broad low - pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
On the second closely defined low - pressure front, which is halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, there is also a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami increased.
Google launches a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GooGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees from Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published its donation campaign blog.
Instead of being reported by the director, his own personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who, at the age of seven, fled Kabul with her family.
"Our travels included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are given to four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without frontiers, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it will match the same amount to every donation made on the global google.com/refugeerelief site up to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing from war - stricken Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefit of weight loss surgery in mildly obese type 2 diabetic patients may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after a diet surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"Death data takes a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is an expert in weight reduction surgery who wrote an editorial on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Different methods of reducing stomach size are used for weight loss or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study were pathologically obese and had a BMI of 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and stomach reduction, to the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut-off persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 persons who were treated by means other than surgery.
Thirty-six per cent of the cut-off persons had a complete improvement and 28 per cent had a partial improvement.
By comparison, the overall improvement in diabetes in the treatment group was only 1% and in part about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL column "were generally better in the surgery group", the authors noted.
Researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin levels of A1c dropped from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glycemic control" described by improved haemoglobin levels A1c did not, however, reduce mortality over five years, says chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the end of the fifth year, when compared to the gastric surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7% and 14.2 kg), decreased its body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased its haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%) and had been more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to a longer life for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese persons undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a period of 15 years when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 and interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously when the patient is BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethical research.
The Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should prevail over individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of many thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how can we bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate point is to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the question of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused violent events in the chain.
"After 9/11-Isku I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem would be through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, the ingestion of a child's hand-disinfectant has increased fourfold.
Poisoning Focal Points across the United States have reported a strong increase of nearly 400% in the ingestion of alcohol-containing hand-infectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports the Georgia Toxicity Information Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the head of the Georgia Poison Information Centre, the cases of ingestion of disinfectants reported to the poison information centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or meet the challenge in social media.
On YouTube, there are videos where teenagers drink disinfectants to get a cheap boom.
Reports show that teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are those with added fragrances.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant in the hands may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in small children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Hospital's Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please don't leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but leave the hand-drying agent out there, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six - year - old girl who recently swallowed only four drops of strawberry - scented disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drinking limit, says First Aid Clinic physician Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl outside Atlanta at the Gwinnet Medical Center.
Nhaiiah mossed while talking and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head," Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," said Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol swabs and remove disinfectants from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient in their hands.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York state, three fourth graders planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant in her hands and denied it in her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "drunk nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumors: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths undermines the talk of Celtic conflict, and Delia admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he can turn it around.
The Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against the January recruitments that could interfere with the team's unity.
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-half shoot took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at the Pittodrian Stadium and gave the team the chance to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths is underestimating what he says about conflict.
There have been rumours about the internal conflicts within Celtic, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under greater scrutiny when the team is preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for a championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "There will be no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People around here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tension, and non-Scotlanders also want to follow them.
Delilah swears she'll turn the situation around.
Ronny Delia has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
Loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series by a five-point difference to the next.
But Delia said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton's watch over January's player moves.
Although the Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the potential targets for January's player transfers, he is on guard from the most recruitment-probable, assuring that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In the summer, for future players, there is an adjustment period throughout the preceding period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests retirement.
Swansea's attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he was unable to find new company outside Wales.
The Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's comments.
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later repealed, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was rebuked for admitting to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a momentary impulse," the attacker added, "it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go play Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' deterioration must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy for "ugly victory" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Aces, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick, he managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, which brought them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, be it a trophy or a league that would not also have won games in this way."
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's total increase
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164 000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than that in Great Britain at 5.5%, according to the figures from the National Statistical Institute (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of Britain.
Over these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness the Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention at all, later today I will see a man executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than there are available places, participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through phone calls made over the months and through one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I must not carry a notebook and a pen to save what I have seen.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "could have placed his words better" but still feels that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said so.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants us to have an international journalist on the scene who'll be writing about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I'm not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Tree's murder would, in any case, make him guilty of aiding.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I think he's going to die from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists here who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
He was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer of Canning Vale remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just a few feet from a police officer who tried to "instilt him gently back to the beach".
The police of Canning Vale were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a proper police conference".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the editors tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate his stables last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the editors and Racing Victoria's integrity division for claiming that they have a personal campaign to run against him. On Wednesday the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to her treatment on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue in check on spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like envy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything goes off at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I'm not supposed to be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview on racing.com, where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man... "and I named him when asked... "and offered him a job in my stables if he would pass on information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, it's true they should fire their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moody, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Sundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to non-coachers for what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying here will possibly make them think about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I'm putting pressure on them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-standing Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the day-to-day treatment rule "fellable" after the mud or clay bath has been placed at the feet of a horse, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the competition's grave care, which was the subject of an investigation by the trustees.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was responsible for a traffic escape after hitting a cyclist in Cobram this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after severe injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told us that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals on wrestling claims
At Melbourne Storm, coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team's tackles are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on their own side when it suddenly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach, Wayne Bennett, could barely hide his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final screening. Bennett called the game "the display window" of the rugby league and said that two Queensland teams were not "very enthusiastic" wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on "contact" in the tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was enhanced by two leading coaches' criticisms of Storm, which means they're afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our techniques all year long.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "an exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "stupidly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He thought it important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought out that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play that way.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more point-rich than that between Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense to break and not score?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either against the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available next Tuesday morning.
The Serb Man's $200,000 bail on a drug charge.
A man threatened with life imprisonment for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for $200,000 in bail.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had tracked 100 kilos of drug onto Solay's yacht, which came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic is threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of a quantity of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire quantity and that he could be in a café for totally innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has fixed connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together had offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the sworn testimony of both people, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maximovic on condition that he surrenders his passport to both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police every day and maintains his curfew between 6:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
While the girl was sleeping, Stevan Hogg took her phone and then logged in to an online communication service where Hogg received numerous immoral pictures of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, discovered that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, searched the computers on the scene, and found "careful" online searches using keywords used to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to tempt pedophiles" on the Internet before he "proclaimed to be a cop to scare them".
Mr. Eilidh Robertson of the Fiscal Depute told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that this is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and when Hogg asked him to send them additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he's sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of the rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When she found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying.
Mom saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking pictures of immoral children on 14 June of last year. He violated his bail on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social services had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he'll be in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, the oldest African leader, Mugabe, fell on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video from the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of this Parliament was also marred by the claims of opposition legislators that anonymous death threats had been sent to them warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed him and interrupted him with cry-out while he was giving a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is entitled 'death'," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they stepped out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The supervisor of group discipline said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from its faster growing business equipment and service functions.
The expected job cuts bring with them about $2.7 billion in expenses starting from the fourth quarter, says HP's release.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than $50 billion, and it will "focus on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions" for companies," says the company's press release.
In the 1930s, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates of Stanford University, set up a company to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, known as "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has been undergoing a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Arsenal's Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb draw.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four games in England and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of additional injuries when the player tries to come back through the middle.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has suffered 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played only 65 of Armenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider picture since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Valio League teams who has lost most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their healing of last season's injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when the injury is returned, there may be a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that will happen, and that he will be able to make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday night against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably on the way.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain balance and give the players who need it a break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continuation of the F block, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 matches since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of last season's Champions League against Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first victory over Europe Cup.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how there are no similar descriptions in the series, especially given that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates are higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain and is three times more common among men than among women.
The attempt to tackle the problem was announced by Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) for a year of men in 2015. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 upper secondary school and upper secondary school students who showed depression symptoms. According to the study, a person's ability to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his or her friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half likely to have any mental problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this social media through communication time style goes past content and the immediateity of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, although in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this is at the expense of internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - which affect our deeper mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to examine their emotions completely.
As a volunteer from Samaritans explained to me: "As I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often the men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you get out of trouble, you see it as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide longer-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long - term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're going to come to comedy central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redeployed to celebrate, why don't you take your friends out for coffee in Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö to the side.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against the goals of Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG get past the Swedish team on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the Champions League in her debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several opportunities before finally increasing their head start when Cavan hit the goal at 61.
Paris, which is in Section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because the game was not only an extension but also an improvement in their quarter finals in the last three rounds.
But even though the PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later replaced the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or in the league of champions, so a 2-0 win will create problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and is a good start, even though there are things we have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after his 2-2 tie against Bordeaux at the Ligue 1 home game this weekend, but at the fourth minute he was overshadowed by Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named a man who took the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran behind the Malmö line of defense and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from the PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent who won Celtic's game when he reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in a deep center field.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot at the 34th minute, which went right past Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble because of lost assists and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent along a spiral kick that leaned around Wiland's goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour's game, thanks to Cavan, who scored the sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had hit Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal, which came from the exchange, was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö's coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was December of last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
I don't think we're going to have enough qualifying matches.
I'll put on a hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.

Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced that it had sold some £1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.

Concerns over the long-standing halting of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed by a statement published by the White House on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the opinion.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will arrange a dinner for Xi and her spouse, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Mr Xi will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time enabling President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues with disagreements", was added in the resolution.
With a visit, which was announced for the first time in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet several U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about the alleged cyber espionage of China and the increased conditionality of the country in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
Matt Damon minimizes the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon ran into African-American filmmaker Effie Brown while they were discussing a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
At the HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight episode, an experienced actor interrupted Brown while emphasising the need for different perspectives as regards the dark-skinned main character of the screenplay selected for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when selecting actors for a movie, not a series," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted with unbelief to the injured, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to tell people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore his white pimp hits.
The Dear White People producer demanded that the film be directed to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was posted, the social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clipping, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only dark-skinned person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its publication, Tweeting collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the white police killed a teenage Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter spread over the country and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album of the year candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently issued a statement to answer the question of the Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be considered an hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is part of it among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero, a professional rock climber and vessel collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive the $1 million prize.
The competition programme, which has just finished its seventh term, has never had a competitor who could have survived all the contributions to the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last assignment was to climb about a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and settled the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time who cleared the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. Caldiero, however, solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million prize.
"It's great to think of this when I've never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... so I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finals and why Britten does not receive more reward money, even though he is the first ever competitor to have managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period, which will start shooting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers snuck past the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season has not been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams in the world, but he's now the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played his prankster's role perfectly on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins at 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get a half-way from Houston Astros in a competition for another American League Wild Card place.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter "H" word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they are obtained," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings and then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) bait 6 1/3 in the inning and released three runs.
This was only his third grade in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeman to pitch every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement Victor Martinez hit three times and made possible two runs, which were his first hits since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three - hit night since he hit four Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right hand side, settled down with a one-line tap, and Simon was able to burn down the second-base player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was traded for the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood up to him, Miguel Sana, who was the one who started his first replacement, who pulled a two-chamber run to the left from Drew VerHagen, the right-handed man.
With two runners in the field and a smoothing runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal of a double game.
It was the record of the main series: 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit took the race in the ninth race, Mauer ran two strokes against Tigers' sealer Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in three pitches in his fifth rescue.
Detroit first took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured persons before the game after more than a month due to lower back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I could make a few nice assists with the third inning."
After Hughes caught the starter on first base, he allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to move in one-on-one.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting shift, who took himself to first base with a middle field shot and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 pipe when the runners were in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and cause second run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to move to third base.
Tigers continued in the second inning and received one fire, two in the case of the runner James McCann and two in the case of the second inning, one in the case of the runner Anthony Gosen, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," said Paul Molitor, Team Leader at Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to feed and fed a running third inning, and he was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six hits and a walk for four fires.
ATTENTIONS: Tigers' right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was thrown away by a stretch of the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to a shoulder sprain, but he was due back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are from 1 to 1 in 4 starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to a right crooked abstriations.
Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) who is right-handed in Minnesota.
Xi calls for the wider economy to be opened up to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world for growth," President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday whose task is to guide the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to the deepening of general reform.
Supporting transparency at a time when reforms are being pushed forward with more movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth," said Xi.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take advantage of private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created identifying those sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also relaxes its control over the power it shares with companies, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are opening up to private donors in order to open up government-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cardien", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in a statement published after the meeting.
