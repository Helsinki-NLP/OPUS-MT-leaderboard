The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of approximately 111 000.
The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, with his first major international visit since the May election.

At the top of the debate are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out the essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," said Putin, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whom Kiev and the West claim to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people in the area," Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised me that people came in from early evening.
The number of visitors was expected for two days," says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be a hip-hop festival, so pop is not going to happen, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday a law will enter into force in Finland to restrict the supply of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Department for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, for acceleration.
However, precursors obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rapes between Nairn and Pitlochry.
The accused of rape in two hotels is facing a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a hearing in Glasgow High Court.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "in her unconscious state, in her sleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Court of First Instance.
Champions League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Champions League - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is regarded as the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere when the stronger Liverpool at Mario Balotelli arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's debut was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his top.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of its sixteen pitches to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already been popular with the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotelli in the role of Luis Squarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team sparkled the tip of the middle field diamond Raheem Sterling, instead of Balotelli, who pushed the 3-0 win past the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, not only with its power.
The Englishman 20 cents shorter than Balotelli is between his opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The property is not common to a player who runs at his best on the lawn at a speed of about 40 miles [34 km] per hour.
Rodgers, too, deserves great praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a player more comprehensive than the winger from the north-west of London, who grew up at Wembley's foot.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next Chief conductor of the Helsinki Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have been asking which orchestra he's going to take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells us that she will start her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country's music life for over 100 years, including by performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation, he says.
Administrations of wage-earners' organisations gathered in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karelian
A new impetus is being sought for the pension negotiations today from the social partners' own meetings.
In the morning, the administrations of the SAK, Akava and STTK are discussing the negotiating situation.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Among other things, the social partners have been plagued by the dispute about the retirement age being linked to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would occur this week.
A plier-puss.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team, Woman Volley, stumbled on the League-Professor Vampula athletes at the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned five of the long fights into 3-2 wins.
Last round, WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead of me.
The fight was good, but in defense and passport games the Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
The WoVon fir was in the sense that Jennifer Keddy, a six-foot-old American centirel, had her back stuck on the sidelines.
It was Sara Niemi who played the center.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and with Johanna Pekkarinen formed WoVo's most powerful combination.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema during the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampula was a skilled Russian pastor and Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo circled as much as possible.
WoVo's preparations for the league will continue at the turn of next week when Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 18 o'clock in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet again at the sports academy.
Lidl hammers wild figures in Finland
During the financial year ending at the end of February, the turnover of the company's stores in Finland grew by nearly 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion will continue.
Lidl also reported that nearly EUR 14 million in taxes were paid to Finland during the last financial year.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often fatal in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and complicated access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released this video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Chief researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and when cancer spread more widely at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers a delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment as possible causes.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although teleservice treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance decreases, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, women with ovarian cancer have a poor long - term survival rate regardless of their geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old housewife living in Gold Coast, Eliza Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the sled parking in the Friendship Park, next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the draft station plan of the Friendship Park and its surrounding surroundings will be placed on public view at the service point Osviina.
Statements are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
The city wants to enable the city to continue its snowmobile activities related to tourism in the region.
A park area is to be built to include the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles are proposed for the period from 15 November to 30 April.
Refuelling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and will be valid until spring 2018.
Even loud opposition has been generated by snowmobile parking and change of pattern.
The residents of neighboring blocks of flats have been upset with noise as well as concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and there have been no findings beyond the guide values.
The reformed equipment is also less emission-efficient than in the past.
The park of friendship as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the place of departure was moved further away, the safari pigs in the hotel should be transported to the safari departures by buses estimated to have 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area of the friendship park and the surrounding area are also large enough for the sleds, better than the places presented as replacement points of departure, such as the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location because in the future activities can expand to include the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of a city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, which states that the city's objective is to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobileing in the city centre's partial general plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline of owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden shops
The reduction in the number of home owners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as young consumers today reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age.
According to the Financial Times report, tenants spend only 55% of the money used by homeowners in gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings without gardens, and the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved with parking space, and these factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated to be worth about GBP 5 billion a year.
In London's major area, property ownership has fallen from 61 to 43 percent in six years, where gardening is the country's country with the least money per household.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in the rent of dwellings or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that humans cannot grow plants.
According to RHS' leading garden advisor Guy Barter, "for example, plants grown in mobile breeding vessels are particularly popular among tenants, since such breeding vessels can be included in the move if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming period for the resale of the garden sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey is interrogating a U.S. diplomat about a spy report.
The Turkish State Department has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on the American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US embassy administrator and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden from the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy for US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the significance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the espionage of Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service brought about a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actor in several successful films, has been attached to the leading female in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Kuparinen's film 2 nights into the morning, which starts filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won Cannes' Best Woman's Prize for her role in the Barbarian invasion in 2003.
He has performed, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly's glass dome.
The leading man in 2 nights to morning film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will have its premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The complainants provided evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the City Council of Calvià at the District Attorney's Office in Mallorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvià, located on Mallorca Holiday Island, has been arrested for damp celebrations as a result of allegations of corruption made by shop owners and bar owners in the well-known Magaluf area.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several owners of Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. The Punta Ballena Street is home to most of Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who reported evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the City Council of Calvià at the Office of the Prosecutor's Office for the Prevention of Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
The other two local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The country's daily newspaper ABC wrote about the anger of nightclub owners over the partiality of the authorities, which significantly complicated their business.
"It's not money anymore, it's survival," one shop owner said to the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was headlined in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf vacationers by reducing the number of participants in infamous, alcoholic pub crawlies.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the club owner and pub crawl organiser Carnage were jointly fined EUR 55 000.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination in Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called ‘balconing' trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombed their communities during the 50 - day Israeli - Hamas war, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket - bombed communities in southern Israel, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod in Pashosh, employees removed fragments from the walls and slided before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We're a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children in this area are in desperate need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, feels that going back to school after a long time is a bit weird.
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the end of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people from border communities such as Saad had either stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are sceptical about the return of the Palestinian grenade after the killing of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children" would be ensured.
Israel and Hamas agreed an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not provide a solution to a number of key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
Egypt is expecting the start of a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although they did not have solid proof of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers shot 4,591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still protected and fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the week before.
"I hope that the school will soon open and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, housing prices have risen most in seven years during Australia's winter months.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures the prices of dwellings in Australia's capital city, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, was shown by RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose in June, July and August to a total of 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to RP Data's research director, Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
RP Data results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is now the busiest; the average price increase is between 5 % and 6 %.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in the sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally high pace of sales and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in the prices of dwellings will continue over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's Fine Arts Weeks told me that on Monday they had made a guest record after 14 500 people had visited the Waiting Event this summer.
These figures have not been used to.
People have stopped at doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums will reach 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40 000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11 000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in the last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, a break-in of a window broke into a commercial property on Northrow.
The unsub had a small amount of money on his way out of the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, there was fuel stolen from the truck tank on Deep Enonkatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, a boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the boatport of the betraying neck.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, it said "OVA" on the nose.
A couple of suspects were already caught by the cops.
On Sunday night on the Tikkapurontie, a business property was broken into.
The police dog got a print and a 20-year-old paltamoman was found in the woods hiding under a tree.
On Monday the police captured another man in Paltamo who was also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamines brought a murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a man in Kajaan who was born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot the owner of an apartment he suspected to be a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car where a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu District Court will pass judgment later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August is repeated once every ten years on average.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most countries the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when he was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and has been developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The audio track is a mix of reggae and rap at upbeat speeds.
Henry's been going through some painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy many times since her mother died, and she ponders much about her relationship with her father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer sheath or the beauty of cricket.
I never spoke to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal foundry in Dudley, thus getting an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
The melting plants are a little brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthal depths, with flames, smoke, and soot that remind you of hell.
Father used to go for a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing by himself as he washed the sewage from himself.
As I walked around the melting house, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the intimacy of his parents.
My father never hugged me or said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother began to get sick a little before she died that we began to keep telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter named Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love that she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying, "I love you"?
Stop huggin' me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mother's death.
When I began to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult —
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is absorbed in making a theatre.
Next came the Comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making the theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy Henry has been doing all through his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only 16 years old, a factory worker.
A Dictator spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time I was the only black imitator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was doing his job.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to make jokes on a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living in stardom and on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never taken part in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and repugnant, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where he made fun and admired black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on commercials, documents, TV shows and film parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series in 2008 at the BBC, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just pedaling in your place or on the side tracks."
Next up was the Radio 4 Channel documentary series "What's So Great About?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, which wears tights and has money.
That's why I was so scared about Shakespeare.
Everyone we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You date words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt as if a part of me had been missing in the past, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but not quite so.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the leading role in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly, I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
On one occasion the play had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You'll have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation will continue as soon as the problem has been resolved.
I walked out of the stage, and a part of me sighed of relief.
It's not my responsibility.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines to the Fences play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This, of course, is what Henry says with a KUMMALY voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: our conversation is constantly interrupted by small pups of humor as he trades between impressions.
Abstention from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, because getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it could lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel that way, but generally it doesn't inspire me the way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with a director who will help shape the beginning, middle stage and end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
I keep telling a story when I'm playing, and I like to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the Government's notice indicated.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars were spent a month on the wages and other financial abuses of 'ghost workers'.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after the person has died or has left his duties as civil servants, Wanyama Chebusiri from the BBC reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the identification centres over the next few weeks to ensure that their data are recorded in biometric form, as indicated in the Government's notice.
According to the press release, any person who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector because it defines how many people actually work in their duties, and it also clears pay lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official at the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki's profit for the financial year 2015 may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic climate.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is reaching a deficit of around 9.4 million.
Possible ways of enhancing efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services, purchase of services, sale of property and grants, and increase revenue from taxes and payments.
The EUR 10 million cut-off target for investment amounts to EUR 8.5 million.
There's no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the inadequate increase in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in state contributions further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the goal of the strategy," says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals made to the management team for preparation.
The proposals made by the City Board will form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal progresses through board processing to the City Council and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "an anti-government plot", reports local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale criminal gang and tracking telephones.
Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at that time) said that police action was part of the planned action by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held at every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at the Slavianski school where Yatsenyuk's daughter visits, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's scribed shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry, Texas, the abusive tweet was trespassing.
On Sunday evening, a reviling picture of a Democratic district attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas during the hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent illegally from my account.
"I do not accept tweet and I have deleted it," said a later publication.
Perry's backup team did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first tweet contained a slanderous cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the Tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as high as I can... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge in charge to reject the charges and said that the law under which the governor in Texas's longest office is accused is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led to a formal complaint from a left-wing follow-up group.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After gaining fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing a picture of himself on Twitter running around the lake with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important developers has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital, London, has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases, while the widespread credit bubble has been feared, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-level developer Berkeley, said that "since the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since the peak of 2013" and added that this has allowed a "stable operating environment".
During the recession, the housing market in London went well as foreign investors sought out a herd of capital.
According to land registry data, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent just the previous year, well above the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by around one fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of GBP 423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate a less attractive destination in recent months - the interest of some has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric on the possible "tasket tax" before the May general election.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending provisions, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The latest data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its forecast for 2015 from London real estate prices. According to this, prices are falling by three per cent because the index of household owners' views on prices has already started to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by one quarter to one year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right product in its best position has remained stable and therefore sales have remained high".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the previous year, almost a third more than at the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent to one year ago, resulting in GBP 380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1,6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley reported that Berkeley's annual earnings were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold at a steady price of £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold photos of a hundred other stars leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures online.
A star star-hunting representative confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "an insolent violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures will be charged.
The images originally published on the 4chan image release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other hacking stars is claimed to be dozens of other female stars, as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
We don't know how much of the photos are real, though Scott Pilgrim versus World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
But Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called naked pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand?"
Let me finish this in the beginning.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only we have an extract of Howard Jacobson's praise for the new novel on love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, it was the best description of what happened, and gradually they came apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only once in a while did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, too hard, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was thorny, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had been in an early relationship, yet it had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have helped his loneliness and perhaps even brought some substance to his life.
Ailin Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyous heart, from a northern village that was even more harsh and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion who Kevern assumed to be his aunt. She had inherited a house in a damp but paradisaic valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, snails had left their mark on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, weeds were growing in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Reported by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm afternoon in the spring, both listening to a scattering receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news when the cross - crossed sun - brown feet of Ailinn reminded Kevern of a song that had long since been sung by a forgotten black performer and that his father had often listened to the shades of the cottage below.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They had not been banned — nothing was actually banned — but they were no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, as did the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion did not achieve what the laws and decrees had not achieved: just as in literature people chose heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances to read, they preferred ballads in music.
Wildened by the day, Kevern began to dial the imaginary piano and sing serenadia to the big Ailinni's feet with an arrogantly comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word that starts with a j out of your mouth and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one "if" word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become known to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each part of it was grateful — thankfully, for having been saved as if they had been saved by luck — by the principle that each group did the things that were natural to it.
Based on their Temperament and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean genealogy are best suited to entertain and exercise, so they sang and ran.
Originally, people from the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was up to them to make sure that every family had a working telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those remaining from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When what I did, IF IT happened, those from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of burning flames and fearing that the flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning water pipe, and continued their lives with their eyes on the ground created and bored.
Let each man act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could ever be dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big-footeds.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but an abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage head leaves.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought she was weird already.
"My dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailin shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered the field of vision of Kevern.
Nothing to see in the whole world except the huge, crow-black hairbrush of Ailin.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't exactly big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too soon for that.
"I find you attractive because of your fat ankles," she tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He'd wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailin Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the flowers, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like a palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what attracts me to you twistedly," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words, and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailin decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had basically been like life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paleer and devilisher than their smuggler and scattering parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver — suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, for the sucking in itself was already hostile.
Ailin Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window — a man who was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten and lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution that measured public opinion in Ofnow, did a short study on the continuation of low and medium-level violence in areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, of violence was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A great deal has already been done, and much still remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggression of a people who fought for thousands of years and who most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote parts where, despite the church towers over the hedges, humanity has rarely been known over time.
Some things, however, cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its impulses.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour the stories of overcome hardships and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, the old-fashioned cruelty holds persistently in its grip on both rural communities and urban community areas, and there is evidence of a new, evil-souled fight in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to her right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm opposed to atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open - minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectful in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil - souledness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
To say what happened, if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, will destroy the earth's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-pink LED light proclaimed a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, value your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure that her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SILEN'S what happened if it happened.
True, this time we do not pour out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz, with his fingers, formed a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "as you describe as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far to say that they poured out their 'hate and distrust'."
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'the others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that it has behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, be it good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk about this – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way of making them.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and indicated that Esme was about to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle driver on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil and fierce".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho's army denies planning the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied that they had staged a blow to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The Head of State and his family travelled to neighbouring South Africa after telling us that he was threatened with death.
The military representative, Major Ntle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army responded in this way to the threat of "political fanatics".
"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, president of the South African Government, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"Even though no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces seem to be fully in line with the signs of a revolution," he says.
According to Lesotho's army officials, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended Parliamentary sittings due to disagreements between the large coalition government.
He thus denies his underestimation of government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft establishes a data centre in New Zealand
Microsoft, an IT company, has set up a large data center in a location in Uusimaa where the company does not agree to specify its location.
Microsoft's press release to the media states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been put at the centre.
Microsoft will complete its Oulu office, which will take the job away from about 500 people.
In all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's Communications Director, says to STT that the company does not comment on the number of employees employed by the new data center.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data centre in New Zealand.

Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have several different devices to choose from.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I personally took these pictures at the family feast using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules worth following.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproofly closed.
In addition, set camera description settings to match images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video cameras have a setting that optimises underwater imaging conditions.
In addition – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 feet, others can withstand 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for branching, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will decrease significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target so that the object fills the whole picture up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protestors swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically gives Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kongs.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that the general nomination of the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
From 1997 onwards, when Great Britain handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be free to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is governed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the functioning of the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement would enter a new era of civil disobedience and would generate protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, apparently they did not give details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online newsletter, the organisers said that the movement "considers Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the conquest of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, anxiety is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of people from the continent has created competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's survival — the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts," says regina Ip, legislator, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want any concern to spread that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the minions of the Western powers that fuel revolution".
This summer, activists organised an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
The American prom tradition strikes British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to respond to demand by establishing Britain's first luxury form of travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable entry to the university.
Stewart says there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and highest quality transportation to the university.
According to the company's representative, no reservations have yet arrived because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start ordering over the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 a year.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the university section of the organisation, "this service plan seems to be a long way from the life of the student majority".
Many this month's studies begin with a shock at the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge increase in basic living costs. Only next thing you can start to think about where to find thousands to be used for something as simple as getting to campus.

Real estate agents removed the image of a house for sale in Suffolk when they discovered that a large pig is lying in the house's living room.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located along a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned on the couch.
According to Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the picture ended up in the advertisement by mistake and has since been deleted," says the company's representative.
In the ad, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although real estate has removed the image from its website, it is still displayed in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where questions have been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

National protest by Bulgarian prison staff
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria demonstrated themselves before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
At a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
The salary increases are also to be discussed with Hristo Ivanov, temporary Minister of Justice.

Negotiations are currently taking place, Mr Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers' association is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior's trade union.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted into the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his rosy-black US match, and he beat the bloods of the second half of Ukraine with his stopping solutions.
But Salin passed all the credit on to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost passed out at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In his eyes, it was blurry. There was nothing he could do.
The noise and the white audience sea were almost too much for me.
The power moments of the hall contained nine pins in a fast pace, ball-thickness, disks, and tangled everywhere that happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode like that that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that the others caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so no wonder his example raised the entire team to a flight that was too much for the big, hard-handed Ukraine's five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous game of the jury was a blasphemous one.
Heikki Montonen (right) who carried the bag was Finland's main coach at the Argentina World Cup in 1982.
32 years have passed since the last time the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as it was yesterday: it was a hot fight against France in the primary segment.
"In the game's award balls, the judge's game was glaring," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
All of a sudden, the game went on.
We lost 2-3, and after that the pasmas went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world's selections, as the Polish World Cup is starting today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster than ever," said Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to go from the primary lobe to the extension.
Then it might be tight," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory match against Tunisia.
Current player Agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope we're up to 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Genre legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening worship at Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme at the World Cup in 1982.

Competition moments always leave great memories," says Immonen.
Finnish tourists rescued Cita from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the praise"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen looked for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure it and pull it a little bit forward, but its legs didn't just carry it," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help came from the police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
By nightfall, things were beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers were present who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and Tuomo of his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway in Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon a German man came along with a mattress.
The mattress gave Cita the kind of gurneys they put the injured dog on.
The German man came after us a while after we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while," Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of an expedition mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreached.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
The night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They'd had some happy news from Mikkelsen. They said that Cita was feeling better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In reality, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT), which means a host of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which had a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he was going to be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before reaching the age of 30.
Now a 51-year-old mother of two says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day, and everything took me longer than everyone else.
I could never skate or skateboard with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers that said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicky.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by 18 years of age and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my full capacity.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the time he was 17 years old, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was lucky," he says.
Charity CMT UK - organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred immigrants were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
Smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were going, where they were coming from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a publicist at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, migrants had paid around EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece and an additional EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel extensively through a couple of million inhabitants of Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Already three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scotland's independence
The pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scotland's independence.
According to Guardian magazine, in a couple of weeks the bands will star at a concert in Edinburgh to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scotland's independence will take place on 18 September.
In his press release, Mogwai said that the vote is an opportunity for the Scottish people, which only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, among other things, actor Sean Connery has given his support to independence.
Instead, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to Scottish people to remain part of Britain.
In the Gallup, the supporters of independence have been defeated.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's 3rd reactor is completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima TVO.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach property to Bottas - worth about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated to Valtteri Bottas, a format driver, 1.4 hectares of beach property on the shore of Kärkjärvi in Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sports and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no gravel noise at the meeting when the property was decided on," says Mayor Pauli Syarakki.
Bottas' gift plot has seven farm buildings.
The municipality will dismantle them this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a free-time residence on the property within two years.
We are impressed that he has enjoyed his birthplace and will continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
And hopefully it will continue to be, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the bank property to be worth EUR 40,000 to 60,000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has, with varying success, been using gift plots to keep people successful in sports in the municipality.
The world champion Aki Parviainen and Aerobick's world champion Tuuli Matinsalo received home plots from the municipality and built the funky detached houses.
Instead of staying in Nastola, however, they sold their properties and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then changed their lives when things changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola, and his situation is different, Syaraki inches and believes that Bottas will remain in his municipality of residence.
Hull hired the attacker with a record sum of Hernandez's company.
The Champion League Club Hull invested the club's record sum in the purchase of Abel Hernandez, a member of the Uruguayan national team.
Hernandez will exchange the Italian club for Hull from Palermo for £9.5 million, i.e. around €12 million.
It's a three-year deal.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and went to Italy's main series.
In the Uruguay national team, he's scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez entered the field in two matches.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also told me that he had acquired Senegal's national team captain at Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
The Russian space experiment failed. The geckos sent on a sex trip died.
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos traveled on a Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
For example, little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geckos' eggs.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on a person while he resided in a space similar to the longer periods of time, as illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or causes of death of geckos are determined.
According to Interfax, passengers who were described as "sex geckos" were frozen.
The surprise is also the fact that the fruit flies that traveled with the same Foton-M4 were able to survive the trip without difficulty, and they also had offspring.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at the airport in Nice
France arrested a suspected terrorist at the airport of Nice on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him down after he used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and then cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted her father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already followed the man's actions.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalising young people who lured Iraq or Syria into wars also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those registered in France have travelled to Syria, returned from Syria or are currently planning to go to Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The basketball team's hopes for an extension are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in its second World Cup match today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine will be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the extension site.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, in his first match, Ukraine struck the Dominican Republic between 72 and 62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion from three years ago.
The Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played them before, and we have to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's defeat for the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can assure you that there will be a regular pack of wolves on the field, Möttölä said.
The alleged naked images of Hollywood stars are spreading online - part confirmed authentic
There are a number of naked images on the Internet that are claimed to be known public figures.
Among other things, the actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked image" campaign.
The entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures (on the Internet) will be prosecuted, the representatives will threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that are spreading about her are genuine.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy trouble was for this.
I feel sorry for everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes by site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls images under her own name faked.
There are also genuine or fake naked pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalie criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the betting league.
The comments made by goaltender Walter Viitala after the Sunday VPS match describe the confusion of the club's current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," said Viitala after the battle that ended with the 1-2 loss.
In the first half of the game, Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes.
The goaltender Viitala wasn't happy with bad defensive play.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and therefore defenders in front of the Viitala have also changed rapidly.
With the gamer roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala snorted without naming a single player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"After the game I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that it is not possible to expect immediate success from players when the players are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially when you're on the defensive, you've changed people.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo with TPS, the second last TPS in the squares.
There are still seven rounds of betting leagues left, so the Espoos still have time to avoid falling into Number One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna do it now.
We are certainly not going to fall out of this series," says the goalie Viitala.
Lars von Trier doing a television series after decades of break

Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his tumultuous media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series to television.

I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the Super Popular Challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
Video has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The perspective of wolf howling (even): How can you explain the increase in fan numbers?
I was feeling really good today.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland had played against France in the football hall in Marouss, Athens.
I didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who cried out to the empty hall of 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraina World Cup?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the number of Finnish fans.
The European Championships in 1995 were a search time for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning the Russian qualifier at the Helsinki Sports House, among other things.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölä's lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from a distance, even though things didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team went deep.
There were reportedly just over 100 Finns present at the Athens Games.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
In Bilbao there are journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can tell me the exact figure of the Finnish tournament tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
No matter what the number is between here and there, it's an incomprehensible amount.
There's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global world economy, companies are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys thrive in the world," says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Certainly there are Finns in both Spain and the volleyball World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
But it still doesn't explain everything.
You have to be attracted to sports yourself.
Itkonen brings sport into popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports games than Berlin to watch art.
But without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and even players to throw themselves into top-of-the-line sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team was put on a pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top-class sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
That's when the audience gets interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can ball sports also pass this massive interest into domestic series?
On average, hundreds or slightly over 1,000 spectators are played in basketball and volleyball.
Itkonen considers the question to be good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
Another school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of double interest.
It's a challenge for companion people in the middle of a rush.
On the Bottas property, confirmation - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards the formula driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach property.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
There will be a free-time residence on the property in the future.
In Nastola we have been watching Bottas' success since his karting days.
He's seen as a good ambassador to market Lahte, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiska, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, from which the municipality will disassemble six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas won formula 1 in the Belgian round this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähde for his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design-smart clothes come, but hardly for the poor.
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball people in the field, but also by the top amateur of college players, Marcus Giron.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mop on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
Before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine, the mokkula, which acts as a central unit, is removed.
The fashion house has not given us an exact time to start selling the shirt, nor did it even suggest the price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos of California has brought out a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece, and the central unit the size of their thumbs costs $200.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technology.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later classes borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling the books right away.
"My book of mathematics would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use throughout the semester and a fat sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder says that his books from last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying far less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with over 250 campus book stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of university booksellers' books during the past spring were rental books," says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, you can only get a new book for a third of what it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but Chegg.com's book is available for $23.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used from Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's senior student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, reports that he has bought the book "Strategic Media Desions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used in Amazon.com online store only for $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, head of Amherst's College Without Walls, University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reform of the new edition is not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon Bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save over 80 percent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, the use and wear of the highlight pen.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented out to the holder of the e-book, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store gives you the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, which option they choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon begin Pepperdine's law school, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to determine the price, because it will make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock," says Gault.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at full cost at the university bookstore.

Almost twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year almost twice as many people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
Last year there were 31 fire deaths in the corresponding period.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organisation's fire deaths statistics, the last worse situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in dwellings.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety review at home.
At least all smoke detectors in the home should be verified according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is readily available for use.
There must also be an accessible way out of all areas of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use while at home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport in an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall at the so-called countersummary.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protestors who had even arrived from Belgium.
Youths were rescued by air from the blue mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after a night stuck in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party made up of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the duo was found around 11:00 near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were raised to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have been fiercely engaged with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army representative, the opposing gunfire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, the Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery shots yesterday off the coast of South-East Ukraine sank this morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard didn't know where the ship was fired from.
The Separatists told me yesterday that they shot the ship in the social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Mr Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions," Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets were flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen when heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars in their undersides.
On Sunday the authorities estimated that it might take a while to ease the flood, even though it was predicted that the rains would stop by Monday.
The heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance about the rains.
The Finnish Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who was on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that affected the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Mr Valls called on a deeply divided left to "show his feelings" for a socialist president in difficulty whose composition of the new government did not win the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"It's our job to stay by his side," said Valls, and deserved a round of applause.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave France's controversial 35-hour working week in peace, despite the suggestion made earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused disunity by appearing at a meeting of the socialist parliamentarians who expressed differing opinions and by criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the constant discord between socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government in Valls would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to the war, but so has Manuel Valls, who had a duty to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the journalists.
He repeated his party's suggestion of disbanding the parliament and held the party's election victory in the early elections, and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the extreme right held the list tip in the May EU elections.
According to a poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government managed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realise that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Moira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka failed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Good morning Finland published a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
With the video hosted by Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record good morning Finnish advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording is not going to go quite straight.
Alm-Sira is going crazy when he tries to say the word budget rifling, and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose their nerve time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow," says Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo office, was ranked third in a series of potrets in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held at the House of Building Masters in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to picture.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
You can see from the look of Meir that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of known persons or events.
It is great that other images can be successful today as long as there is an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall shot from the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation already cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the drugs unit of the Helsinki police has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his dissertation in information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and legal proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system whereby the data collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The doctoral dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was left on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special bulletin on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Trip School caused food noise in social media," says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable alternative!
This is stated in a 15 - year - old bulletin that has been left on the school wall.
You can take a look here.
The image spread in social media has led people to send the Pirkkala municipality indignant feedback.
Arja Vaarma, head of the Food and Cleaning Service, says to Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there has been a thought of this kind that has been discussed with health care in its time.
Every student gets the meal he wants," he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or nurse on a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people's vegetarian experiments may leave their diet inadequate and the lack of meat or chicken may be surprising to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
With this transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources suggest that information on a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names in the public domain because there is no public consultation.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when it amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceanian and Regent brands, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies in the coming years, such as the middle classes of China and India.
Companies compete to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 transaction, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current composition in 2000 following its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is Lim Kok Thay's entertainment and casino company, a Malaysian billionaire.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting's share of the company was 28 %, Apollo's 20 % and the private equity company TPG Capital LP's 8 % from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have a combined share of 82 % of the cruise capacity in North America, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise on the issue of shares.
The City Board of Tampere is working on this today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will support the initiative firmly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, there is a need to close the Dolphinariums in Finland and around the world as a matter of urgency.
Fortunately, in recent years there has been a widespread view around the world that the holding of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither protective nor ethical.
This view should also be borne by Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
The death of Nasi-delphine strengthens the requirements for the liquidation of the dolphinry.
The death of Nasis is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium in Särkanniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, to close down the dolphin prison and to find out how to move Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, to a sort of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
You did not have time to return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Särkänniemi will have time to experience more life than a unstimulated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Protection Federation of Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal welfare law under preparation.
This includes the dolphins.
In support of this request, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara is taking part in today's demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with Eastern Ukraine
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state-like" of the region, Russia's news sources report.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukraine region ruled by the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would need to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their rights and interests.
Putin's request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which will allow it to head for Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to recapture the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, controlled by the separatists, which was taken over by the separatists in March and April following Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region into a "Novorist", a "New Russia" – this term resembles the days of glory before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks were an illusion as long as Ukrainian politicians were campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces were attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We need to start extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the South-East Ukraine State, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to greater independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in its efforts to alleviate the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need," says Peskov.
There can be no discussion on this issue between Ukraine and Russia," says Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine".
The interim remark by the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct the 'false interpretation' of Putin's comments, underlined that the Russian regime is dealing with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, in which case it practically took over an area of which the majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power over the region that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial seaports and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the Russian region between Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, in his inaugural speech, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions that are not part of Ukraine's core territory in terms of their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and fuelled by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Azov coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the taking over of the city of Novoazovsky by the separatists supported by Russia will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to massive reinforcement of Mariupol city by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, a half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Pooshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to reach a point where there's no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any direct action decisions; the leaders proposed further sanctions to be imposed if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the area of Ilovaisk following the transfer of two Russian armored units and 1 000 soldiers to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by the Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
At the second half, Sulley Muntar was hit first and a little later, Jeremy Menez was hit by the penalty kick.

Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the twist of the naked scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's outraged by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood's A-list star Gabi Grecko's naked pictures.
In the entertainment world, a number of Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures were released on the Internet as a result of a wide - range celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 naked pictures of Hunger Star Lawrence and other superstars like Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York reported commenting on the case in an online magazine "excruciating" and saying that victims "feel disgraced".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer at the topless pool edge.
Palmer's movie rewards include, among other things, the film Love and Honor with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck's star Strahovsky and Sucker Punch actor Browning didn't comment on the hacked photos last night.
Lawrence's representative said to TMZ that "it is an insolent violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen became angry with a hacker in his tweet: "The publication of stolen images from a mobile phone is no different from the sale of a stolen product".
