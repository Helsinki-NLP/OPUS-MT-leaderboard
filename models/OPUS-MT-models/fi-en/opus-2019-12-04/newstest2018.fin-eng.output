Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making art about the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the project room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a long story about how outside people have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided on his behalf who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my individual treatment history so that the violence of the process could become visible," says Auer.
With the process, he refers to the process of sexual repair.
It is often a long-term research period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a "gender identity disorder" referral to the diagnosis studies that will be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the Internet and was already well advanced in his own repair process.
He felt like a woman, but according to Finnish law a person has to go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translaw (563 / 2002) requires transgender people to be forced into a forced sterilisation so that the right sex can be obtained, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
At the moment, all sexual repairers are required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive infertility.
You have the right to decide on your own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and there is a preliminary ruling before the European Court of Human Rights which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their sovereignty.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the leadership of the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election and the True Finns rose to the government.
Now the legal amendment is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes which do not even relate to this law.
"The Board of Directors does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the Board regarding the amendment of the Act," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist at the University of Tampere hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report on this basis which would define the treatment and assistance of Auer.
The sense of the reality of the study is shown to be vulnerable to instability.
The subject's perception of himself appears fragmented on a borderline level and the destabilising features of personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," says Auer.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given sex-corrected treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were insufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the TV out of the transpol waiting room.
Later on, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Exclusive, in which Auer reflexes his experience of power and its use.
"It is crazy that any person who is about to become a woman can magnify his breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove his breasts," says Auer.
Your body will not be yours if you feel like you are anything other than the amount of your gender that is defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
The gender correction process is harder for many for spiritual reasons than for purely medical operations.
The people who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified on their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy for people who need support and help to be denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not sufficient," says Auer.
Many people who have applied for a process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential experience of bullying.
On this basis, the medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing treatment and assistance can put people in an even worse situation than it was before the process started," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts all my adult life and that's what people usually find hard to digest."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier for her to feel better.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and in teenagers.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit in your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels he's already being seen, he exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of the close ones could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you are abusing you.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
But not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, a conflict of the body in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, there can be no formal confirmation of their gender.
"There is no medical justification for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination as regards legal sex.
A full-time applicant makes a written application for a new identity card stating that he or she is of another sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms his or her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new identification number.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also crystallised by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still holds weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Association issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The National Association for Citizens' Rights of Afro-Americans (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks that took place there.
"The travel bulletin for the NAACP Mission in Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been a number of questionable racial events."
The law recently entered into force in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to the courts, and the implementation of state law is disproportionately targeted at minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of skin colour and abused or killed, "said Rod Chapel, Chairman of the NaACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of one case in so short a time."
The travel data sheet for Missouri is the first US state warning issued by the organisation.
The organisation mentioned as examples racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and he was arrested by the Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a report by the Missouri Minister of Justice that the police are more likely to stop a black driver than a white man.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to encourage people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"People need to prepare themselves, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which is the sixteenth largest in the US states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
Recently, the ACLU for civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following their adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration offences, which, according to the organisation, will increase racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently they have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (middle), Minister for Economic Affairs, responsible for State Ownership Management, has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension payment received by the airline's managing director Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, it contradicts the expression of the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Vauramo was raised this week as Helsingin Sanomat reported on the performance of the directors of listed companies.
Finnish Kuvaleti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would abandon supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has aligned that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's policy decision on ownership control.
The sanctions were immediately harming the talk.
Until recently, it appeared that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, seemed to be getting along perfectly well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with a bitter reaction in Russia.
The most shocking response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who says that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a 'full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions are only written off as political rhetoric and excesses, it is a fact of tension between the United States and Russia after a short honeymoon following Trump's election.
In the United States, the passing through of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress adopted the law with considerable consensus, the adoption of the law was much more difficult for the President, according to the narrative.
Mr Trump therefore criticised the law which he had recently signed as "significantly deficient."
President Trump's distrust must have been due in particular to Russia, even though the adoption of the law restricting its own powers must have been repulsive.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States of Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign on Russian connections.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
When the staff of the White House have changed tight and the various scandalous developments have almost been updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is certainly not desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a kimurant in the United States, then the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is also intensifying relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the whole, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State with a great deal of trade with Russia such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly the Fennovo nuclear power plant project may have effects.
Acidification in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy, has been excluded from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights.
Attacking the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as the others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists in the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with Jim Acosta on CNN. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in the verbatim of the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge crowds of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the importance of the statue and, in particular, the fact that in 1903 a poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the statue - 17 years after the statue was completed.
"I don't want to go further into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of the American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem was added later, and it does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
The essential words are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor," "Your huddled masses you learn to breathe free," / "The watched refuse of your theming shop."
The poem is more topical now than ever.
He made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" were not welcome in the United States of Trump.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of the wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to the base of the statue, and they knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American republicism through a classic metaphor, the feminine incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the banished.
Attaching the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationality mark.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh - a mouthpiece that can now be seen as some kind of sign of Trump - claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives, leading the American torch into the world of darkness: "Lady Liberty comes forth.
He's taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch will not lead the way to the United States. "
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and weary but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and staggering journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want under any circumstances.
Their torches do not lead the way, but fuel the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Sports Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made it to the British national team.
Neil Black, the result leader of the British Federation of Universal Sports, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "a significant confirmation."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Sports Championships starting in London on Friday.
In Scotland, he said, "something special is happening," which British sports must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what this is all about," says Black.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute for Sport and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
On the other hand, the Scottish Federation believes that it has something to do with its activities,
and the British Federation of Universal Sports believes that their activities are behind them.
And a common street man thinks he's got something to do with it.
However, it is something quite wonderful, whatever it is. "
Many Scottish athletes in London are seriously competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchard, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5 000-metre run. Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
The words of Eilidh had a real feeling and passion for sport. "
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championships in a 400-metre fence run, and these are his fifth World Championships, and he thinks it's "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, the midway runner, has run five British and two European records in the course of the year.
He's competing in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season with profits in the UK World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championships, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is so proud that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
"Being a captain is a great honour, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes who compete for the awards.
My captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home-run contest.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing. "
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics, always for his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as dumb and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," said Washington in 1783.
That brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The United States League of Civil Rights sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge to be unfounded and the attitude was also understated online.
"Who cares? This is just Facebook," a lot of people commented.
But it matters.
Especially in the Hogan case.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of a state ruled by democrats.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not very responsive to the hothead.
He has been a stable leader of the state and a firm adherence to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of the bald head in chemotherapy.
That is why blocking users who come to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax money.
The spokesman for Hogan, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, and she said it was just a question of modulating comments.
However, stigmatising commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
Washington Post interviewed users Hogan stopped on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and appropriate.
The Reverend borrowed the Bible in his communiqué; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile, but asked about hate crimes.
"I politely comment that I am disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in his comments on the Washington Post news.
"Nor can I accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as some sort of organized group and ignored the citizens concerned as a large group."
The governor's staff called it a "centralised attack," someone else might call them "to promote things that are considered important."
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers in which critical editorials had been published, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
However, the real issue is the same, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
The Twitter users that President Trump prevented have sued him.
The first major decision on this subject was taken last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, judge of Alexandria District Court, the Loudoun County Government violated the first amendment of the United States Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the United States League of Civil Rights went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal charges had the same effect as today's Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and the anonymous authors were beating Washington.
There were trolls back then.
Mr Juricola, Mr Valerius, Mr Belisarius and Mr Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they called on Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticising Jay's agreement, the agreement between the United States and Britain on cooperation, trade and shipping, as illustrated by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are fundamental elements of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen locations, plus online reports of a couple or three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then the individual from Haapavee and Seinäjoki, the specialist Marja Isomursu from Evira says.
The green finches are dead from a glitter called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to strike pigeons in the past, especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected by finch birds.
In 2009, there was a big bang.
At that time, tricromonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch stock, and since then, stocks of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, the museum master of the University of Helsinki's Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
The fear is that the last epidemic of green finches will recur again if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple matter that can be done by everyone: to stop feeding birds in summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home-field advantage at the Renaissance Club
The former European number one player, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian holds the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament on the next-door Archerfield Links, before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new place and works as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event brings it to its fullest glory," says Rafferty.
"Players can see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a keen ambassador to the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
Tournament is a great showcase for this field. "
The English Eales champion the championship for the first time, although they have won both the European tour and the European challenger tour in their 32-year career.
"This seems like a really special opportunity," says the player who lives in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my victory over the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament victory was great for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember. "
Gary Orr is back in business on his own soil, and he went on tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home area is always more relevant," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far. "
The trident will be accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots participate: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Parking the car costs £5 if the car only has a driver, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK Cancer Association.
In Säkylä, the barracks were working on possible indoor air problems.
In Säkylä, at least for the time being, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of Pori's brigade, the brigade was announced on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The investigation began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there are no problems with the health situation of other military personnel.
It became clear that this was an isolated case and that no other person serving in that service had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in detail.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem, "says Holma.
The brigadier's press release states that due to the arrival of July, goods must have been transferred to the barracks, which may have caused a momentary increase in dustiness.
The air may therefore have seemed stuffy, "says Holma.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold land
Bardina Degei does not use stove in cooking.
Even the kettle is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato - locally "nota" - in the fireplace.
In half an hour, a sweet potato burned to the ground will be devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home. He sits on a muddy painting where he usually also does his daily chores, such as washing in the cloudy water collected from the nearby swamp.
The toilet is served by a bucket in a roof-free room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husband, and has not been ordered to take care of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, many drink a lot, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"Nobody dares to walk in the village after 5: 00 in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peeking in the everyday highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which the 1 026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch regime, quickly turned its wrath on the Jakarta government, which controls the region strictly and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and coarse. The journey there starts on an hour and a half flight from the province's capital of Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive from the stomach to the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
There are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences in the city of about 19,000 inhabitants, the rust of which has been dyed yellow with corrugated roofs.
Few Indonesian have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, the Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshipped Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrap head, dark skirt and bright-colored blouse.
"We used to only have leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold land.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants, and only about 100 km from Paniainen is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the stifling presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and local military units between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150 000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papayans and has raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of the Papua Tribes took place in the 1970s to the extent of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
The 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We Will Loss Everything," contains reports of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods - and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the Indonesian populace from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi moves to the region in the hope of a better livelihood for Muslims.
The Japanese warung food stands sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than the locals," says the 24-year-old Abed You, who is from Pania and moved to the province capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, the President of Indonesia, either Widodo - nicknamed Jokowi - promised to address the injustice and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to the Presidential Castle of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," says You.
Panies experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remark, but according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and abused them with a rifle shot.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission was set on fire and the next day started to happen.
About a thousand Papuans - young men and women and children - gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They had with them hunting springs for the festivities, and they started performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in the ring and simulate bird song.
Some of the protestors started stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received a command in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by the TIME magazine, which has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto region, sensed the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I got shot on the left wrist," he told the time magazine his bright painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youth was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told the Yohanes TIME magazine sad. Like many Indonesian people, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Chief Superintendent Yotje Mende of Papua told journalists that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, the spokesman for the Papua police force in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the killings took place in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, Minister for Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
However, he began to withdraw immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes, "he said.
In an interview with Time magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he had no intention of starting the investigation at Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranta of "crimes against humanity," which relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody declaration of independence in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto said to the TIME newspaper that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims have a gloomy disbelief in these allegations.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panese are afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had beaten him when he helped bury four of the victims.
"Soldiers will hunt me down after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the area adjacent to Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in the conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the leader refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital treatment was a 24-year-old Ravianus Dow who had been exposed to water while fishing on a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were stoning the police who responded with warning shots.
According to the locals, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, when one of the villagers was killed.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought into treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired at the police officers responsible and for a mobile police unit to be pulled out of the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real progress feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Daniel and Damal tribes who live in Papua's wheat in the midlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Paniainen, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arbitrarily arresting and incarcerating thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for local people.
Like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the crops are for the family, and the rest are sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences between local and migrant livelihoods have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants than local ones.
Few people in Papua have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The distant Papua remains with little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare film permit, because of their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor promoted progress by removing the restrictions on news.
"Journalists reporting on the most troubled eastern provinces in Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua, face new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting," said Kine in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numerous and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shootout.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the allegations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want the governments of the foreign powers to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who attended the meeting.
There is a presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papayans tell us that Jokow is unlikely to vote any more.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panese: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in deprivation and poverty, in practice without health care and access to education.
According to Gobai, the panaians, like the other papayans, consider the voices they have given Jokow to be "debt ', which must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shootout once again demonstrated their opposition metaphorically: they buried one of the victims on the opposite land of the police station and military headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora barks about the cancellation of Robert Helenius's rematch: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to fight in the Hartwall arena on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora falls on Helen's shoulders for the reason that the rematch has been flopped.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent's fault.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora's boring.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the fight with a controversial award.
The ticket sales of the rematch went quietly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed until autumn.
There's been no news of the fight since then.
However, the withdrawal is no longer a problem for Chisora.
The fight would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick anyway.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the fight, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I need surgery, Chisora says.
The British says they're in about 45% shape at the moment.
He's not interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with a split vote.
The fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai the second time.
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee from a 337-metre-tall 79-storey building.
This was the second fire within two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one was known to be injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with the fire alarm aloud and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes, "a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue services, the fire extinguisher was able to extinguish fire at 4: 00 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Torch building commissioned a study in which it was found that the plates used for upholstery and insulation of the facade were the most damaged.
In Great Britain, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower insulation and upholstery boards may have contributed to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in the mouth of the river during the night.
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9: 00 on Tuesday and 5: 00 on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo marked Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in colour, registration number 27-REV.
They found Mopo later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveal a survey
A survey carried out on air passengers reveals that more than 20% of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited articles to aircraft past the US Road Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other sharp objects which they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said that they only learned afterwards that they had by mistake carried weapons, munitions or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the questionnaire and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results show that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7% of passengers consciously infringing TSA rules were Y-generation representatives and less than 15% belonged to X-generation.
Most commonly, rules were broken by exporting food and fluids on board the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that they deliberately exported sharp objects to an aircraft, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men told that they deliberately exported banned drugs to an aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the smuggling goods had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to export contraband goods past the security check - knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that did the survey states, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids are allowed on board the aircraft and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the seizures of the TSA are liquids.
For a while there was also the belief that books should not be taken into the plane.
Liquids are permitted for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Mr Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, took the turn of his decision to delay Obama's decisions to reduce emissions.
The day after 15 states had challenged the President of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, to court, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama regime to reduce the emissions of smog.
According to Mr Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads takes greater account of the needs of the decision-makers responsible for environmental issues in the Länder than in the past.
Mr Pruitt made no mention of the action brought before the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous decision.
The Länder should start to comply with the ground ozone standard for 2015 as from 1 October.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan, since the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hamper economic growth."
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA, and Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his mandate in attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged them to monitor and reduce methane spills.
In its opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his full translation of the rules on ozone only strengthens the cooperation of the EPA with the Länder in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and then waited for activists and others to challenge it to a court where a timetable can be agreed," said Pruitt, who, in his previous mandate, sued the Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us. "
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider change in the ozone rules.
The bill adopted last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The public prosecutor Eric Schneiderman of the state state of New York, who was the head of the state coalition that brought the EPA to justice this week, said that the group was going to press on.
"The transformation of the EPA as a result of our actions is a major victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In addition to New York, the case involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is produced when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems for sensitized groups of people and is also part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed the surprising change in the direction of Pruitt.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to get the guy in charge of our breath to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump regime, whose ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups of self-interest."
From a super-car manufacturer becoming a SUV... it's going to be Ferrari style.
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari style, President Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at the press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News announces.
All cases of measles in East Savo of the same virus type
The measles infection of the coastal salm is the same type of virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reported by THL.
The virological laboratory at the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in East Savo is the same strain as the previous infections.
THL has ensured that measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July is of the same type as previous cases of East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in East Savo relate to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that no other types of measles virus have emerged.
It is possible, however, that new infections may still occur after the fifth disease, until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over, "says Mirksuena Erkkilä, doctor responsible for infectious diseases in the basic health care of Soster.
Since the fifth confirmed case, no new cases of measles have been identified or suspected.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination protection is up-to-date, "says Erkkilä.

Finland is preparing to make a legitimate scream
Pontika soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
In the background, the argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Making a scream at home will be legal next year, but legalising a moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, the moonshine by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces not only alcohol but also methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the moonshine soup as a right of every man, comments from Government Advisor Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of moonshine was not considered to be legalized.
It was not brought to the political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, "says Mr Outi Mäkelä.
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups of government parties who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can't even admit to distilling the moonshine at home if you have an application in the future.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importing tells us that home production of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can make a legal scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavouring and flavouring substances and allows the production of the scream, "Mäkelä explains.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring materials produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you like, and you can give them your own alcohol as a gift.
It's still not allowed to be sold.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft alcohol law is now under review by the Department of Justice.
The alcohol law will come before Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to South African Hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atterideville Prison.
According to British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for an investigation.
The spokesperson for the Pistorius family told us that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico into building a border wall.
The litterings of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, in a telephone conversation, Mr Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speech on the fact that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto to believe that he had knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also released a flat call from Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia was' ridiculous', 'pathetic' and 'stupid'. According to Mr Trump, the agreement negotiated under Obama would make him look like a 'idiot' because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull, "This was the most unpleasant call of the day."
Georgian massacre: activists restaged racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in a small town of Monroe in the country of Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and peeps through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-n-n-n-n-n-n!"
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this tragic event is only a resetup that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the sigh of shock is real when the noose is inserted into the neck of "Roger."
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to restage the 1946 events, when Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested in these years - even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps set up the resetup.
"It's a disgrace in history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil society activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, resetting is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want to finally get things over with, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI reports from NBC News, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching Monroe and the surrounding counties.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, the activists say that the motive for lynching has always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the black people of the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential elections, which was adopted by the Supreme Court in April and held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident at the time of the elections where a black landlord named Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said there was a rumor in the city that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to FBI records, a powerful white landowner named Loy Harrison paid $600 bail on 25 July 1946 against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks says it more succinctly.
"It was a voting right murder," he says.
"They were murdered because the black people wanted to be told that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reestablishment of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade now.
The proposal is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the appalling racism which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides too," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's performance began in June. On the first day around 30 actors - a dozen black and twenty white people - gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh works as Green's assistant director.
He has been playing the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the reframe for years, but the role is always just as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," says Marbaugh.
"It is important, however, that this side of history should also be displayed so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, there are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester's been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me?" I said, "Get off my land."
Rascona or Hester will respond.
And then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) will laugh.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he says.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think white people used the word" n-- "" u. "
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, to honor the memory of those who died.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are smashing.
No one's laughing.
The resetup ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots... and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress is standing next to the bodies and singing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few ten metres away, about fifty spectators wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Half the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple here to see a show about Ithaca in the state of New York, but most of them are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims with Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene calls the crowd to check the bodies.
Kids squat to look at fake blood and unmoved bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will be thanking the audience.
The actors who play the lynch, they take off their cloak and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors, and then he comes to tears after a rough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforts me.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a reason. "
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from Altanta is discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is having a hard time finding words when she describes the feelings that the show arouses.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch horrible acts that are said and done by people who look like you - just because they look like you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynches are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"Restoring is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a educational experience," says Brooks.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. "
Riding plants in shops is a puzzling thing: This much is actually saved by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves from the cauliflower before weighing?
How about taking off the big hat piece from the pineapple? It weighs a lot.
The answers strongly divide opinions: for some, it is a sign of extreme incompetence, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go into the dumpster at home.
The phenomenon will be identified in the shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store's bio-waste.
According to the news published by financial messages, sniffing around on the vegetable counter is a surprise to traders.
But how much money will it really save to remove the extra parts of vegetables before weighing them?
How important is the sniffing technique really at stake?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take leaves or strains out of pineapple, canned artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: the price of a cauliflower costing EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 when it shelled off all the leaves.
Pineapple: the price of a whole pineapple costing EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Globe artichokes: the price of EUR 2,60 was EUR 2,40 when the short-lived stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost EUR 1 and without strain 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains go off, save a few tens of cents at best for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of the vegetable fell by as much as 20%.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved for these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brass Star signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar had paid a price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish League.
The huge transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league held back the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment company.
According to the rules of the League, the purchasing club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out the contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who supplied the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to the new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will look into the details.
In its communication, Barcelona also stated that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (Uefa) in order to enable it to determine the disciplinary measures that might be involved in the case.
Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, has suspected, among other things, that PSG would use its money to violate the rules of Uefa's economic fair play.
Uefa can penalise a company that makes a loss of more than EUR 30 million over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its financial provisions.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the company's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by a state-owned qatari company, Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, sustained severe burns from the lightning strike, the flare was recorded in the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing the usual work on the plane at the southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues, when suddenly a lightning hit the plane from the rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane into the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, "says Austin's sister, Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in Sairala.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether it will be complied with.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on his business.
According to Managing Director John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by GBP 300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme aimed at revitalising the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell its share of the Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, a partner, who announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged, with a turnover of one per cent in the first half of the year, amounting to GBP 2,05 billion.
Convoy in Kabul: a NATO soldier was killed in a suicide attack.
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, where according to the authorities, a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others were wounded.
According to NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Kabul region of Qarabagh.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat in a mosque.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan military patrol was attacked by a "self-inflicted explosive device 'carried by a person.
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces close to Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where Shia Muslims are mainly living.
The Taliban announced that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the centre of Kabul in the bombing of the country's most destructive militant group since the US-led troops overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA shall suspend its decision on the suspension of the implementation of the smoking provisions.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fainted its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under the Obama regime to reduce smog emissions the day after 15 states had brought the Agency to justice.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone definitions" of 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, reflects its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the Länder," said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's statement.
In June, Ms Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018, according to which smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency brought to justice 15 states, mainly under the control of democrats, including the District of Columbia, which stated that the suspension of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama.
The Trump measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing of ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of his leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspicion was that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted prior to the security check.
The police won't tell us why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas dispenser and take it to a crowded public place, for example a public transport.
Deputy Commissioner Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation will continue as well.
Managing Director of Fluid: Renewable fuels did well
The pre-tax performance of the oil refiner Neste fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Managing Director Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to mild, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even if the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments that we have already announced in 2017, "said Lievonen in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the 66.7 kg series, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles, until the undefeated WBC lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the WBO High Feather Champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the Show with the unanimous decision of the former four weight class world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five in the list comparing boxers from different weight classes.
Garcia put out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck in the game! "
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7: 00 on Saturday.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect for sizes."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up [63.5 kilos] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small size for a hundred and fifty-five pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight show.
He's got to get into the weight series [61.2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes. "
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether the match should be organised on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and to fight Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the Jorge Linares / Luke Campbell match. Linares and Campbell will be playing in the lightweight series at the Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel offering the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is getting as much attention.
I'm fine with it as soon as we have a deal... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might be going to see the Saturday match.
Lomatchenko cut off the praise for Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing the impact force first and then boxing.
The men said they felt they wanted the match between them to be more and more effective.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case, "Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey's a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight. "
Average wage EUR 5 300, training whatever happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told me about Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor was full of crap when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
These are based on the new MiFID, which will be applicable from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements defined in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment firms carry out their own APP1 or APP2 degrees.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for the company APV investment degrees Oy, whose study group is composed of experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website states that in general both exams are "quite wide in terms of requirements."
The educational material of the qualifications consists of 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Oy, says that the pass percentage of exams is roughly 70%.
Of the staff of the largest banks, about all providers of investment services have completed either the APV1 or APP2 qualification, as they are mandatory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers, without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have shunned their qualifications, "says Savikko.
According to him, there are "few" bankers like this.
According to Savikko, the APV1 qualification has been completed by 13 000 to 14 000 persons since 2000 and the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors by about 3 000 persons.
Some banker shops consider the completion of a qualification to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is precisely the investment sector that will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial advisors make several thousand euros a month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average earnings of regular working hours for the monthly-paid are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men in positions earn good EUR 5,900 per month and women over EUR 4,500 per month.
On average, the decile of those who make the most money earn about EUR 8 100.
The decile of men who make the most money earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the women who make the most make EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At employee and function level, self-regulation has so far been relied on.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva resulted in individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient for the firm's activities.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if their skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, in principle, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have considerably stricter skills requirements, "says Savikko.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened by the new MiFID II.
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
In turn, the financial supervisory authority should be given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, the market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the present is the legal requirement for the knowledge and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the employees of investment firms and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court states that according to a proposal from the Board of Directors of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is expected to have the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided on in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and follow-up and further training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has a duty of proof that this has also been done.
The Court states that, in practice, the company is required, for example, to map the personnel's job profiles at the individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of demand depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
According to the Court, it is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced with the deadline if the skill or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, the changes will lead to stricter and more concrete rules.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra's persistent beach school pupils are not affected by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen polski persistently with the help of the swimming village
All went at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, the young swimmers are not mossed, "says Taina Itkonen, the leader of the swimming schools.
This week's swimming schools have a total of 13 children with swimming skills, a dozen next week.
The number of children for the coming week was influenced by the fact that the school and the Eskar started, assessed by Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is co-organised by the "Sports Joining" project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a comfortable atmosphere at the beach in Liette.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with swimming sticks, someone without them.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first suspected going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to peddle towards the beach.
You're doing great!
All told me that he went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the slurry beach is a good one.
Like all the others, Iines and the swimmer village worked hard on swimming Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, "said the swim instructor.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again, he wanted to take a water bath.
Her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swimming on the beach, Ilona Villberg sees the beach swimming school as a good starting point for learning how to swim.
No matter what the weather has been, Anna has always liked to come here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys had a lot going on with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, nibble fruit and roast the day.
The lesson went on in the water, but there was no hurry at the pier.
It's the kind of thing that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a story that connects"
You can see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, the Blue Product made cleaning products launched a series of Unknown Soldier products.
I mean, dishbrushes and laundry racks and "toilet-brush with edge bristles."
An unknown soldier refers in these autumn to his premiere film and film marketing.
Yet there is something special about the combination and the products have been grossed up in social media: When will the unknown health bonds come?
I have to call the company and see what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President and CEO of Blue Product, say?
We're an associate of the film.
We're here to support this film, just like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, "says Määttä.
He said that the products would be presented in a special way and that the film would be visible.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is a common story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company supports his basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen an old unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to military culture either, Order points out.
Other business partners in the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall vichys have been introduced, for example, by the name of Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already cancelled by Finnish Kuvalide blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time for continuation.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, the Refiner, Neste and the German retail product chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The results of the new age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published, and the results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method show that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not all consider the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests will allow a more accurate assessment of the age of the asylum seeker, which was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
To date, 6 880 tests have been commissioned by the Immigration Service and the results of 2 481 tests have now been published by the Agency. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of the 80% of those tested, 2002, asylum seekers were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases the Medical Service determined that the person to be tested was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18."
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Legal Medicine Agency says that the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent. There are no large differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were found to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and indicated that in 442 cases there were "indications that the subject was 18 years old or older '.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it appeared that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of the knee joint, and then the results are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karoline Institute, whose work includes an evaluation of human biological maturity, which can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we are not sure how old we should not pretend that we can do it, "he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Legal Medicine Agency, argued for the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of identifying a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject will soon be 18 years old, with a risk of about 10%. "
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over-par results in the third round were spent on Mikko Ilosen's 30-point scoop down in the golf European tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday at 11: 00, but at the end of the tour was found to share 41.
In a difficult reel, there was a double bog with three bogs.
Other people were having a hard time.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, went up to the top in one of the "under par" rounds, even though he told me that there was enough work to be done holding an umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I hung along and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with his countryman, Callum Shinkwin, and Andrew Dodd, Australian.
Governor of West Virginia is changing party.
On Thursday night at Trump's campaign event, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would switch parties.
"I was simply abandoned by democrats," he said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience has burst into rampant applause.
"As a member of the Republican Party registered tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice didn't support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the National Committee of Republicans (RNC) published a statement that "Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to a democratic party that is building obstacles rather than a better America '.
"The democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that connects people," RNC representative Ronna McDaniel stated in his statement to the CBS news.
Flashlights sown damage - Thursday coming up in the summer of the toughest thunder day
At the end of the week more thunderstorms will also be available in Southern Finland.
During the past week, there have been thunderstorms especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
Between Wednesday and Thursday, the lightning strikes started several fires.
Meteorologist says Thursday may be the toughest day of the summer so far.
The Thunder Deaths have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week, lightning has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
With the table, the lightning struck the terraced house's power center, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of a fire at approximately 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna area at the end of the terraced house.
The fire department dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire hydrants and quickly extinguished the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
On the other hand, lightning lit the outer building on Harjulantie before midnight.
By the time the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue service had no choice but to prevent the spread of the fire.
An outdoor building about 50 square meters burned to the ground.
In the direction of the dome, the lightning struck the home.
The people of the house were outside the building, testifying to a baking lightning strike.
The rescue department was there to check on the case, but this time the lightning didn't cause the fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when lightning shock damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the defect was received between 8: 00 and 9: 00 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be resolved shortly before 5: 00 in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has continued normally even on the runabout section of thunder.
The lightning has been wreaking havoc all over Finland.
However, the lightning has been relatively small this summer.
This summer's thunderstorms have been quite complete! assessed by Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on call at the Finnish Meteorologist.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small lightning balance of the summer, many of them feel even strong.
This might seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what it's been this summer compared to thunder, "says Tuvinen.
On Wednesday, the land lightning rampaged 1,700 times, and on Thursday, there has been potential even for the toughest day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 land lightning.
If the lightning continues at the beginning of the evening, then we can reach over two thousand lightning, Tuivinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunder year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume was around 30,000 pieces.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18 386.
So there is still something to be done so that this year does not break the 'record' of two years ago.
But the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and moist during the rest of the week, which is a good environment for thunder.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to shift to Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where approximately 2 000 days of lightning can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more coherent rain front in the central parts of the country.
Tuovinen says there's only so many thunder.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the global sports boss of the world, praised the apology he described as open-minded by Russia for the doping scandal on Thursday, but he added that it was not yet time to put an end to the ban on Russian participation.
On the eve of the World Cup on Thursday, Dmitri Shljahtin, the Russian athletic leader, said at the IAAF Congress that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken gold or silver medals in the competitions."
In spite of his comment, the IAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from the athletics competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct; it was a very open-minded presentation," the President of the IAF, Mr Coe, told the journalists.
"The entire Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and expressed its utmost commitment to reorganising its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for the lifting of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status in the World Sports Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Task Force, said that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing remains insufficient and the non-operational coaches continue to operate freely," he informed the journalists on Friday following his presentation to the IAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not have the success that the authors wished for, "says Yle.
If it is said honestly, I am disappointed that the film produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle, CEO of Helsinki Film, during the interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100 000 admissions, which is the film's budget of around EUR 5 million, little.
It wasn't a lottery win, but now it's important that investors get their money back.
If the movie had been better at home, they would have had their money by now.
Now we have to wait for the little streams of foreign distribution, "Sucksdorff says.

How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive player in football history.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, the European football regulator, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play financial rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the closure of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying the transfer sum of Neymar and linking him to its star guard, as it is followed by the funding of the ruling family enriched with Qatar oil.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums to buy players, but they need to be balanced by real income sources so that the football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up at the initiative of the French President of UEFA, Michel Platini, elected in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was a hoax and led to serious problems if banks or owners backed up.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game financial rules shifted from the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play rules will run until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the UEFA Presidency in a scandalous way in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the financial rules of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it may account for the amount for the entire duration of his new contract.
Since Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of EUR 44,4 million over the next five years.
On the basis of the financial rules of fair play, the first sanctions were issued in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and on Manchester City financed by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing their income through companies linked to the owners of the club.
If, for example, a company in Qatar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was excessive.
It has also become clear that some of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be financed by contributions from Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organizational Commission.
However, the PSG and the Organisational Commission have denied that Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to past PSG sanctions, UEFA will follow the rules even more closely than usual.
On Thursday, the known sources reported that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last season have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of company products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% as a result of the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to complicate Neymar's transfer, which was allegedly in breach of the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, said to the Spanish newspaper AS, where he referred to the ownership of the PSG by the Qatar.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports magnate.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state. "
Now we're in a hurry: Finnish World Championships coach stuck in Helsinki
The height jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the triple player Kristina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach general sports at the World Cup in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
The willow bay will compete tomorrow for the long jump, and Mäkelä for the three-mile race on Saturday.
However, the duo's coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has been trying to run the case on the British Broadcasting without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but it has also not been suitable for obtaining a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what the coach director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in handling visa issues himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It's not that big a deal.
As soon as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach could be left behind.
The World Cup Medal to Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Sports Championships will start in London this Friday and will last a good week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Universal sport, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sports that Finnish bench athletes can take with passion year after year, whether they have success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Fewer attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young sportsmen and women from one title to another, where experience is gained to mature the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Cup is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, though there are no hard-core athletes either.
The World Cup Medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attractiveness and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It attracts bench athletes to the TV screen and glue to watch the races, even if the London medals are not solved due to the time difference until late in the evening.
In 2015, Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in athletics.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Pitämäki.
The daring people are waiting for the Longhill Medal now, although one is told by the recent results of his and other shooters and the fact that Pitämäki will be quarantined at last summer's prestige competitions.
No matter how you go to these races, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, getting to the final competition or making their own record is a good enough performance.
The hope and belief in the realistic pursuit of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be a great success for young people in international competitions of values this summer too.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small number of elite athletes.
Success will not come in the moment but will require years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Let us hope that the London Games will go down in history as the Games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Eeni Rukajärvi is second in Copperi's big air - "But I do feel bad"
The snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump on the caballerial 1080 for the first time in a race, and that was very close to success.
I feel good and I feel good right now, but I'm really sorry that the last jump didn't go quite right.
I'm gonna try it again from now on, think about Rukajärvi.
In snowboarding's big air, a contestant jumps out of a jumper made for the sport.
Viking Line's new speedboat stalled in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking's new speedboat FSTR is very late.
The speedboat was scheduled to leave Helsinki at 6: 00 p.m.
There was a loading on the ship around 8: 00.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to catch a boat.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, the Estonian waiting for boarding at Helsinki harbour, Johannes Rebane, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical failure.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought water bottles to the ship for those waiting in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that there was a technical flaw on the side.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed a few hours from Tallinn's return trip.
The ship was due to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Route 6 on Thursday night.

Police are controlling traffic on Route 6, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
At the point of the bogeyman, the transport takes the road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story is looking for both the days of the '80s glory of characters and the' 90s grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great State sketch series for MTV) and their own time - 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory that we are stuck in in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's been around for a while.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it told us, among other things, the background story of the vegetable oil speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as coveted teenagers approaching adulthood, highlighting that which makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it is a parody of '90s stalker movies, such as a horror movie with a hand rocking cradle.
At one point one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not got over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there is a crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as an accomplice to George H. W. Bush (who is well played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best part is the side paths.
It's especially fun to see a kid named Paul Rudd, who has a beard under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from Singles.
The moments of random madness may lift this series into flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans, the Cold War Spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s where a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism Leninism.
The famous Gregor and the idealistic Iosefina are seen as Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching chess on television in the same way as the Americans watch football).
There's a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
However, the Comrade Detective is too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama - for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That's why the show is often beginning to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might be better served as agitprop satire, for example when Gregor and Iosef visit the US Embassy and lobby always have two fat men eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as turds.
The Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise in the ring on Saturday in Macao against a former UFC fighter.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao, because last year Leandro Issa from Brazil was still fighting in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has a jujitsu black belt and a world championship.
For once, I'm fighting a parent.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru says.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made in the China Autonomous Region of Macao on a quick schedule.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It pissed me off because getting ready and working out took a lot of time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
Waiting for a week doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transfer doesn't work out because it won't improve in a week.
It could get a lot worse if you practice too much right now.
Tauru has faced opponents in a few of his previous struggles, whose strengths are in vertical fighting.
This time it's different.
Daddy the kouvolan describes a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes on hard in the first round and tries to take me to the carpet.
He's won the Jujitsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvolan's last fight didn't go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Beligon hit Tauru hard in the eye, and the victory was left in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing: he didn't get a single shot.
When I left to pour, he hit me in the eye.
It was a shame for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three fights last year.
Now the second battle of this year is ahead.
Sometimes it's hard to get pregnant.
In the last few years, I've been working out, and I've been in good shape all along.
But the only reason I've been fighting is because of the fight.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change scenery for a while.
I was in Espoo working out, and I got the joy of doing it back.
We had a really good workout with a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've had to train against opponents of the same size and practice the vertical match.
Being able to fight is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit it rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take you to the property myself.
Downsizing should not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macao attracts Tauru, who has been taken in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's gonna be a big, fancy evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been untenable and the easing of inflation has stopped speculation about interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank has postponed interest rate increases because of increasing pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6-2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and warned that households' income levels would be under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation driven by Brexit, and the Bank also announced that the cost of loans could be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw some of the massive economic package, which began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, even if it is now expected to provide low-cost funding to the banks, amounting to a total of GBP 15 million more than EUR 115 million.
The Protocol to the Bank's decision on interest rates states: "According to the Monetary Policy Commission forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the fall in real household income will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "a certain tightening of monetary policy" in a slightly broader context.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual 'and" limited'.
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7% for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened in relation to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5 per cent and was USD 1.31. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates dampened expectations of interest rate increases. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the Bank said that the situation would deteriorate before it got better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income from falling over the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the effects of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25% following the tragic outcome of the EU referendum, which brought the pound down.
The Bank considers that the overall impact of the decision will probably not be reflected in prices and the economy until four years later.
Prior to the most recent decision of the Central Bank, the demand for interest rate increases had started to become even louder as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation dropped to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the Bank it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess over its target level of 2% was due to a "totally 'weak pound.
"In view of the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying as creditors are feverish in their search for customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. The renewal agreements are becoming more popular, with low interest rates, and there are also cost-free alternatives."
NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV medicine for 10,000 patients
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "revolutionary" HIV inhibitor; the Supreme Court concluded the dispute over the funding of the drug in the public health system (NHS) in England.
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of the trial. A pre-sexual drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling, which states that NHS will be able to pay for the PrEP, even though it claims that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the British NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday a "major new intervention" and was described by the national AIDS organisation as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to receive enrolments for an experiment that will be extended to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full potential in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a pre-sexual HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high-risk groups.
The medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that the body contains enough drugs during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates for the experiment for males, women and transgender and those who are not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and registered as a general practitioner may also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and this week NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the medicine by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another major achievement in the struggle for more than 30 years to solve the major health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is correctly targeted against those in need and at risk, it can have a revolutionary effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, those at risk will receive a drug that they can decide on independently without the need to negotiate with a partner through the NHS-funded experiment. It will have a powerful effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news. "
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP used in the experiment has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event, which was prolonged unnecessarily for several months due to the slow-down of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
This experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to a situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been halted. "
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
The former banker Joanne Leigh, who was excited about renovating the properties, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the Queen Anna's era-style house. Joanne has not yet packed and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I was here at the apartment show, and I noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment back then.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day. "
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a duplex where the bedroom could only be reached from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to make use of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands, "he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was given the task of exploiting the space of nearly four metres of high rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required Erfan's creative thinking.
"Steel structures are pretty complicated.
The spaces had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to cower in them.
The structures had to be adapted so that the height is just right on top and below them. "
Erfan was able to place the space on top of two full-height rooms with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, Retrouvius' copper-grated window opens in an elegant lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrics, the feeling of space and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window with a view to the other room.
There is storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware in the mirror furniture at the entrance.
The more classy it gets, the more you can hide the kitchen when it's not used.
Kitchen equipped with a folding door is not a new solution.
but in Joanne's kitchen it is unique that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says about the steel reinforced veneer door of the MDF.
"It is balanced, which means it slides very easily when it is lifted into place."
With the rational use of the space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and a better bottom solution.
"When selling the apartment, it's the area that counts, or the value of the property," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional bond of the apartment is partly created by them," says Erfan.
"No one attaches to the electric wires running through the walls.
They are also important but not in the same way. "
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and additional organisms can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia was radiating in her summer look.
Princess Sofia's choice of costume just hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented at the ceremony with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a magnificent blue body costume, which was beautifully dressed as a pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the scene in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event of representation in which Sofia represents before she is born.
His due date is September.
For dinner at the event Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue dress the princess nicely.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was literally radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited at the event to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stand appeared in Lahti square where Thai food was sold.
The Lattians didn't dare taste, they walked by.
Panya Suamsri-Pentti sold food at the stand, among friends, Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and the Finns did not know Thai at that time.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tasting.
This is how he taught the bay people to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got hooked by a spank.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant in Lahti's shopping hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and you have limited places, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because they said they smelled too much of the spice paste they made themselves.
There's a new place at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we rodents are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times we are shy to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows her clients.
He'll be told where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life of the customers varies and the food society changes.
He remembers which man I went with to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me skinny and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat by the kitchen door and catch up with the Panja who's leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing he gives us.
He's taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet hot sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste, but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many talk to him in Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
The restaurant work, he goes to the mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was secretly celebrating two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention went this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
In the early part of the year, the security authorities received a list of important aspects of the fight against terrorism.
The list contains information on more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, there are 173 people in total and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening newspapers told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have become revised.
According to the newspaper, special forces in the Iraqi army found a list of terrorists' personal data and photos when they examined the underground base of the terrorist organisation in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of Father in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also specifies the specific areas of terrorist activity.
For example, Sami J., a 27-year-old German on the list, reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
It is reported that he left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join the Isis ranks.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his picture as a specialty.
There's nothing more specific about what happened to the man.
In total, around 6 000 fighters have left Europe for the Isis ranks, the fate of which is uncertain.
The man sank under the surface at the Tokyo beach in Helsinki
According to the interviews at the rescue department, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
In Tokoinranta in Helsinki, a person underwater was rescued on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, firefighter on call at the Helsinki rescue service, the situation was quickly over.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue diver found him under the surface, "says Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after 5: 30 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Mr Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also very well advised by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars crashed in Eura, nine people hit in the cars, three were seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, says the on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around 4: 00 in the afternoon.
The accident occurred when one car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the on-call firefighter.
According to the rescue department, the intersection has a speed limit of 80 km / h.
The brothers are fighting over $500 million in real estate.
Two brothers are arguing over the largest real estate empire in Victoria, worth more than $500 million, and the dispute concerns a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former president of the Carlton football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in Tororak's prestige area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. A younger brother has taken the dispute to the highest court over the division of property and business assets between the two brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to raise assets when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that expanded to a chain of 160 stores.
The market was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrenna, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to a contract with the deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul describes his father as "the power and central figure of the family."
According to court records, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns some USD 316 million in real estate and Paul owns some USD 176 million in real estate.
Paul's not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court following several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says it's not true, he blames Paul for the mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, family is my priority," says Colin in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of valid statements, e-mails and reports, including consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who established milk bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought the property in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he set up the store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the properties to their boys in a friendly way.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court," Anna writes in her statement.
The other two boys in the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group's business, and Colin says that Mark received $10 million and Luke received $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial conditions of their departure."
Colin has been keeping a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian League League Association and the best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire according to this biography that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutiis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he said in his text that he could not comment on it properly because it was being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name into the fight for justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said that he still wanted a solution to be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is going to limit the use of the president's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new White House Chief of Staff intends to limit President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss doesn't get in so much trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with the management staff on his first day of work, he raised a key problem that he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information. "
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate, Mr Trump, was upset about the unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who was an advisor to the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
"According to six former campaign workers in Trump's Twitter management, it is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know - maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more intense without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unsent.
If his staff has at least been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to push their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view, and that information can be reliable - or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about an incident:
"The current and former workers of Trump say that he may be extremely angry at newspaper clippings in which he is criticised - especially if they mention harmful data leaks - and then he will be forced to know where the information comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the President a copy of the news on the GotNews.com site established by the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrew them later, and he also failed to provide concrete evidence.
Despite that, Trump had started to ask the staff about Walsh after he read the story. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Rerence Priebus, and the White House Secretary, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump. "
And what was the result again?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, says the news agency AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar had paid a price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish League.
Mr Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to the Parisian Society PSG.
The huge transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, which paid EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by a state-owned qatari company, Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis pro, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Oranen defeated alcoholism and fear by hypnosis: "I am in the best shape of my life."
From TV series, Rose's time and clean white sheets were just celebrated by the well-known writer Raija Oranen for her 69-year-old birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold their hands so well as to write that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once driven by the depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
Even the external appearance is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to fall when the serotonin medicines were stopped, they were anti-mood pills.
I used to get help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also helped with fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people away, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling together for over 45 years.
I've never felt better.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism sector, have been together for more than 40 years.
I proposed, and that was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama she's always been, quit her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her.
Oranen, who has made a great writer's career, only remembers a good 44-piece clean white sheets from a TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to become the industry of the Raikka family's clothing industry when I read the 50-year interview with Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I was a mannequin, "Oranen recalls.
He thought the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of the Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and claim revealed it, "says Orane.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts in progress - hundreds of ideas.
The travelers returned across the ditch to the "millionaire alley"
The wealthiest owners of the West Midlands are once again on the lodger with stubborn travelers who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans near a street called the Millionaire alleyway in Solhulli.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as a barrier to passage, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The travelers managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the town of Solihull of "total inability to solve the problem."
A resident who remains anonymous says that the travelers came on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers.
"The municipality must be hardened to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travelers were here in May, and then they left, but they came back again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today. "
The resident said that Birmingham Municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the travelers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even put a horse in a pasture park."
According to the spokesman of the local authority of Soluhull, the municipality is aware of the illegal encampment near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Soluhull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report to the police any disruptive or criminal activity.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for the trial. "
The angry people surrounded the Portuguese plane.
In Portugal, men who made a forced landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, the maximum duration is 16 years.
Yesterday, a small aircraft flying by men was forced to crash on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of which ran from a landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who had his back on the plane.
Immediately after the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
Whoever was at the beach surrounded the small plane right after the accident, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating her ass, reported the incident in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle more people didn't die.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
Tragically lost Finnish star won the World Cup gold again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Cup gold banked slalom in the Canadian Big White competition.
In the past, the Grand Hamari won the Cross World Cup gold.
All in all, there are already three World Cup titles.
Pretty amazing World Cup!
Two times treated with gold, a pretty good heart rate is drawn, the phone-reached Greater Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old calculator thanked his trainer and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of contenders in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paralum board has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse in the back.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He'd been counting with his friends since he was young, and the accident didn't take his mind off the hill.
It comes to mind from time to time, what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in waiting.
The cards will play what is divided, the Great Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and the Greater Hamari does not.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say it turned out to be a victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the greatest boating activity of the 23-year-old Greater Hamar was already fading.
It was only after the accident that the work started on top.
I used to work out with my friends when I was a kid, and we were always so excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow at the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I was thinking, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and get bitter and sad."
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star, the wheelchair holder for the year.
A four-time Olympic champion received his award at the January sports gala.
According to Greater Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal to the Paraurist people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the paraurism world.
When will it be time to launch the Matti Greater Hamar year's sports campaign for the double world champion?
We'll see about that in due course.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Even yet, the Great Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he craves.
Next year there will be a great goal.
In a year, they're going to visit the Paralympics in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
The "A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges' study examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread in refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young people in Syria do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis are the most important things that should happen in order to allow them to return to their country of origin.
The Trump regime is not seen to bring about a change in the conflict in Syria.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller explained the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years now, Mr Burson-Marsteller has been studying the views and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges study examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, 400 Syrian young people aged 18 to 24, half of whom are women and half men, were responsible for the survey.
Half of the interviews took place in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return permanently to their country of origin in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents can think of returning to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the most affected by the young people's decision to return home is the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in a permanent return home, while a quarter of them believe that the most important thing would be the departure of the Isis.
Only less than one tenth of the total number of people who have taken part in the decision will make it the most important factor in improving the economic situation or leaving Syria for Bashar al-Assad.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The young people in Syria were asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the renunciation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A good quarter sees Al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to bring an end to the current conflict in Syria.
Solving the conflict through military action alone is nothing more than a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see that the power of Isis has weakened over the last year, while the fifth feels that power has been strengthened.
According to respondents, the most important thing in the fight against Isis, and in general against terrorism, is that the media should inform people that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many of them gave priority to military measures and reform of education.
In the opinion of the tenth, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will get worse during the Trump era.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the Internet in order - his database uses Wikipedia and Google
The Espoo company MariaDB develops the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed via the Internet by any competent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of the databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and even the images are linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the Technology Director of MariaDB, spends about half his time encoding.
A man who works at a distance from a beautiful person makes sure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, Oracle left the software to devour Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they would leave.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not make a definite promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
At this stage, he had already set up a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about 20 of Sun's best developers and made sure that the code's continuity was secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the free development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL no such confirmation was made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Our growth rate has been around 50% a year in recent years," says Kenneth Paqvalén, President of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a narrow-mindedness about the company's key figures.
He will reveal that in the current financial year MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million of orders.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which may be more than a year's work if the client has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB will succeed in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South East Asia DBS are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks," Paqvalé lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oracle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner states that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit rapidly growing, sintes.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases do not even reach a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open or at least started.
The big companies will not get new customers because most of them will next choose an open source code.
This has led to the fact that licence fees for commercial databases have gone into the clouds.
Companies want to make the same amount of money as before with a smaller number of customers, "Widenius wonders.
As switching closed databases is cumbersome, the majority of customer companies have swallowed up price increases with obedience.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
But he still believes that the customer's measure is about to be filled.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later be transferred to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous price, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major system changes when transferring their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, a lot of people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the biggest growth financing ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now going to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB's financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is wasted in Finland on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot or cannot do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known promoters of open source code, along with another Finnish developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy is stepping up its approach to non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that use their ships to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," said the Home Secretary, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Torin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitt's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized a German vessel of the Jugend Rettet aid organisation, whose crew was suspected of collaborating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, the aid agency refused to comment on the detailed charges brought by Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoso.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," stated the organisation in its social media statement.
"We will only be able to judge the accusations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the authorisation of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boat-to-boat refugees directly from the traffickers who had access to the boats again.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres away from the coast of Libya, and this information can be found in the prosecution's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Luventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to supervise the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Frontiers.
Mr Minniti, for his part, pointed out that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, as he sees as showing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He pointed out that this month there are plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected of killing his cohabiting partner on Enontekio, the suspect was found in the terrain, a case against the DA.
The suspected crime took place in Kuttae, Enontekio, last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech male was suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that after what they did, the suspect would have fled the country with two dogs.
The man was found cold on the ground, and he didn't resist when he was captured.
The case will have to be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be held in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, who is known for Harry Potter and all my furry friends, is dead.
Robert Hardy, a British actor, has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy started his acting career at the theater at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of the magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a vet in the James Herriot book-based TV series "All-haired friends of mine."
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.

A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and making phone calls to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed to the Court of Justice and had to wait for the application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened with 20 years in prison, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy sweater, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a weeping look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, "the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the cause of the incident was "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age, maturity and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecution read the statement by Lynn Roy, Conrad's mother, who told me that "not a day goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this. I will do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear. "
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that he was "haunted" by the idea that he would never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never go away," Camdyn said.
There seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it became clear that Carter had been using his text messages to incite his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know how many ways there are," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy in the last two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy killed himself, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention with Roy's death, and that the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of whom is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, who was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: Ways to Russia worst since the Cold War
The NATO military alliance with Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, as Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Mr Stoltenberg said, however, that NATO is still committed to acting in such a way as to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, found that the US-Russia gap was even dangerously bad.
Mr Trump said that he would like to thank the countries for their poor relations with Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi changes 850 000 diesel engines due to a setback by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement BMW offered to update over 350,000 car software.
The head of BMW said that the company believed that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions'. He referred to European cities, including Munich, the home city of BMW, which are considering restricting or banning diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve the CO2 targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralise emissions increases, making it difficult to charge cars in a competitive way.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of agreeing with the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies tried to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to the standard test. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Many Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former director in charge of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
The vote in Venezuela began with a fraudulent investigation, with large demonstrations in the pipeline.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuela authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election result, the Chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, said to the journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end.
On Sunday, in a controversial vote in Venezuela, a delegation was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations to take place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces started taking over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday evening.
The purpose of the troops is to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
The lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers were feverish in their efforts to find a solution to the problem.
"The Lavender is in direct danger in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change. As a result, the rainfall in spring and especially in autumn has clearly decreased," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the life span of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a large number of small plants in the area that spread microbacteria. "
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought after perfume and cosmetics ingredient.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer essential oil components."
The solution is sought by improving irrigation, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a clay-water protective mixture, and developing more drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist is a manifestation of a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper, which is published once a week, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how it deals with the most recent cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routine.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or including them in a shipment that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They're asking journalists for names for each group, and there's no need for evidence.
They write down names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels who are criminals who make the chaos of Mexico life-threatening.
In December 2012, President Enrique Peña Nieto took office. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. It says "Justice." Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, the 30-year-old journalists, are wearing T-shirts, decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a brand-new shawl.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor was set up, in particular for the handling of journalists' cases, but according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two cases have been prosecuted so far.
Journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice, as are only a few of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year.
Riodoce's journalists are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said that the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
On 15 May 2017, Valdez had left Riodoce's supply in the State capital of Culiacan.
He had driven his red Toyota just a couple of blocks away, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired 12 shots.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn his wife and two grown-up children.
Rumors are moving fast, and they're free to go to Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is being kept quiet.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death on a daily basis, and there are two-storey double-storey burial buildings of drug barons in the cemetery, which are larger than the homes of many.
In a state on the coast, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a rival group that is waging war on the sons of Guzman.
The case may have angered the Guzman boys: the clients suspected of being members of the gang bought every number in the newspaper as soon as the magazine came to the sales outlets.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodoce. The magazine shares were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became familiar with its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hardcore investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after he was founded, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Freedom of the Press award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade unabated.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he got the prize of the Journalists Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, "Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"A journalist must accept a mission that falls upon him..." or play a fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here - why didn't I tell you what was going on? "
Riodoce's staff need Valdez, a joker who used to swear like a dock worker, and they need a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, and they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He used to wear a Panama hat all the time.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and he was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were going to kill him.
The death of a colleague has also led them to wonder how best they can do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of cases, "Bojorquez says.
In the best case scenario, that meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust in your own instincts.
If you feel like things aren't right, you have to stay out of it.
The problem is that, according to Mr Villarreal, Ridoce's journalist, "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only government-sold spyware had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied to the shadow of a tree for shelter at 40 degrees Celsius.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half-joking about whether it was these two police officers who were among the 50% that the governor of the state didn't think was reliable.
It had been months since journalists had been in the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's Ridoyce delivery was planning three major cases.
The boxing force Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper was also going to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the DA's office, had a group of people kidnapped.
There was no official information as to who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician of the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid a military raid.
A few months earlier, the readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the abduction from the Valdez column.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco" due to her thin body structure.
"Now all communications with our sources are out."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and labels against persecution from journalists have been kept. The employees of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-freedom activists.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took a few signs with him the next morning when he left for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor's office due to the murder of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of espionage and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Mr Valdez had repeatedly said that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organised crime, the authorities that allow crime and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on instructions from politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Article 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
The murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamulipas six years ago.
There was a note by his body signed by the Zetas cartel saying, "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some of them will continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, on its front page, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals search for the journalist, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once supposed to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Ridoyce's journalists sat in front of a delivery on the sidewalk on Friday night when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to vibrate as a sign of a message.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort, 19 people had been killed.
The war accelerated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on the Riodoce website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
We had to redo the front page the next day.
The sirens were howling in the vicinity... another shooting.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who were guarding the delivery.
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait where the man shows the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about ending the operation. "How can I shut down the paper when our intern asked me to go out on the street and do the same thing as Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Hard spot"
In April, Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, had a short party because the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the training period started in a catastrophic way when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started a long period of infirmity that lasted almost five weeks.
May was practically gone when she was sick.
First there was the flu, and then there was the kind of paediatrics I had to eat an antibiotic course on.
I was only able to make 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick for so long.
It was hard when I couldn't take advantage of the training effort, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was only allowed to practice in the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU rollover test of 12 June.
In the test, an athlete skis with skis on a carpet, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After each three-minute period, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall, I could last 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There was a wall, Manninen says.
A better way.
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells me she's been healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to try to normalise the metabolism of the body.
Now there's a really good five-week period in the back.
Midsummer also took a week and a half off from flying work.
My family and I have plenty of time to go to the cabin, too.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening competition when Manninen rose on top skiing to 18.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the national team's head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan up to next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a three-world cup weekend.
In December, we should be involved in at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, "says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympic Games would be the sixth Olympic Games of his career for Manninen.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City 2002 gold-celebrating team competition with the Nummelian underline.
The dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by camouflage.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now the scientists have revealed the first findings of a creature the size of a rhinoceros found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that the experts call it Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had remained so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had had a "troubled past."
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to study his findings further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontology Museum.
That's where the beast was dug up for six years out of a 300-pound block.
The results of the hard work are now available.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as Mona Lisana of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The leather studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor masks it from predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter coloring under it, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus has taken the headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have given it a name from Borealopella, Markmitchelli Museum Technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
The nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected by a general coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter under.
The observation was still a surprise, because Borealopella is much larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It leads to the conclusion that the flesh-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution preferred to hide as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of today's animals, for example deer, zebra and armadillos have the same coloring, which is much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," says Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales of the nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including its intestinal contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm at the time as it is today in Florida and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because its scaly leather has been preserved and has also been preserved in its original three-dimensional form," says Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous Age.
It does not require much imagination: if you squint a little, you can almost believe that it was asleep. "
The Cretaceous era was the era of teropods, huge two-legged flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopella, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armoured dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex was preceded by, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in Current Biology. They believe that Borealope washed up in the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's most preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armour from nose to hip.
The nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilos.
Their pallets raised two six-foot spikes.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore passed through the current West Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in little detail in an underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have remained so well that its skin remains in the armoured bumps along its skull.
Michael Gresko wrote in National Geographic that this kind of survival is "as rare as winning the lottery."
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of that skull band still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate its footbed scales. "
How did one activist learn to answer the question: "Who do the streets belong to?"
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived one day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid and his body is still on the street."
He was confused that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
In his timeline there were numerous re-tweeting from the user @ TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, a white cop who had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri State.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he got back on Twitter later that night, they told him that people were gathering at Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of police footage and screaming people and of the man who claimed to be Brown's father who was carrying a sign that said, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of the police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another cop setting up his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers having said.
"It was not the kind of murder we are already used to and could be described as typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried. "
He booked a flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11: 00 p.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter at his father's house and decided they were going to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years, a documentary film entitled "Woman Streets?" has been made. It premiered at cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell was driving towards Ferguson with his daughter in a flower dress and a crown compatible with it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live black and what conditions." They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of today are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow into it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living black, and he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like all the other black girls.
I feel like I would harm her if I protected her from reality. "
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is across the street from the police station. It became a camp for activists while they waited for information on the case and eventually found out that no charges would be brought against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and passed them on to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to look at activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the Association of Minority Nursing Students. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell had doubts in his mind, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The source of this suspicion was the countless times that people had appeared in the local community, usually white people, who simply wanted to take advantage of its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan told us recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
The presence of Davis led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The shooting team followed the events in the years following the shooting of Brown.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," says Davis.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are presented in the film because I am presented in the same way."
Mr Folayan said that the intention was not to focus on Mr Ferrell's experience because it was to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community." Ferrell proved to be the most open one to be described.
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs at what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story renews and restores the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (# BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of the black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to deal with everything. "
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including a large number of queer women."
However, he points out that Ferrell was not selected for the document "spontaneously" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," says Folayan.
"However, it is no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen. "
The news crew has left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left on parole, and he was convicted of obstructing the freeway in a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political climate in his home world is brief and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned from the outside in Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We have to love each other and support each other.
We can only lose our chains. "
Suitable similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York is hung in the middle of an exhibition space with a face - white, black and brown faces, where you can see a resemblance more accurately.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples of Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison, where he served his 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transcendent and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced on the third last day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and based on his genetic data created 30 portraits. They are a sharp, albeit slightly theoretical, statement of the relevance of DNA data, ambiguity, and underlying cause-effect relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, her birth name Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified herself with women since puberty. In 2013 she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, where Manning sitting in a car in the driver's seat, with a platinum blonde wig on his head, which became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a very popular Stranger Vision project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA data on cigarette butts and gum, for example, and he created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a new exhibition at the press conference.
So the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked her if she was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his captured muse suddenly became pen pals and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a "Supported Images" comic book depicted by Shili Kanungo, which described a future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is fighting his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose."
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement, and underneath it is Manning's great signature, where the last name i is the point of the heart. In his statement the artist demands the end of the "automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture have been based."
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA sequence: a long string of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters - or nucleotid, as the scientific definition used by the artist is - Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that the genetic data are very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," it says in the picture.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive, I still get the chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data as a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe a mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind her release."
Professor of Northwestern University and employee of Oxford University are wanted for murder.
Police report that they launched a nationwide search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
It appears from Cook County's court records that on Monday, warrants were issued for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of complicit in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police officers were alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building and found a victim with multiple incision wounds on his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident, and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunologies at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-Principal for Social Relations at the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University helps with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement sent by the university and Somerville College spokesman by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and are ready to assist the investigating authorities in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly clarifying our search," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me that security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair," says Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board published the following information to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I am not an anti-Muslim, I am Catholic," condemned said the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
According to the police, the staff at the bookstore called them in on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
Suspect left the store after threats.
They caught Moffatt when he called the police about threatening him.
Threats had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the book store, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt said to the police during questioning.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay legal expenses of GBP 620, or approximately EUR 690, and compensation of approximately EUR 95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the work of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) road map to restore the mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the road map measures have already been taken and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's mandate. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the mukko, it contains nothing of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and the WADA in the near future, "Mr Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities accept publicly the results of a study by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, who has been ordered by WADA. McLaren is investigating the alleged role of the State in the doping of Russian sport.
That is what Mr Mutko said: 'The investigation is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist. "
The words of Mutko echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems with the Russian anti-doping apparatus. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We are not going to adopt the report unconditionally, "he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scale of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Mr Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow. After that visit, he said that the organisation was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical about innovation that is dear to Finns: Health benefits of maternity packaging "there is no evidence"
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardian report that Lullaby Trust, who are fighting the death of children, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packs distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack reduces the risk of cot death.
A hand-to-hand death means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert in British health authorities in the field of child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, as it would suggest that we recommend this product, as announced by the organisation.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teen pregnancies.
The fact that they give each family a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain, "said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and infant deaths.
The maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland free of charge for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items, such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The pack itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, packing can be the best option for sleeping if no crib or crib is available.
The organisation recommends that the package be used only for nap time and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
A crook ran away from a Japanese zoo the second time.
The staff of the Japanese Zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff with speed and has run away for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, "Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told us.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about three feet tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo has received no eyewitness reports of a turtle.
The last villain's escape happened two weeks ago.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, "said Yamane.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These start-ups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online start-up business, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the employees were sceptical about them.
"The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective," says Errett. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online shop. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
A growing number of new start-ups in human resources management have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employees' commitment. Companies can carry out surveys and target specific teams and groups of the population and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the government beyond the top management.
"You can follow your own health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says that he has gained a deeper insight into the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to ask questions quickly and to vote for certain teams, and it can also provide a map of which you can see, at a glance, which departments are the most dissatisfied and which leaders have received the weakest assessments, which have enabled Errett to drill into the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has been swarming around since a former worker wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and people who talk about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to the Let's Talk Payments website, could reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, the state of Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to do tailor-made surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, workers can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there is any reason to suspect the director of any misdemeanours, the complaints will go directly to the company's board of directors.
"Public opinion has superseded the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or works unethically, the consequences may be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose its employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily connect with the headquarters.
In the past, it was a practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or e-mail address with which he could file a notification at the head office, and then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Chief Legal Officer of Ruby Tuesday. According to him, it was difficult to follow employees' complaints.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state; problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive view of the worker's reality," says Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from labour-related litigation."
Mr Quinlan said that companies began to take ethics, values and workers' commitment more seriously after Arthur Andersen, the audit firm, collapsed as a result of unethical behaviour in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent public debate on their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is charged on a regular basis.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture capital investors, and both Glint and Convercent are supported by venture capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of USD 60 million.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and risk capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages are good, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and respected and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the company's success if they are happy in the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn, who is responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors get a profit when companies succeed, companies get a profit when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employees' commitment, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to the experts of the workplace culture, it is important to know how employees are committed,
but it is useless if no action is taken.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce workers' commitment.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, the management consultant, who has seen companies rely too much on simply gathering information.
"If the company does not take action, the employees will start to wonder if they have been consulted.
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly staff surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
After Mr Errett had collected feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated workers, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in a sector known for their high turnover.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies. "
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing his naked female neighbour, "says news agency TT.
The woman who lived in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging outside her window at the end of the rope.
According to the woman, the camera on the cell phone was photographed in the apartment.
The woman who was spooked by the incident had run into the other room to get dressed.
When the woman had arrived to check on the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but was then recalculated to the window shortly after.
A 20-year-old male suspected of being undercover has admitted to having taken pictures of a woman.
But he claimed to have only taken pictures of her face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
During the hearings, a man admitted to the crime, but denied guilty of the crime.
The man had justified his description by saying that he loved his neighbor "totally crazy."
According to the news agency TT, the case is being prosecuted against a man.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than that of the export industry, for example, but should be narrowed down, "said Olli Luukkkainen, President of the OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public holidays highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination does not in any way involve the financial cuts that have been made.
In the local government sector, contracts are expected only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukainen predicts that, for example, the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Luke didn't reveal yet.
Luukainen is also the chairman of the public-sector trained negotiating organisation Juko.
Luuskainen: Holiday money surgery increases earnings development differences
According to the OAJ, the statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is diminishing, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukainen, temporary holiday money cuts will lead to even more pronounced differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be determined how many pupils per teacher can be:
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the worst are growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
The Bruins players' day was extended as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one.
It's almost 11: 00 in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys and their backs are shining off the sweat since the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of chat is a midday break.
After three hours of training, players studying in summer courses at the university will return to the dorm to study for final exams. The next morning they meet at 6: 30 at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says just before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of university sport reduced the number of daily exercises from two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the workload of players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started at 15: 15 in the evening. Players already had full schedules were hard to find room for.
Limiting training hours to one day means that there are more training days than before. This year the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time during the training course of the six seasons of Mora Westwood, when the exercises take place at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparations for the opening of the season will begin: UCLA will meet Texas A & M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA's change of rules, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and to the Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombed with football flying over the net behind the paint pole.
The Bruins players are due to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film exercises on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises pays a lot of money.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not going to put too much pressure on my head.
We have a plan. "
Freedom for Rwanda
On Friday there will be presidential elections in Rwanda in Central Africa, the winner of which is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing his third term, but in practice he has had an influence on the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the rebel group, the RPF, ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of falsifying poverty statistics, for example.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to make the effort because the Constitution, which has been restricted to two periods of presidency, has been amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been carried out and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in bringing together the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamek has promised his people more freedom after the country has been brought back to life.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting false news by stepping up the verification of facts
Facebook intends to send any false news more and more to independent fact inspectors and present the results under the original article. The largest social network in the world announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of false news. Many people believe that false news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The issue has arisen in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with false news before the presidential election in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the verification of facts is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightened what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook News feed on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the related articles and make other changes to its news feed in order to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
The little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known as the music video of Squeeze and Margaret Thatcher as a hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now, in a charming place in the River Valley of Bewli, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who likes old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says vehemently.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of the families in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the thumb print in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent working for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as an illumination.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel like he's there himself.
I love the archives! "
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the British National Arts Council, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay for a little longer than would have been desirable.
He spent the days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyenas hung on walls and bottles of centuries of moat.
He went around the old castle on the ruins and on the estate and talked to the forest rangers, gardeners and sometimes also book-picturesque artists.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotland's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was entirely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation's staff were only just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extra to the attic.
The archives had journals, letters from the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "One might imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here families fought even for one birch.
I was thinking maybe we should just let it go. "
Some of the stories in the book go from castle to history in England, like The Labourer. It's about a man who will join the peasant rebellion in 1381 shortly after the castle was completed.
"The Knightly Familes of Kent and Sussex mention that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant rebellion in England began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start in a riot.
Perhaps these events are connected? "
The other stories of the book are closely linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell's family hid for seven years during the purge of faith in England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. It is said that he staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The family's men seem to have been quite a bunch of guys. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome guys who knew how to mangle the heiress. "
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book on the Livemämäki, a sanitarium that worked at the beginning of the 20th century, where only an eutrophicated plot remains.
Scotty Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
♪ You've moved to Russia the worst since the Cold War ♪
The NATO military alliance with Russia has clearly deteriorated, commented on the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia of this and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, as Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Mr Stoltenberg said, however, that NATO is still committed to acting in such a way as to prevent tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, found that the US-Russia gap was even dangerously bad.
Mr Trump said that he would like to thank the countries for their poor relations with Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
The long-standing heavyweight champion of professional boxing, Vladimir Klitshko, ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, fought as a professional 69 times, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two fights of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him with points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild fight by knockout in the 11th.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet at the rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitshko couldn't find any motivation for the fight.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision so that I could get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitshko told me in his press release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never imagine having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Look at Klitshko's reasoning for his decision on the video.
Klitshko's manager, Bernd Bölte, stated in the press release that the decision to close was difficult for Klitshko.
But he's always stressed that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Böte said.
Klitshko has been dating an American actor named Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different unions at the same time.
Finnish weathermonger engenders conditions: "Export from the phili"
Minna Nikkanen, the pole jumper, has suffered from conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikanen has had some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her out of her head.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The circumstances have been this way against Minna Nikka, the pole jumper.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was unthinkable that I couldn't even get the little sticks moving properly, "Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here for God knows how many times and I have never experienced such mixed winds in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin in the Games.
This season it has been very difficult to adjust the jump when there have been such unstable winds during the exercises, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was on Thursday in London, too.
It's been pretty challenging getting the technology together, is it cold-frozen or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe away.
There's no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
He got into the World Championships because of his power jump 455.
It's been 445 outside.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday's tryout 460.
Why don't you move out and work out abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technique stabilized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've got to practice in the hangar. Now the hangar's closed.
What would be the ideal way to compete?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
A little wind will do as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official put politicians in a bad position: "We have no room for distribution now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the Government of Juha Sipilä must keep ice in the hat and guard against the increase in the State budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for sharing.
Yle interviewed in 2015 about retired Virta at the First Saami on Wednesday.
The construction of next year's state budget is just beginning.
The recent proposals made by politicians, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, are considered by Mr Virtanen as election speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution either now or for many years.
I even think it's cheating to talk about a dealer when you take debt, "said Virtanen to the High.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debts owed to children.
The current has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: he started in 1978 as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of the Budget.
The last time he retired, he was Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Mr Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Mr Yle that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All the predictors estimate that this is a thorn from which we are going down next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase for tens of years.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permits
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy, "says the media.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret were photographed in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henrik, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the pair of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not wish to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the Court states in its statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the chief communications officer of the court, Lene Belleby, commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the desire for her husband's burial place and understands the decision.
The moment of terror on the road: the car almost hit the freeway
Tom had a cohabiting partner and two little kids on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but they will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash took place at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Kehä III.
Vantana Tommi says her family survived on Tuesday by a miracle in a car accident.
Tommi, his cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
A white car, which almost drove to the side of the family car, was driven along the acceleration lane from the connection of Ring III to the Hämeenlinna fairway, "says Tommi.
If it wasn't for evasive action, the car would have come with him.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, "Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing very fast.
The parents and the two little kids in the backseat didn't get hurt.
One child is slightly under three years old, the other under one year old.
Apparently, it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed by even drove towards us, even though there was a lot of traffic in this place.
The accident occurred around 5: 20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue staff showed up and the family was checked out.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi tells me he and his cohabiting partner have low income, and they got a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, the family won't get the money from the insurance.
That's why the family wants witnesses to see the car that drove the family into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to kindergarten and work without it, "says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably the late 1990s or the early 2000s.
He thought the license plate of the car started with SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every inch of it today.
Tommi hopes that whoever saw or knew what had happened will be in touch with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they had a job on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally told in the case, the second car did not enter the lane of those who would meet him, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
A performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships by humor - The Self-exposed will be seen at what? - on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first-born guidance to the "What?" theatre.
The self-exposed is a musical theater performance of past relationships and inadequacy.
The director, Lotta Jäppinen, said it would still make you feel good.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
You don't stay in bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what you reveal when you get to know a new person.
Do you think he's playing a role or maybe he's going to get close to the other one?
The unplotted performance is confusing facts and fiction.
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatic the show.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-exposed does not directly tell about his own relationships or the relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own world of values will be taken care of by the show.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
A lot of people learn from their divorced parents.
Jäppinen believes that the Self-exposed draws a current picture of young adults living in a 100-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships with their parents, many of whom have resigned.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén, Otto Rokka.
Ella Snellman is also a member of the team.
The arrangement of music is Jäppinen and Roka.
♪ Love for the theatre was born in Kouvola ♪
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying as a director of theatre at the University of Turku Art Academy.
There's two years in the back and another one in the front.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The teacher of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Superior Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in steering.
The self-revelator got his premiere last week in Helsinki on the stage of Narri.
The performance for about 45 minutes should also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study town in Turku.
On August 4th, 7: 00 and August 5th, 2: 00 and 7: 00.
The Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - the neck spine broke
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of Kumparelaku traveled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of an Olympic ball.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
Not only was he a tireless intern, but he was an experimentalist of new species.
There may not be many forms of physical activity on earth that the chemical lake has not tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked the wounds in my house for a year, "says Lahtela.
The bay had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the disaster.
You know, riding a motorcycle can sound pretty wild.
But I didn't use it to get boundaries.
It's just so tough as a species that it's not worth too much for a 40-year-old!
After the accident, Lahtela was put in a very special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long start in the back as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in employment as soon as her career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged her protégé in slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn't make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it, because for once in my life, I just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to be Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he might have burned out.
It's easier to find places in your body that are broken than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the buggers.
I traded the motocross for Frisbee golf!
I mean, it got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Even though Lahtela has always been a super eager trainer, she does not require her coaching staff to be like her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture there is room to be one's own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, "says Lahtela.
The sex robots are coming, and we need to be worried.
It's here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry just as it was beginning to feel that 2017 can't get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the spread of sex robots seriously," says the Foundation's founding member and the Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Noel Sharkey Sheffield.
Customers can choose between the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"The sex robots are being buckled, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," said Sharkey at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his or her own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
Even more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character features of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, e.g. shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website is advertised.
In other words, a robot likes the same things as a user.
It also has different moods:
It can be, say, tired, chatting or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features of the spread of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistant, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots aren't just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men do not acquire a sex robot and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
But the Marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says they can.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president sitting in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
The Handmaid's Tale (your slave) is not the most worrying of its powerful visual language, such as pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing part is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (with the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will of their own, no history, no independence, no violation of the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by Isis' chief
The head of the extremist organisation Isis led a group of Australian men who were suspected of carrying a bomb onto the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of his leading figures had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspicion was that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted prior to the security check.
The police won't tell us why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colourless gas dispenser and take it to a crowded public place, for example a public transport.
Deputy Commissioner Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured during police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation will continue as well.
The good things about Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like the legacy of common sense.
During the Trump period, it has been repeated to the point of weariness that families have also been broken up by the strong division of voters at everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of American newspapers provided guidance on how to deal with the families who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin came to visit me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who's been buttoned up against the Republicans of our family for a long time.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins' friends - including the Republican-supporting sister, who he's been arguing with for decades about politics - are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that is a good thing, but, more broadly, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left new power, but the perverse effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalisation," we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be afraid of his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump normalizes right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns at least we have seen). Compared to the trumpet, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be lucid and it will immediately feel like a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best we can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel horses are huge, the characters in the middle - the grotesque clowns and the animals that look back in terror - are ominous, and the underlying screaming music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's hallways become more and more disillusioned over time: the view of high buildings is getting bored, the city's silhouette is too familiar and the reality of the city is not in line with the dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I am not over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large roundabout in northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-minded pub, but it does not count.
The carousel in Central Park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience - even to the extent that two two-year-old women, one eleven years old and two women in their 40s enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if anyone had asked for my assessment, but luckily, no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
It's the same thing at a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but there I will also be given the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15% of the service money when I go to the counter to pick up the coffee myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer servant to put his person in play in a situation where it is not needed.
The shopkeeper of the department store smiled with regret when I tirelessly gave my credit card to the experience of five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Intert - "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq's club from the coaching duties of the representative team.
The responsibility for coaching is assumed by the former assistant coach Fabrizio Piccare.
The other coaching team will continue its current duties.
Italian Piccaretta has previously been an assistant coach in, among other things, the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccaretta, who joined the Intert coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the FC Intert Board, regrets what happened.
Changing coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option at the moment, Håkans commented in the club's press release.
The Picareta contract is valid until the end of the season.
He and the rest of the coaching team are already responsible for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to the evening-message reports, the team has been swarming all over Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccaretta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccaretta were strongly involved in the Interi match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violinist?
Linda Lampenius, the violin maker, published an Instagram of youth.
A number of taunts have been added to the picture, which leads to the conclusion that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders at the young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he sends a message.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
About a year ago, he published an Instagram of a pair of pictures of himself.
In one photo he's seen 20 years ago, in the other he's posing now, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a man and refers to eating disorders which he suffered from in his younger days.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added hashtag life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly of his eating oxen of previous years.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital for anorexia and orthopedic disorder.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to the hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecution filed an appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius too lenient.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, the sentence of Pistorius may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarian people arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarian illegally camped persons were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, and there were two Bulgarian members of the camp.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently announced the release of the Bulgarian people.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those who camp outside the designated areas.
The inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
The stock of liquid sinks - already sank -7.7%
The stock of the oil refiner Neste has fallen by 7.7% around 11 a.m.
Its pre-tax performance decreased but exceeded the forecast compiled by the Inquirey Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started today with a slight frost in Finland as well as in other parts of Europe.
Shortly after the stock exchanges were opened, the comprehensive European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent among the most traded companies.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were in the morning's result release and Nestea.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, the recent study argues that the opposite is true: a high-fat diet of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritated bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People suffering from irritated bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to the research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balancing cells that strengthen tolerance, which protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result may be irritated bowel syndrome.
The tests showed that immune cells that strengthen tolerability are present in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the ingredients of proteins.
"We found a connection between Lactobacillus reureter and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reurer is part of the normal intestinal microbiography," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan was in the mouse diet, the more immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reureter and a high-tryptophan diet may increase intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
When investigating immune cells that strengthen tolerability, investigator Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had these cells, they did not have them in mice of the same mouse species, which were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference had to do with the microbiomes of mice 'intestines, i.e. the normal digestive system of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
Six bacterial species were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice, when the intestinal DNA of mice was examined.
When Lactobacillus reureter was administered to mice who had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells in a sterile environment, immune cells began to develop.
The scientists wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, they raised Lactobacillus reureter bacteria in the fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid to immature immune cells isolated from the bacteria.
The immune cells developed into tolerability-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When scientists doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice 'food, the number of cells that increase tolerance increased by about 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reureter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reureter can cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritated bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of these cells, because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reureter may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho felt that Manchester United had a "genius" in its ranks after making a deal with Neman and Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" in line after making a deal with Neman and Matic. A midfielder debuted Manchester United in a fight against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final race before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best condition yet, because he was not on the tour of blue shirts in Asia before the beginning of the season. He only managed 45 minutes in the field - according to Mourinho, there has to be a change before the lead league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius - he has a natural ability to think football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting lineup for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has prioritised.
"Three out of four - you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
The volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost to Germany in their fourth World Championship qualifying tournament, straight from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routines are high.
Flat their game was in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi told the press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places with enough aggressiveness, we were able to swing along, "Kangasniemi said.
Pia Korhonen, who collected 14 points, was the most effective in Finland.
Three games out of four Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. in connection with the Russia meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and to the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaja, a known Russian lawyer for the Kremlin connections.
The news agency Reuters is reporting on this, which also confirms the information released by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday regarding the convening of the grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and the famous Veselnitskaja, which was held in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, current adviser to the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington means a intensification of the pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist a large jury in an investigation to investigate Russia's involvement in the presidential elections in the United States and whether Trump's campaign or his close circle cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury will extend Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence the prosecution has examined and decide whether or not to press charges.
The British inventor microchipped himself to his home and his car with a hand swing.
The British inventor has first microchipped himself throughout the country so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing.
The microchip is between a 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and index finger. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of the Northam company BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, the anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, in order to meet medical requirements for the installation of the microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's attempt also to make the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip, which costs £300 to handle one of the locks.
Northam is married and has one child and has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
Last month's decision by the White House to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House's southern lawn field for an event presenting American production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is aboard it. It was a attraction at an event in the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a bunch of White House officials came across the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter built in Connecticut, there was a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested that the helicopter be present with a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn field for an "exceptional" event. This is reflected in the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail message the day before the event to his superior who is the deputy commander of the naval flight crew.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the south lawn at 17: 07 in the morning and the event would start at 3: 00 in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave the area until after the lawn field was cleared in the evening between 6: 00 and 9: 00.
In addition, it was mentioned that if the helicopter was delayed leaving the White House, a second crew would be needed due to the restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether there was eventually a need for another crew.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, the HMX-1 was asking if the event was breaking the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act. We were told that there would be no breach," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was an official event in the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of the reform of health care at that time in the Senate and of a looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their travels.
but using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of its predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn field to bring the president to the White House within centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings to the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
On that day, the unit's helicopters also operated 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions'.
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman told me that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the south lawn of the White House.
The HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to the duties of the President, and it is difficult to assess the exact costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's annual compensation for 2017, the compensation level for VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, flights from the Quantico base to the White House in the state of Virginia took an hour in total.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called sunk costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the study carried out by RAND in 2015, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Around the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former White House press secretary, defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Mr Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to make this point. "
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the seat of the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump was joking with the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track, and the trains have to be replaced by buses.
Passenger trains between Seinäjoki and Vaasa have been cut off due to a technical failure, "says Railway Traffic Centre.
For the time being, trains will be replaced by buses.
Traffic control system failure was caused by thunder.
The railway centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela claims the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The State Prosecutor of Venezuela has applied for a court ruling to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that last Sunday's vote is due to be held on Friday.
In the contested vote, the country was elected by a representative body which could, among other things, change its constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the obstruction decision has been requested due to suspicion of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started an electoral fraud inquiry into the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company holding the vote told him that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuela authorities was around one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were nominated for the delegation, and the elected 545-member delegation includes, among other things, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the representatives can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions are widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitution as a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
For their part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise the new representative.
Mr Maduro argues that the new delegation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
Many people have been wounded in them and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after the oil price fell.
Now a lot of people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to express its opinion on Friday, when the new delegation is due to start.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the court of Minneapolis in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Maksim Senah to almost four years' imprisonment for participating in a worldwide computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland handed Senah over to the US judicial authorities despite Russian protests, "says AFP.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud, which had gained millions of dollars in profit.
Senah got 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the sentence of imprisonment.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The cheaters then used the data by continuing to control Internet traffic, which used to make click cheats and distribute spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the Acting Director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cyber criminals who work in other countries.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, "says Blanco in the press release.
Modified at 20.58: Corrected for the littering of the name of the sentenced person.
Narcos third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will play a leading role in Netflix's hit series

Kari Kola implements an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuu-based photoartist Kari Kola (Kuavsa) will perform an exceptional work of light art in honor of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next May.
Kola is doing a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The book illuminates the Fonteney building of Unesco headquarters and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to highlight not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution from millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the things I find important visible in concrete terms, "explains the photoartist Kari Kola.
I am very impressed with the invitation to be involved in the first international light day and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she lit UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to reimplement my art at UNESCO headquarters, "says Kari Kola.
The work may yet be expanded to a very significant extent.
We will inform you of this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The objective of International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light to mankind and to raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of Paris on 16 May.
Two men were fighting in a shopping center parking garage in Espoo.
Two men had a fight in Espoo in the parking garage of the shopping center Big Apple on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal quarrel between the drivers.
The driver driving in the forbidden direction of the car hit the driver of the other car and as a result, the car moved and hit the driver's car.
After this, he hit the hood of the car that hit him.
In the preliminary interview, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and that he did the wrong thing.
Timo Soin titled: "Then came the flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references to 18th century France in Soini's text.
King Ludvig XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used a meta-flood parable.
Depending on interpretation, the history books are left with the phrases "after us the flood" or "after me the flood."
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
Elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote on them, said the head of the UN Delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Mr Haysom, the interim head of the UN aid mission, said that there were hundreds of women in the elections for the provincial councils, three women seeking to be vice-president and more than 30% of the newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be emphasised too much," he said in his statement of Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The elections to the Afghan Provincial Council and the Presidential elections will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made electoral threats at the same time as the international forces are taking on an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power is passed from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that the contribution of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the site is only a few hours away and is stormed through the sights in large groups.
Venice is about to suffocate for the tourists who are taking quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move in the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre while hotels have been replaced.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give two or three hours.
You will follow the flag guide from the Piazzale Romano to the Rialto Bridge and the St. Mark's Market, and you will turn back, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism of the Italian Minister for Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular visitors of the historic centre of Venice.
The church of St. Mark is located on the edge of the square.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were around 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Venetian people protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives people away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships provide Venice with the income it desperately needs and create the need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change the situation if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is located, were to have more power over its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving around Kuopio?
On the motorway, heavy traffic jams for miles
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, there have been kilometres of congestion in the lane going north from Thursday afternoon's work during return traffic.
In the area there is a motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, "says Savon Sanomat.
In the case of road works, the speed limit is 50 km / h instead of the normal speed of 120 km / h.
However, even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had moved at a speed of walking in some places on Thursday afternoon.
The road work progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, the golden deer.
I get along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Luel has published wonderful pictures of herself, including in Grand Canyon.
Amalie Luel, a Danish-Norwegian national, has become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because she broke a 26-year-old Norway record in March in a 400-metre race by circling the track round at 51.81.
A month later, he cured the 400-metre fence run at the Norway record of 55.38.
Soon after its record, the louel, who is a busy social media user, found that fame and publicity had its drawbacks.
Men from all over the world began to send pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
The luel was forced to close off his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "dirty pictures" from strangers, so I had to turn my account into a private account, Luel told VG.
In an interview with the VG, Luel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he was getting.
You can guess. He was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after running, but I get along fine without that kind of attention.
Luel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Luel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia first because of her father's work, then to Pakistan.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Luel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish nationality to Norwegian nationality.
In Norway, Luel trains with the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions. They just give orders.
In Norway the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, Luel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's record at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence run.
The leg injury put the snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career on the line, and now he's in the World Cup, and he says, "It's nice not to get hurt."
It's been nice to count now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, who is one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, 31, has enjoyed her beloved species again this season.
Even last summer, a career extension was at stake.
The stress on the foot table had forced the Korve to the operating table in January, and there was no way that the leg would heal.
The hand had also taken a hit in the race line.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the boating would continue or not.
Sponsor deals were over, and a lot of things were open, "Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things usually work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back into the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that the first time I went to the snow.
I was like, "Hell, yeah, this is so much fun. Let's do a couple more seasons."
The raven didn't get a good count until September-October, but after a long recess, just exercising painlessly has been a big deal.
Only a few of them have been circling the races.
It's okay.
Contests have never been the most important aspect of boating to the Korve.
I've never counted because of one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you're burning up for that week.
I'm tired of thinking that, Raven says.
Today, Korpi will compete in the Halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Even though the individual races don't keep him on board, he always lights up when he's in high company.
According to Korve, the prestige of the games organised by the International Skiing Association has increased over the last few years, although some of the boatmasters chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yeah, this is a big race. It's a big visibility.
However, in my opinion, appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's holes, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the point where everything was new and so sick excited about everything.
It gives you new power too, Raven thinks.
I'm still on the slope, but otherwise, no, that's what the guys have!
In the background of the ferry career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The pilot legend Pekka Korve's son is addicted to race sports: the boatman has his own racehorses for which he does training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess hall.
But every day at least I look at the results of the nourishment and usually even some departure, "Korpi says.
According to Korve, horse steering and horse training are a potential career plan when a boating career comes to an end.
I don't want to plan that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the edge of time and develop, in the summer maybe even drive something.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start it when you're already inside the species.
There is also an Elitpähet cruise with the host Jajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitpäret race.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been excited.
Now we're at a point where we're not going to go bankrupt.
A few months to go, let's hope we fill the ship, Raven says with enthusiasm.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kite has taken everyone by surprise
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new caretaker for the 41-seat age group to be built for Kite.
The building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health road next to the health centre.
The general question of crystal is what is sufficient for the new care unit, because now many private care homes are short of customers during the Siun wars.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that in the future there will be more demand for Kite not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, "says Flink.
Attendo bought private care homes in Kanervikola and Eerika from Kitee last year.
The deal was about business, but there's a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie 's brand factory in Scotland
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's inventor's company of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the British General Trade Union (GMB), the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are manufactured by more than 500 employees.
The company Pladis, which owns the McVitie's brand, has invested more than GBP 5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will "certainly be the first to be told" if there are any changes to their activities.
In its letter to the head of the factory, GMB calls on the company to "respond to concerns that funding has not been allocated for the modernisation of the production lines'.
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, is extremely concerned about the lack of clear information from the factory manager about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and a continuous reduction in production, East Glasgow needs successful McVitie 's production badly. "
According to Pladis' spokesman, the factory manager had only received the trade union letter the previous day and the company is responding directly to the letter because it appreciates the ongoing interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we continuously assess all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness. "
According to the spokesman, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a production site and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the factory."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about the Neymar transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's quest after paying £189 million for the termination of the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The French team in the Ligue 1 football series is ready to break the world record for the transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half as low: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer sum of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will be the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than £500,000 per week after tax.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the PSG's activities and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the company. A source close to Barcelona tells us that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players clubs.
"I am not worried because they know that if they seek our players, we will become their opponents and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they seek our players, they will face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have done just this: it expressed its interest in the PSG center field player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

Now, the phone calls that Trump was glowing up were made up by a White House spokesman who said, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, "says New York Times.
Both the Mexican President and the head of the Scouts Association have been invented by Trump.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the Scouts' leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not only on the phone, but in person, Sanders explained.
The Scouts were disgraced by the talk.
Trump told me on Monday that the Mexican President called him and told him Trump had succeeded in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico again, because they know that the journey will in any case keep at the border of the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government issued a press release saying that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with the Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump was glowing at the big meeting of the National Patrol Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the boy scout, he said it was the greatest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scouts' Association announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' phone calls to Trump.
According to the press release, the previous statement by the head of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologized to the scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the Scouts' meeting was a lot of surprise, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he was glowing at the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
