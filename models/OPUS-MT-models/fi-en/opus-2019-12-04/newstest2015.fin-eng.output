Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not wish to engage in an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, "said Putin, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian separatists, which Kiev and the West claim to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops away from their current places where Putin said that the Ukrainian army was shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the residents of the region, "Mr Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Rhyme workshop.
It surprised me that people were coming in from the beginning of the night.
There were visitors in two days as expected, "says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hip-hop festival, which means pop is not going to happen, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law will enter into force on Tuesday to restrict the procurement of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to seek permission from the Police Department to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as explosives' starting material.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them, if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not normally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, during acceleration.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Valioliga: Super Raheem dazzled - Mario was overshadowed - Valioliga - Evening-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again demonstrated why he was seen as the hope of the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when the strengthened Liverpool at Mario Balotelli arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his top speed.
The Italian lost three high-quality paint spots and fed only half of its 16 assists to their own team.
The Pool supporters who have already taken the player as their favorite player expect better in the future.
The Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers implanted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotelli, sparkled the tip of the midfield diamond, Raheem Sterling, who pushed the 3-0 victory past the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, you don't just shine with your powers.
Balotelli's 20 centimeters shorter Englishman is between the opponent's lines than fish in water.
The feature is not common for a player who flies the grass at his best speed of about 34 km / h.
Rodgers also deserves great praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Ireland told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from a Northwest London who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen to be the conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Council of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin Helsinki City Orchestra as the next conductor since autumn 2016.
The newspapers up to the Los Angeles Times have been asking what band he's going to take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.

The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductor and I have worked with many orchestra members in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm, "he says.

Steak daddies.
The Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped on the league team Vampula athletes in the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula took five to win a long game of 3-2.
The last round of WoVo lost between 15 and 11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of me all the time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and the passport game Vampula was a little better, saw Wovo's coach Teemu Määkylö.
Wovo's hexagon was a bit risky in that six-inch American centerpiece Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the sidelines.
Sara Niemi played the centerpiece.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and she and Johanna Pekkarinen formed the most firepower combination of Wovo.
Jenna Kesämäki, who started as Hakurina, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian passer and a liberal Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo circled as much as possible.
Wovo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "merchant" at 18: 00 in the official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet again at the sports school.

More frequent death of ovarian cancer due to late diagnosis and inaccessible treatment in sparsely populated areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to pay tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and concluded that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher Susan Jordan QIMR from the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Scientists went through the history of women's health for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the history of illness and socio-economic status also affected the survival potential.
In older women and while cancer was more widespread, the probability of survival at diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to explain why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that there are potential reasons for delayed diagnosis and for difficult access to treatment.
"This disease is best treated by specialist gynecological oncologists, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although distance treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old mother of the family living in Gold Coast was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wishes to confirm the mobile parking activity in Friendship Park, next to the hotel Pohhov.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for the status plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding area should be made publicly available at a service point in Oskapta.
The draft format shall be submitted to the Environment Board and the Lapland Centre for Living.
With the change in the status plan, the city wants to allow the continuation of snowmobile activities related to tourism in the area.
The site is intended to be a park area which includes the area between the present Friendship Park and its river.
According to the presentation, no more than 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
You may also place refuelling points in a specific part of the area.
The new park area will also be authorised for maintenance.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
There has been a lot of resistance to the rolling stock and the design change.
The residents of the neighboring blocks have been starved by both the sound and the concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and findings beyond the guide values have not been identified in the surveys.
Even the modernised fleet is lower than the old ones.
The friendship park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were to be moved further away, hotel safari customers would have to transport to safari starting points by buses with an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surroundings of the Friendship Park are also large enough for sledges, better than the places proposed as replacement points of departure, such as the edge of the boat dock east of the Ounas bridge.
The friendship park is good for its location, even though activities can be expanded to include the Ounaspaviljong region in the future.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficient quality areas for logistic and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the general pattern of the city centre, which has not yet acquired legal force.
The fall in owner-occupied dwellings can be seen in garden stores
The reduction in the number of owners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of gardening stores by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the UK's Horticultural Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, apartment renters spend only 55% of the amount spent by house owners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanised apartments without gardens, and the size of the garden is also decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking space, and these factors also threaten the garden sector with an estimated value of approximately GBP 5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products spend the least money per household in the whole country.
According to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), however, an increase in the rental of housing or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading gardening advisor, says that "For example, plants grown in transferable growing vessels are particularly popular among tenants, as such growing vessels can be included in the move if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of success in the garden sector, since ownership and wealth increased from the late 80's to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will increase this year due to better weather conditions, since last year's weather in March and April was worse.
Turkey is interrogating an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the report was discussed on Monday by the US Embassy Commissioner and the Turkish authorities.
The German paper Der Spiegel and the online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former analyst of the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main spy target of the US and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all the major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the espionage against Ankara by the German main intelligence service resulted in a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
The Cannes winner Croze is performing in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been attached to the leading female in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights into the morning, whose shoot starts this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Women's Majority Award at Cannes Film Festival for his role in the Barbarian invasion in 2003.
He has been performing, among other things, in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film "The Butterfly" in the glass dome.
Mikko Nousiainen is the leading man in the 2 nights to the morning movie.
The film will be premiered in Finland in September 2015.
Chief of Police of Mallorcan Magaluf charged with corruption
The perpetrators of the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and Calvià City Council officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested for moist celebrations following corruption charges by the owners of the known Magaluf region and the bar owners.
Capt. José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several of Punta Ballena Street's owners filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena Street is located most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who reported the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the Calvià City Council at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The daily newspaper ABC, which appears throughout the country, wrote about the anger of the nightclub owners about the bias of the authorities, which significantly impeded their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one of the traders said to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer, when a YouTube video was distributed online, where an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to curb the drunk and uncontrolled use of Magaluf's vacationers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the pub club organizer Carnage were jointly fined for EUR 55 000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the communities of southern Israel bombed by rockets, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod in the south of the city of Pashosh, workers removed shrapnel marks from the walls and slides before the children arrived when the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children living in this area are in desperate need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks coming back to school after a long time is gonna feel a little weird.
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuben Rivlin visited Kibbutsi, near the Gaza border, to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had remained indoors or left their homes in safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the citizens of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Front are sceptical about the return after a Palestinian grenade was killed by a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a good ten families had not yet returned.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border, which was the subject of a heavy Palestinian visit.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the re-opening of the Gaza air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died during the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out more than 5 000 air strikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter in over 100 schools run by the UN, which had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still under shelter and as the fighting continued, the school authorities moved the beginning of the school the previous week.
"I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives under shelter at a school in Gaza.
According to the commonly used indicator, prices of dwellings have risen most in the winter months of Australia to seven years.
The price index for DP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures the prices of Australian capital dwellings, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, as shown by RP data on Monday.
With the rise in June, July and August, prices rose by a total of 4.2 per cent, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not increased steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, the research director of RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
The results of RP Data show that prices of dwellings rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the year before.
The housing market of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next busiest; the average price increase is between 5% and 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally high sales rate and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that the rise in house prices will continue over the next three months," says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has had record purses in Mänttä
The new museum and visual art have drawn record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, over 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has been exhibited by, among other things, classic pop art works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, Mänttä's art weeks told us that they had made a visitors' record, as 14.500 people had visited the Wait-Time event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been shoved out of doors and windows, "says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors this year will come to Serlachius museums to approach 100,000 this year.
There have been around 40,000 visitors in previous years.
Mänttä-Vilppula, midway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four robberies committed in the last few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, a break-in to a commercial property in Pohjänkatu was made by breaking a window.
Whoever did this had a small amount of money in the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a truck tank on Deep Oaks Street.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its outboard engines had been taken from the marina of the deckneck.
The rowing boat was a Kalapalta-branded light outside and yellowish inside.
On the inside, it said "OIL" on the nose.
A couple of suspects already got caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a break-in was made on the ladder creek road to a commercial property.
A police dog got a print and a man in his 20s was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police picked up another man from Paltamo who was also suspected of breaking and entering.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaani.
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge against a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man, and shot with a shotgun the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman, who suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the indictment and claimed that he was carrying another man as a shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, they found a broken shotgun in the car.
Kainuu District Court will pass judgment on the case later.
In many places, August was unusually warm.
According to the Meteorological Institute, the same warm August occurs every ten years on average.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Because of the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter looked 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley in the Midlands region of Britain in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between the boy and the father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rappie at an upbeat rate.
Henry's had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy a lot since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown up when I was a kid, went to the pub with Dad and discussed, for example, the shape of the beer cup or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about that kind of thing.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, which gave him an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than they were then.
The melting plants are a little brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth depths where the flames, smoke and soot are flowing and they remind you of hell.
My dad used to take a bath and just lay in the tub, and he slowly started singing to himself when he washed the mould dirt off of himself.
As I walked around the smelting plant, I realized that he had been doing that job for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite that, Henry's childhood lacked the intimacy of his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started getting sick a little before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother's death.
When I started suffering from a lot of obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a full turn.
After that, I started working out a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making the theatre.
Next up were the Comedy of Errors and August Wilson Fences ("Fences").
Making the theatre offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only 16 years old.
One of the deejay spotted him on stage making impressions and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's television career began in the mid-' 70s. "For quite a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living stardom and I was on television.
Lenny New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared black in makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian for the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been part of it, but I don't regret it.
Even though my position was strange and repulsive, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Yet the "British TV award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people."
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both the fun and the admiration of the black British culture were made.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy show Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with commercials, documentaries, TV shows and movie parts, but after his 2008 Lennyhenry.tv show, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just walking around on your feet or going off the sidelines?"
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About..."
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us at school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears stockings and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare issue raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me, "Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Why don't you just date the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much?
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost like some part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background check.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Shortly after that, Henry played the lead in Errors' comedy.
All of a sudden, I was acting in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, 'You must last 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed at relief.
It's not my responsibility.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play. Stay in the role."
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theater.
Learning the lines for Fences was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes you more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was as if a sign from the gods: "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry says, of course, in the voice of the KUMEALA.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
But Henry is still basically a comedian: the little kids of humor constantly interrupt our conversation when they switch from one impression to another.
Abstentions from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, because getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you want it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo theatre when I feel like it, but generally it doesn't inspire me the way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
There's always a story in the show, and I like it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya will draw up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not sign up for the register in the next two weeks would no longer receive remuneration, a notice from the Board of Directors was announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eliminate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an inspection carried out earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on the wages and other financial irregularities of 'ghost workers'.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register in the next few weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data are stored in biometric form, as indicated in the Government's press release.
According to the newsletter, anyone who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in its tasks, and will also clean the payroll lists at both levels of the government, thus solving the" ghost workers "problem," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The profit for Seinäjoki in 2015 may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
The potential means of improving efficiency were the reduction of the scope and level of services, the purchase of services, the sale of assets and subsidies, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
Of the EUR 10 million target, EUR 8.5 million will be invested.
There will be no relief for the local authorities.
New obligations for municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, rising unemployment and a 5% reduction in government shares will further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government is agreed that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategy objective, "says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Council.
The City Board returned the proposals submitted to the Executive Board for preparation.
The proposals of the City Council form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's Financial Seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the Board of Governors seminar, the draft budget will proceed through the Board of Governors and the City Council.
Tens of Turkish policemen arrested on suspicion of "plot" against the government
In total, 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for "anti-government plot ', as reported by local media sources.
The police didn't comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were in contact with corruption investigations last December targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale criminal group and monitoring their phones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at that time), said that police activities were part of the planned action against him and others in power by the Islamic leader, Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children go back to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
First of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in all Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will be of benefit to them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally embroidered children's shirts, balloons and the provision of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the slandering tweet was unauthorized.
On Sunday evening a slanderous picture of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas while he was hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was removed later, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent out of my account unauthorized.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I've deleted it," the later release said.
Perry's backup didn't respond immediately to any clarification requests.
Even though the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a blasphemous cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was charged. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, with three times as much as I can... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antiunion, appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge in charge to dismiss the allegations and has said that the law on the basis of which the governor of Texas, who was the longest-serving governor, is unclear against the Constitution in a mirror.
Perry cut the state subsidies of $7.5 million to the public inviolability department in Travis County and manage public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led the left-wing follow-up group to make a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated, and sometimes also famous.
After taking fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by publishing a picture on Twitter of himself jogging on the lake with the text "Here we come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is back to normal.
One of London's main developers has warned that the housing market in South-East England has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital of London's housing has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases, while the fear of widespread credit bubbles has led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and president of the high-quality developer Berkeley, said "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of transactions have returned to normal since the peak in 2013," adding that this has allowed for a "stable environment."
During the recession, the housing market in London went well with foreign investors trying to reach the capital.
According to land register data, the prices of dwellings in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by around one-fifth in the previous year, reaching an increase of GBP 423 000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric on a possible "manor tax" before the May general elections.
Last week Foxtons, a London real estate agent, warned that the April mortgage report, which reported more stringent lending provisions, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both sales volumes and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of authorised loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by three per cent, according to which prices are going down by three per cent, as the index measuring the price of housing owners' opinion has already started to deteriorate.
The number of trades made in the most expensive regions of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen to one quarter of the year ago, "says the realtor WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, correct product at best has remained stable and therefore sales have remained lively '.
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 new homes in the previous year, which is almost one third more than at the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% to GBP 380 million a year ago and turnover increased by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley told us that Berkeley's earnings for the year were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold on the London Stock Exchange at an even price of £23.96 this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold pictures of 100 other stars leaked naked pictures of Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence online.
The representative of the hunger game star confirmed that the photos were genuine and condemned the hacker for "insolent violation of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted.
The images originally published on the 4chan image release page had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other stars being hacked is claimed to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, as reported by BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the photos are real, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
But Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victoria" series denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are WRONG, don't you understand?"
Let me put an end to this from the start.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures of the star.
Only the hold that appears to us of Howard Jacobson's thanks for his new novel, which is about love and the letter "j"
They slipped, it best described what happened, gradually they separated from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally he heard from the woman that he was too serious, too labored, too intense, too detached, and perhaps also a little thorn.
That's when he swung his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had, in the early stages, been a relationship that had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have made it easier for him to be bored alone, and it could perhaps have brought his life up to some content.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and she was a delicate, spiritual beauty with a happy heart, from a village in the north, which was even more harsh and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Her aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley, and the valley was conveniently called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, the garden had weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailinn in a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to a distracted receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when the alinine crosses, suntanned feet brought to Kevern's mind a song which had been sung a long time ago by a forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to in the cabin's blinds below.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They had not been banned - nothing had actually been banned - they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, like the word "oblivion" itself.
Public opinion brought about what the laws and the proclamation had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read hero memoirs, cookbooks and romance, as far as music is concerned they prefer ballad.
During the day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing serenade to the big feet of Ailinn with an insolent comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and he naturally lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the "j" letter escaped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word "j" out of your mouth and didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned, either. It just wasn't played.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
It was the unpredictability that made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's Polish CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that she did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion here either.
An obedient society meant that each part of it accepted with gratitude - with gratitude, for being as if they had been spared by happiness - the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean roots are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that each family had a working phone that was used to run things.
Those who were left in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When those from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled fast in fear of being accused of flailing and afraid that those flames would catch up with them, opened restaurants where labneh yoghurt was served and a water pipe was burned, and continued their lives with their eyes set on the ground and boredom depressed.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballad, and it was difficult for her to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung could never have been translated into music.
The music was used to express love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the Bigfoot.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant kale leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was gonna say the whole thing was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"Dad thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head unbelieving, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing else to see in the whole world except Ailinn's huge, crooked hair follicle.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He'd wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and knocked over the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine was made of elderflowers, so it couldn't be used as a cause of the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what fascinates me perverse in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he was gonna hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the good northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had essentially been like life here.
The same vast, shiny sea that was riveting against them.
The same confused men, though more pale and devilish than their smugglers and smugglers, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or taunt them.
Thick head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suction first - kissing had become the most common word for an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; an antidote to the meaningless love ballad pumping out the receiver - to suck first and attack then.
Kevern thought that was too much, too much, because the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go, just like his traveling companion watched him go upstairs through the window, a man who was the reason for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He spent an hour feeling sorry for Kevern and his men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him in order to strike.
A man who turned his back, a cougar, a shameful, defeated man who had lost all his will to fight - why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a vision before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring public opinion in Ofnow, carried out a brief study of the continuation of minor and moderate violence in the areas of the country where the reduction, or even the end, was most likely to take into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"Much has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to counteract the inherent aggressiveness of the people who fought for thousands of years and who have won most often, especially in those abandoned and remote parts where, despite the church towers over the hedges, human kindness has rarely been known in the ages.
However, some things could not be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it creates.
The people are weeping with sentimental ballots, devouring stories of conquered adversity and swearing in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps a relentless grip on both rural communities and urban communal areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more eventful struggle in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatic," her director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum set his eyes on the ground.
Plus, I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
Although certain types of hypersensitivity are totally acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as those you have just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church and what you call cruelty or malevolence, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It's like it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, it's destroying the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingo pink LED light announced a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballad, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, don't agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and singing is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we are repeating the same mistakes that were originally led by YOU, WHAT HAPPENED, IF TAKEN.
But this time, we will not pour out our hatred and distrust to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe 'mistakes' the acts our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far to say that they shed their 'anger and distrust on others'. "
A person in a position like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not talk about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
We do not need to talk about it any more - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to pass out accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what is the past for then, if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers as "maleficent and rampant."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
The Lesotho military officials have denied that they faked the attack on the government and said that they were working against a police officer who was suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Head of State and his family travelled to a neighbouring country in South Africa after they told him that they had been threatened with death.
The military spokesman, Major Ntselle Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics." The police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
According to the President of the South African Government, Clayson Monyela, military operations looked like a revolution attempt.
"Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be all in line with the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to the officers of the Lesotho army, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjo Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says that he believes that action is being taken because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies discrediting the power of the government, even if it is claimed otherwise.
Trade magazine: Microsoft sets up a data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Uusimaa, where the company refuses to specify its location.
In a factsheet sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In the public eye, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been the location of the centre.
Microsoft completely stops at its Oulu office, which takes up a job for about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
The Microsoft Communications Director, Camilla Lindfors, says to STT that the company does not comment on the number of staff employed by the new data centre.
From the establishment of the Data Centre in Uusimaa on Monday, the Merchant Magazine was announced.
The man is accused of assaulting a girl in a traffic light crossing.
A 78-year-old man is accused of driving a three-year-old girl on a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of running a girl over at a crossroads in Pittenween in Eastern Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 car carelessly, causing her injuries.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges against Dundee at the sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to take place in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you have a choice of different equipment options.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed watertight.
In addition, set the camera's imaging settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a setting to optimise the conditions under which they are taken under water.
Plus, before you jump in the water, make sure you know how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others can withstand a depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and in digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures - many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to synthesize the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera also allows forging, which means taking several images at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is falling significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is an important piece of advice when shooting on land, but it is even more important under water because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle, meaning that the cameraman must be close to the target to fill the entire image up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing unrest of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests on the Hong Kong business block after activists start planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China to give the Communists the power to remove all candidates who disobey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says the Chairman of the Democratic Party, the legislator Emily Lau.
This isn't what Beijing promised me.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Mr Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that it would be too "chaotic" to stand as a general candidate in the election of the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Hong Kong was handed over to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through the Appointment Committee, which is administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong 'will be accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region took place in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings in the rain.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would enter a new era of civil disobedience and would produce protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give the details, apparently in fear, that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online newsletter, the organisers said that the movement "sees Occupy Central as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that taking the centre will happen.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, peace is fed by the feeling of many that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of those arriving from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood - the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to great economic losses, depending on how many take part in it and how long it lasts," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to see the spread of concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from us.
This kind of image would be bad for investment.
There are also stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are minions of the revolutionary Western powers. "
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people - more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
The American prom tradition strikes British universities: private jet for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by creating the first luxury British travel form for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable possible entry to the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in far-flung cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company representative, reservations have not yet been received because the service has just been set up, but added that "students will start making orders in the next few weeks."
The company believes there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and wishes than those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Higher Education Association, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority."
Many of their studies this month are beginning to be shocked by the level of cost of living when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the enormous increase in basic living costs, and only next time can we begin to wonder where thousands can be used for such a simple matter as entering campus.
Ipswich "pig house" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales image of the house on sale in Suffolk when they found that there was a big pig lying in the living room of the house.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120 000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.

The announcement describes the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom house."
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where it has been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Sal nearly fainted in the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget about his symposium of the United States and beat the second half of Ukraine with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted at the end of the field, that pep talk was so awesome.
It was just a blur in the eyes, couldn't help it.
That noise and the white ocean was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments contained nine surfaces in a fast pace, balloon exploits, disks and tampering everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into the flow mode that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to a place that's so important, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
To do all that stuff.
Now it's great to see the others caught up with the plot.
He grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joker and spirit maker, so no wonder his example raised the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year break: The previous ones were reminded of an outrageous game of judges
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the Argentine World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the last Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish illustrator at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a burning fight against France in the early section.
"In that game, the jury game was glaring," said Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game was going on.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shits went a little crazy, "said Parkkali.
Finland played in the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finally ranked 17.
Now Finland is back among the world's Champions, as Poland's World Cup tournament will be on its way today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in an international volleyball over the last 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever, "thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland getting from the beginning to the next round.
Then you can get tough, "Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victorious fight against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope we get to 17 now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down, "said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö were ventilating during the Tunis match.
Sauna and evening worship at the Buenos Aires Seaman Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup tournament.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita from the mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog got into trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini were valiantly offered to help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen told us in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, no hotel nearby, no passers.
By nightfall, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were willing to help: Antti Soini, the Tamperian, and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed for their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells him in a message sent to Ilta-Sanomi.
Soon, a German man came along with an excursion mattress.
From the mattress, Cita was given a stretcher-like pair, where the injured dog was attached.
A German man showed up a moment after us when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the hill for a while, "says Soini.
FIGURE: Tuomo Soini
They were able to carry the dog down with an excursion mattress.
According to the sound, the performance was not physically heavy, but in difficult terrain it was slow to carry.
But after about an hour and a half, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "international heroes" to thank them once more.
The Sones answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and credit, and I will be eternally grateful to them.
On the night of Monday, the Soines were already on their way home.
They had been very happy to hear from Mikkelsen: - Cita said she was feeling better!

Genetic aberration is often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared death for years because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had a diagnosis of another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor medicine, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and tightness of the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers thought he was going to be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached the age of 30.
Today, 51-year-old two-child mother says, "When I was a kid, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell down every day, and it took me longer in everything than anyone else.
I could never skateboarding or skateboarding with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than other kids.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had a series of Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they gave me information, I was in a state of shock and panic.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between, I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they told me what CMT was, I thought I'd been lucky," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
One hundred colonists were found in a coal wagon in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on the train carrying coal, as reported by the Ministry of the Interior on Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going, "said Ivo Koteski, spokesman at the Ministry of the Interior.

The Russian space experiment failed - the gecko sent on a sex trip died.
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia have died, "says the Russian Federation Space Agency Roscosmos in its press release.
The Gekos traveled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of gecko in a weightless condition.
One male gecko and four females took part in the experiment.
Even though the experiment sounds strange, it was meant to be serious.
The effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs, are only known to a limited extent.
The effects on Gekos can be used to predict the effects of weightlessness on a person living in a longer-term environment, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death of the gecko and the cause or causes of death are determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers crossed into "sex gecko" froze.
The surprise is also illustrated by the fact that fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 have survived the trip without difficulty, and they also gained secondary growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of recruiting a group of jihadists in Syria.
The French authorities informed the Commission on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track the man after he lured a 16-year-old girl with money to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline didn't believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but called the authorities.
The authorities contacted her father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he's from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had been monitoring the man's actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people who are tempted to war in Iraq or Syria also pose a security risk to France.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French nationals or persons enrolled in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from Syria or are currently planning to go to Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team for an extension are at stake when Finland meets today in its second World Cup match with Ukraine.
If an opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine would again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, "says Petteri Koponen.
On Saturday, Ukraine beat the Games in its first match in the Dominican Republic from 72 to 62.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under the command of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter quick guy, but we've been playing against them before and we need to get our standard defense back on track, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in its defeat to the United States yesterday.
We need to rediscover our own strengths.
I can assure you that there will be a normal pack of wolves on the field, "said Möttölä.
The alleged naked images of the Hollywood stars are spreading online - some of them are guaranteed to be genuine.
A number of naked pictures are being distributed on the Internet, allegedly posing as well-known public figures.
Among other things, the actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked camera campaign."
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken these photos years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible effort was made to do this.
I sympathize with everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice calls images under her own name fake.
There are also genuine or fake nude photos in circulation, at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strehovsky and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here."
The football club FC Honka is at the moment in the final place of the League.
The comments made by goaltender Walter Viitala after Sunday's VPS match are a good illustration of the confusing current situation in the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But everything has to be adapted, "Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the fight, especially in the first half.
Goaltender Viitala was not pleased with the bad defense game.
This summer, player traffic has been busy, and that is why the defensemen in front of Viitala have also changed very quickly.
Many young players have also had opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here one day," Viitala blew without naming any individual players.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Mr Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when their teammates are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same lineup twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive end, people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position, "Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after a VPS loss, at the points with the second-last-ever TPS.
There are seven more rounds left in the betting league, so the Espoo people still have time to avoid falling to Number One.
I've never dropped a team in my life, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We will certainly not fall out of this series, "the goalkeeper Viitala said.

The first stores were opened in 2002.
In the Ice Bucket challenge, the participant dislocated his jaw
British Isabelle Roberts was roaring so loud when they poured ice-cold water on her that she damaged her face bone.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken into treatment since she roared for the Ice Bucket challenge, so hard that her jaw dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts was roaring so loud when they poured ice-cold water on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I was just roaring, but when I roared, I felt my jaw getting stiff," he says to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
And then my mom and my sister found out the same thing, and they started laughing, but they had to rush me to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
Video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The perspective of wolf howling (kin): How can the increase in the number of fans be explained?
I felt great today.
This was said by the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played against France at the Maroussi Ball Hall in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about one hundred Finns who cried out to 20,000 spectators in an otherwise empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraine match at the World Cup?
In Bilbao, the number of troops of 100 Finnish fans is eighty-fold.
The Finnish Championships 1995 was the season for the Finnish basketball game.
Men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the door to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising kids like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä's lime line to the final tournament team.
A solution that many people disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from a distance, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
The total number of Finns present at the Athens Games was slightly over one hundred.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
Bilbao has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish competition tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever number there is, it's an unimaginable amount.
Here's some explaining for sports sociologists.
In a global global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys thrive in the world, "says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physical Sociology.
There will certainly be Finns in both Spain and in the volleyball World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
But it still doesn't explain everything.
You know, sport itself has to be attractive.
Itkonen brings sport into popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to see art.
But without success, the masses cannot be mobilized.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team operations were put on a pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sport, where the sacred trinity works: sports media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can orbital species transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball play for hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
The question is a good one, and it is not necessarily an answer that would be very good for the species.
The second school thinks the interest will shift.
The other one's the one who doesn't want the sweet one full of stomach.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series is not exactly interested.
It's a challenge for society in the midst of the drug.
Check on the land of Bottas - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach house.
The municipal government approved the sale of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future there will be a free-time apartment on the property.
Nastola has been monitoring the success of Bottas since his karting days.
He will be seen as a good ambassador to promote Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has been taken over by the Municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition condition, six of which will be demolished by the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas reached his fourth prize ball spot in the Formula 1 Belgian sectionals this year.
He's in the fifth place at the World Cup.
Bottas is a native Nastolan and lived in the Village of his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from the formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Designer clothes are coming, but I don't think they're for the poor.
It is currently presenting and testing them in the current U.S. Open Tennis Competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by the ball people at the airport, but also by the amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players.
He says the shirt helps him monitor his own development and control his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the motorcycle on the shirt and then to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the mockula, which acts as a central unit, is removed.
The fashion house has not given us the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at the price, Tech Times is reporting.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that's invested in intelligent clothing.
California Athos has brought in a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 a piece and the central unit the size of the thumb they require costs $200.

Smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a clever way of saving costs.
He developed a system in which the students of the later annual courses borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling them straight away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to spend it for the whole semester and I stared a sandwich," says Schroeder, 19-year-old, studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his last semester's book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but the students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay far less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which has more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on this area reveal that around a quarter of the books of university bookstores in the past spring were rental books, "says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online shops
In online shops, you can only get a new book for one third of what it would cost in a campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's ninth edition of "Calculus" is recommended for nearly $290, but the book is available at $239.99 from the online store of special books.
Buy Used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn-out appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is available at the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says that he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used by Amazon.com online shop for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the Amherst's College Without Walls University of Massachusetts recommend that students ask their professors whether previous editions can be used in a course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rental
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Take a look at the rules of the rental company, such as the notes, the use and wear of the pen.
Rental, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
It may also be possible to obtain e-books instead of ordinary papers.
These books are sometimes rented to pay for e-book access to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store gives you the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most, because several classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays to compare the different sellers, whatever choice they choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law, recommends using the book ISBN number to find out the price, because it will help you make sure you're looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, "says Gault.
He's the one who learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in the fires as last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Federation (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires so far.
Last year, at the same time, there were 31 burns.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the Association's statistics on fire deaths, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the burns happen in apartments.
Seventeen fire deaths occurred in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses, and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of a home fire safety review.
At least all fire alarms in the home should be operational according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing equipment is easily accessible.
There must also be an accessible escape route from all the premises in the home.
Children should also be told which electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the centre of the city of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke to the demonstrators who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Australian Blue Mountains
Two teenage hikers were raised to safety after being stuck overnight in the blue mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackhead.
The families were worried about young people who hadn't returned home and called the police at 8: 00.
A search party consisting of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and a two-man team was found around 11 o'clock near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were lifted to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have been ferociously united with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to the military spokesman, the gunfire on the other side has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, a Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery hits in the south-east of Ukraine yesterday sank in the morning, says the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border patrol was not sure where the ship was shot from.
The separatists told me yesterday in social media that they shot a ship.
According to Sergey Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Mr Lavrov, however, insisted that the Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw from positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, an immediate ceasefire should be reached in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rain caused the flooding of Malmö and Copenhagen.
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the heavy rains spanked southern Sweden and Denmark.
Flood waters cut off several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars under them.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that it may take time to ease the flood, even though the rain was predicted to stop on Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by the heavy rain and no weather warning was given in advance.
Finnish Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who was on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front affected the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and stable.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France," says Francois Hollande's main supporter
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show his feelings" towards the Socialist President, who is struggling, whose composition of the new government was not approved by the majority of the French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," said Valls, and deserved a round of applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government, despite the controversial 35-hour working week in France, to leave the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, in spite of the debate earlier this week, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister for Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused dissension by appearing at the meeting of the Socialist MPs who expressed dissenting opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the continuing discord between socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by telephone, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the last one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the journalists.
He repeated his party's proposal for the dissolution of the parliament and considered the victory of his party to be certain in early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the extreme right held the top rank in the May EU elections.
According to the opinion poll of the Journal du Dimanche published on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Po, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly see that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Morning Finnish presenters Kirsi Alm-Sierra, Nina Rahkola and Meteorologist Pekka Pouda in the recorded section of the program.
The good morning Finland program last Thursday released a fun video on its Facebook page about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola as well as Meteorologist Pekka Pou are trying to record the morning of the next day's broadcast of the Finnish commercial pub, but the recording does not go very well.
Alm-Raja is confused in his words when he tries to say the word budget, and his nonsense also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their poker game time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow too, "says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pou, 68, worked in the photo office of the magazine, ranked third in a series of potters in 1972.
This is the Israeli Prime Minister, Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in the building of the Builders' House in Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture four feet away.
The light and background were right.
I realized this time, I did it.
From the look of Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, photos of well-known people or events were able to compete.
It is great that other images can also be successful today, as long as there is an idea and visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash photo of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Argument: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than EUR 5 million
Research into the legality of the activities of the Narcotics Unit of the Helsinki police has already cost over EUR 5 million and has required 30 to 50 person-years.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki at the University of Jyväskylä in his doctoral thesis on information technology.
Mr Rajamäki suggests that the enforcement of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology allows multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system whereby information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time allows for comprehensive judicial review.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Vegetable diet includes fish and chicken food"
The picture of a special press release on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Trip School caused a food disturbance in social media, "says Yle on his website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetable diet with school lunch includes fish and chicken food.
Only when meat is on the list will we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old press release left on the wall of the school.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread in social media has led people to send indignant feedback to Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleaning service, says to the General that the note left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Obviously, before I came, there has once been an idea of this kind, which has been discussed with health care in due course.
Every student gets a meal of his wishes, he says to the High.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, pupils are offered a vegetarian alternative only with the permission of their parents and a doctor or nurse's certificate of a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to the General by the fact that young people's vegetarian experiments may leave their nutrition incomplete and the lack of meat or chicken may be a source of astonishment for their parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is engaged in negotiations to purchase its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc.
As a result of the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of USD 6.8 billion, would have access to luxury cruisers and wealthy customers from Prestige Cruises, which would continue to compete against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCLN) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations are not being held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to the requests for comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise from Miami has 13 cruise ships with route maps covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13% from 2012 to 2013, when it was USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates in Miami, sails with Oceania and Regent brand names, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The cruise industry worth USD 29 billion is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise in emerging economies such as China and India.
Companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US share market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the shares of the company since the sale in 2007, which was worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current formation in 2000 following its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo for 20% and the private equity company TPG Capital LP for 8% from the end of June.
The combined North American cruise capacity of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise is 82%, as shown in the registration document published by the Prestige Cruise shares in connection with the issue.
The City Council of Tampere will deal with the matter today.
Animalia wishes to see strong support from the city government for this initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Managing Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, it is time for the delfinarios to end quickly in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a growing perception that the maintenance of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinaries is neither animal welfare nor ethical sustainability.
This view should also be borne in mind in Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinaario is not only an issue of animal law, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Mr Tuomivaara points out.
According to the probability of judgment, the death of the Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for a delfinarium activity to run low.
The death of Särkänniemi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Delfinarium of Särkänniemi.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, to close the dolphins' prison and to start looking at how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
These did not have time to return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins in Särkänniemi will experience even more life than the invigorated concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Protection Union, Animalia, aims to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the context of the ongoing reform of the Animal Protection Act.
This includes dolphinarios.
In support of this demand, Mr Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, will take part in the demonstration today on behalf of the dolphins on 1 September.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on a new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state property" of the outgoing region, "Russian news sources report.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist region of eastern Ukraine should become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The request made by Mr Putin to the Kiev government to negotiate with the Russian-minded rebels as equal partners is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to effectively grant the newly proclaimed Novorosra independence, which will allow it to go to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with State Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's attempts to take back the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, dominated by separatists, which were taken over by separatists in March and April, following Moscow's annexation to the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region "Novorossi," "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of glory before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are an illusion as long as the Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and the government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We need to start extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
Mr Peskov said that Mr Putin's reference to "state property" was linked to greater independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in order to allay the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, "says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, "Peskov says," because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine. "
The Kremlin interim remark, which was intended to correct Mr Putin's' misinterpretation 'of his comments, underlined that the Russian regime dealt with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, in which case it practically invaded an area of which the majority of the population of 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnic Russians and because, according to pre-conflict opinion polls, the majority of the population were in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically power in an area that links Russia with the Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, has a Russian main fleet and commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters which produce products of vital importance to the Russian army.
On 7 June, in his inauguration speech, President Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators - following the new elections - consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the Ukrainian nuclear region for their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to be radically different from that of separatists, perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Mr Putin made his latest demand to the Kiev Government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the separatist city of Novoazovsky, supported by Russia, will be the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area as far as Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel implementing the consolidation of the city of Mariupol. Mariusul, a half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city located between the narrow land area leading to the Novoazovsky and the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further action to prevent future Russian insults in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested further sanctions to be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine re-erupted in unclear circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Yilovaiski region after two Russian armoured divisions and 1 000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 soldiers in Ukraine who were surrounded by Russia in the Holocaust was replaced by 10 Russian parachute jumpers who were imprisoned in the Ukrainian region a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by japanese convoy Keisuke Honda at the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, the first hit was Sulley Muntari and a little later, Jeremy Menez fired.
Laziokin got a tough one at the end of the game, but the goalie Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attacker Inzagh's coaching debut at San Siro's stadium was only half full.
The audience of the match was announced to be 39 000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the naked photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is appalled by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and the naked photos of the Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been swarming since a number of naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to hold a total of 60 naked pictures of Hunger Games Star Lawrence and other superstars such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also pictures of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strehovski and Grecko living in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
