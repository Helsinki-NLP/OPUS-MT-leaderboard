A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The missing persons report concerning the boy who left Western Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life or health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Som at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found in the neighborhood around the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, rampant, tore the end line to the Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued to work in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal king of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo took the lead in all-time goal-maker statistics when he fired two hits on the network of the visitor Shahtar Donetsk for penalty kicks and one for the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his March to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messi, who was on the level with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0 game.
Juventus has stumbled from the beginning in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the Champions League's D-section it started with a 2-1 guest victory in Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus Alvaro Morata ten minutes before the end.
City's attack was bored by the absence of the kneecapped Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also had a hard time against PSV Endhoven in Holland after a 1-2 loss.
It took Luke Shaw, 20-year-old wing defenseman of ManU, 15 minutes to catch up.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the target against the attack cell ManU-pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass of the Eindhoven home stadium ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno was even before the break in time.
The winner of the PSV was Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The goal of the season in the Champions League was launched by the A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria from Argentina who replaced Manchester United's shirt with a PSG doll.
Di Maria broke through right and pulled the ball past Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinburgh Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been put on the list of successful season players.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best reference.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star invader of the PSG, met for the first time his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost in a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for an immediate resignation - the president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the parliament he gave at the end of last month.
I guess during his 25-minute speech, Mugabe didn't realize it was the same speech.
The speech aroused doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit power.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hastened to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's influence on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The request was evaluated by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to get Europe registered more effectively.
According to Mr Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the home ministers' table.
The professor admits that he shot his girlfriend in a 911 call.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for an emergency call with a voice shaking the police into his home and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor told us that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on a white paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," a letter signed by Lamb read according to the authorities.
There was no evidence in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometers to the campus. Police found a professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, who was believed to have been shot by Lamb, who was found dead on the campus.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, said that the university officials were informed of the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal 911 call for some time after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
Scientists worked out the details in both localities, and those who knew Lamb told us about the man. Scientists developed a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to the Gautier police at the Prentiss place of death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Mr Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned in a book written by Mr Lambi, in which he had recognised the "wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he was having a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was under stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's recruitment policy meant that the claim for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University Rector William LaForge said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that there was clearly something wrong with Lamb.
These are the questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lambi, he had taken his own life with a .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, "said Methel Johnson, the coroner in Washington County.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told them that he believed he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started teaching in geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
In the spring, he was awarded a doctorate in education.
One of Lambi's longest-standing friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were in love with him, "said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In the 911 call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there's no record of them being married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the estuary in Gautier's small town.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told me that he had been divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago, and that the couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter now 19.
"He was shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they played together, too.
O'Steen says his daughter writes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the humble restaurant "The Julep Room" outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
There was nothing to deny that something had been wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
Both had a good sense of humor. "
"The deceased professor, Schmidt, directed the first year of seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, professor in English.
He was married, and he had three little kids.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
On the Delta State University campus, there are 900 people in Cleveland gathered at the memorial service in the light of the candle, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night event where the university choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day. "
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting on Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot. It was also specified that although Lamb referred to the emergency call to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that he offers his current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40 000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month and new employees will start in October-December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the trade season is approaching at a good pace and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workers for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The opening night was also of personal importance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royal people to arrive. I noticed there was an empty place next to me. I realized that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me about the coming Back in Time documentary at the trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary is related to the Back to the Future films, and in addition to Fox, the documentary interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" was premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be displayed in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Ban Ki-moon, commented on the intensification of the Russian war effort and noted that there was no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that arms only contributed to further violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in the framework of the UN General Assembly ministerial week.
Mr Ban regretted that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers caused a situation that was impossible to resolve.
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Is Donald Trump serious?
They've been trying to label Trump as a nobody.
They also thought he was a joke.
Some are predicting a collapse for Trump.
In the Republican circles (for the time being) every effort has been made to pull Trump down from the polls.
Ten out of the 11 national gallups give Donald Trump two-digit numbers of support. Some people are already seriously considering what it says in practice about the possibility of nominations for real estate mogul.
But the elections are only in the early stages.
There's no record of Trump being elected Republican candidate yet.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the top of the polls, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidature in any state.
Trump would have a lot of problems with the general election.
External factions such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and have begun to dig up his image to bring him down.
The following recent data show that real estate mogul cannot be ignored by a shoulder scramble:
There's been a full turn in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University Gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures also hold in the Länder where the elections take place first.
Last week at the Quinnipiac Gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's candidacy.
At CNN and ORC Gallup last week, 67% of Republicans said that they were very pleased or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson receives almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, which has a 21% share of support.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for being pompous and offensive. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of real estate mogul suitable for the president.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party meeting takes place first: According to the Quinnipiac poll, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be appropriate to the chief of the military.
According to ABC and Post, however, 44% believe Trump is unable to function effectively and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament to be inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be nominated for the party, according to CNN and ORC polls, four out of ten believe Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: The Republicans have not had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal in the past.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump will beat almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents are divided into different candidates.
The Monmouth University poll at the beginning of September revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican candidate in an imaginary duel would almost always have a larger support group on their side.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and Rand Paul by John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win over Trump with a 19-point difference in an imaginary duel.
A very small majority of those in favour of Trump say that they have already taken a decision to vote.
According to CBS and the latest poll published on Tuesday, just half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's currently most rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Two months ago, following the invitation of Donald Trump in his campaign speech, immigration has been the hot topic of 2016 for immigrants from Mexico as rapists.
Some people are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will deport important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion polls published on Monday by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as migration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes in total.
The Republican Corps wants a fresh face instead of a political fighter. According to the latest poll by ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans thought this.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to an opinion poll commissioned by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activities in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the brink of rage. "
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Since the election, the first appearance of Corbyn in Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The Labour Party Labour's new front shot, Jeremy Corbyn, is due to rise for the first time to fight his strength at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corby will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and Labour representatives will be watching him hard.
Corby has called for less theatre and more facts for a weekly show.
He has also said that he can miss some of the sittings and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the context of the meeting. Corbyn will now be subjected to a parliamentary test following the gathering of the shadow government and the speech made by the Corbyn Trade Union Confederation at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held on Tuesday has received criticism from a number of representatives of the Tory Party, which has also ended up in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said during Corbyn's seismic national anthem, in silence, honoring the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, member of the Corbyn shadow government, stated in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have called on the leader of the party to join the national anthem despite the anti-monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in the Corbyn First Team, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than one-sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent, Robin Brant, considers that the political differences over British membership of the EU and the government's tightening conditions for granting benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Mr Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the shadow government's Minister for Labour and Pensions, Smith, said that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to cut the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has encountered over the past decade as leader of the Tory party.
The Labour Director, who has promised a new approach to politics, says that he has chosen the questions to be asked to Cameron about the 30 000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from Islington North, there are too many clashes in Question Time, and he promises to avoid witty words and throwing dirt and says he will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and young people's challenges.
Mr Corby has said that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, is filling in for him during Question Time, for example when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corby has also thrown out the idea that other people could also get out sometimes and he says that he has discussed this with the President of the House of Commons, John Bercott.
After Mr Corbyn took office in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a puppet-like policy, which was often linked to Question Time, but he admitted that he had failed in his quest a few years later.
Since Question Time was televised for the first time in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the Director's judgment, control of the House of Commons and status, but the critics say that Question Time has become a caricature which needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless to young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way of learning and making money for the group of ex-street children has been found.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home area and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has graduated through the project in the first place.

The pound is getting stronger as British wages rise
The pound became stronger as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
In the May to July period, wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in the United Kingdom compared with the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not included.
The faster than predicted growth was fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1 per cent and its price was quoted at $1.5505. The pound also strengthened against the euro and was quoted at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49% and reached 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate increased by 20% when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
When the deal took place, the two largest breweries in the world would be merged and brands would be placed under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont group focusing on luxury products.
The latest sales figures for Richemont are better than the forecast. The trend in sales was also an upward trend in the key Burberry market in the PRC.
Glencore's share rose by 5% after the mining giant announced its intention to raise USD 2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group, Mondi, were the biggest loser with a 4.3 per cent drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale.
JD Sports's price increased by 3.1% after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would increase by 83% to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Executive Board, raising the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would mean increased purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass-roots campaign against Aldi's fall
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from Aldi's takeover in southern and western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against the Australian invasion of Aldi's $700 million.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in Southern and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media, as well as by organising events like Adelaide.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the Dunsborough ice cream factory Simmo offers tastings in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to regular customers for football league games in South Australia at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Package will organise an annual investment strategy date.
This is a major market, as Southern and Western Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of the IGA stores in Metcash, where the revenue from the cover is higher than that of the IGA network in the Eastern Länder.
Southern and Western Australian consumers are known for their secularity, and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30% and Western Australia 24%, while in the Eastern Länder only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain eats from all operators, but especially from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA traders could be sold for 360 million and Metcash for 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach a sale of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of 13 million dollars in profit before interest and taxes, "Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Cole, although Roy Morgan's recent study shows that IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with market share falling from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, told us at a ceremony in Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on the comments made by Douglas.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the result of the food business of Metcash, which serves 1200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43% compared to 2012.
However, the wholesaler takes counter-measures and makes an annual investment of more than 150 million Australian dollars in order to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworth for hundreds of products per week. The chain wants to support traders in reforming stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food mix of their own brands.
According to Managing Director Ian Morrice, Metcash's price review and store renewal plans are well underway, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association, defends your Thanasi from the Cook Neck.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behaviour instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in a recent case involving Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party of the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavourable light wedge when the bad boy Cyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly after that, in the Cincinnati-Kokkinakis-Ryan Harrison qualifying match, the judge had to fire the competition twice. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the American Open, the chef struck a bat in the field with frustration when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended the chef's coat.
At the moment, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he's fighting Sam Groth in the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I strongly believe that your Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," said Healy.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the US Open. He is not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he has done.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative behaviour of Harrison in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for 19 years, working hard and supplementing the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He trains hard, is in good shape and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged by his own merits. "
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team to an important round starting in heirs. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of the Canberra breeder to the long-term reinforcement of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on matches rather than on the pollemic of Cyrgios," said Healy.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves the criticism he has received for his serious mistakes. However, we are trying to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to make peace for him. I believe that this is best for the team as a whole and for Nick. "
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared the state of emergency, closed its southern borders on Tuesday from Serbia's direction and captured illegal immigrants, in order to prevent the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border, when hundreds of immigrants were piling up in the land of no-man, and the Serbian authorities reacted furious.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between checkpoints in the countries in their tents for an indefinite period of time.
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
While a police helicopter was flying in the air above the colonists, they said "Open the border!" and called out insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them went into protest at the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it did not accept the sending of migrants back to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add damage.
This situation will have to be discussed in Brussels in the next few days and also in other countries. "
The rift between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece are jointly responsible for the flooding, and the hope was raised that by the end of next month or by the end of the year an agreement could be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not express its hope for urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were able to mobilise more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up the judicial process in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migratory flows from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already in place.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finalisation of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottlenecks and a transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are living refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek refuge, a view that is radically different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a criminal offence to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, which also defines longer periods of imprisonment for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a crisis state," Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, informed journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept the military action that is expected next week, and the journalists at the border from the Associated Press have for several days seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's Internal Security Advisor, reported that the authorities have apprehended 45 people who tried to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By harming the fence, people who have crossed the border are now in police custody and are charged with crimes under new laws.
Authorities are working fast on the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday by means of a barbed-wire train wagon.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary when Hungarians opened a point of entry into a small metal container where people were packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a food and drink stand until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton leadership reduced by half to Bernie Sanders according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's turnout is still two-digit in the race for the national presidential candidate of the democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached an end.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the democrats (a decrease of 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (an increase of 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure from the presidential race and his support for the democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for the majority of democrats to tell which candidate they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly and has only a 5% bow to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his lead in democrats under the age of 50, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage over older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in support of Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five-point neck to Clinton in this group.
Around half of the democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if he was elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with minor reservations and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic, too, if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more dispersion in views among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, and only about a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
Forty-eight per cent of democratic voters would be in favour of Clinton, while only 35 per cent of Republican voters would be very much in favour of the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When the voters of Clinton are asked freely to describe why they support his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, the same views are mentioned and the chances of winning the actual elections are mentioned.
The vice president is still weighing his potential candidacy, and 57% of the democrats would like him to join the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When democratic voters are asked for the second most popular candidate for the party, the majority choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and considerably more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton will increase her head start on Sanders, which, with Sanders involved, will be 20 percentage points and will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not go to the race.
55% of the democrats consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden number two is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the real election.
However, democratic voters consider the views on the issues to be more important than the candidates' chances of winning.
The voters do not find any democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
The voters consider the democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and leader types.
Biden is often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered to be the leader type.
As many as 30% of democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15% of Sanders do. 27% cannot say whether Mr Sanders is honest.
In the view of the democrats, the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the voters' own ideology.
For all the features, there is no opinion on Sanders in about a quarter.
When voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as a foreign minister, the majority of democrats say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed their view of Clinton.
There's a difference of opinion among the Americans.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
A majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these features when it comes to the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters throughout the country do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the inquiry, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but like Carson, many people have no opinion of Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, with a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson reaches out to Donald Trump in the National Support Survey
According to the latest CBS News and the New York Times poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took over more than half the votes in the new questionnaire and left the other candidates far behind.
There is still strong support for Trump among the Republican voters throughout the country. The support rate has increased before the debate in Fox News last month from 23% in the CBS questionnaire. According to the survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Mr Carson's support for the report has led to a huge increase over the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all sections of the population, and in the higher education group, he is close to beating Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio split third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voters sample is 6 per cent in one direction or another. The survey was carried out in September.
According to CNN and ORC's latest survey last week, Carson's support is rising, 19% of Republicans are in favour of him, compared to 32% for Trump.
Also in the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was a clear lead ahead of Carson.
In last week's encounter with men, Trump triggered false accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the committee charged with the death of Baruch College freshman.
Almost two years ago, five people were charged with murder following the death of a student in the state ritual in Poconovuori, Pennsylvania.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi (City University of New York) College of Baruch College brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back was put on a backpack filled with almost 15 kg sand, and he had been attacked repeatedly in an attempt to reach a target placed on the other side of the icy field.
Deng is said to have selected a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Psi's department didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, claiming they waited an hour before they took Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told me at the press conference that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the chairman of the department, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the instruments, placing the interests of the department before the health of Michael Deng," said Wagner.
They couldn't revive Deng, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, torso and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the hazing of the department, as at least one student a year has died as a result of the hazing since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The divisions and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County put five members of the committee on trial for the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members are charged with hazing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be held accountable not only to individuals, but also to an organisation that has officially or unofficially approved hazing," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the operation of the Land, and the National Chamber resigned from the activities of the local division.
In this way, the increase in interest rates of the Federal Reserve (Fed) will have an impact on:
Raising interest rates and the boom period in stock markets are fading, the return on securities is rising and the economy is slipping into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it takes for everything to take and how long the effects will last.
In economic terms, in particular, we find in history an indication of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressive in raising interest rates, but not always, and the decisive factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
That is why the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors will not be paying attention when interest rates start to rise, but how long it takes for the situation to normalise.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
In the end, however, market participants may find that any fuss about raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the Central Bank following the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Capital Economics' chief global economists told their customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many people.
However, this does not mean that there is no impact.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how impacts can be reflected in different sectors of the economy:
As seen on the market for about a month now, forecasting an increase in interest rates can increase instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be a stagnation of interest income on capital after the first increase of 12-24 months, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy, a recent study by Deutsche Bank's analyst on the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
More specifically, the market generally sees a sharp increase of around 14% at the time of the increase in interest rates, rather steady for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6%), a normalisation of the situation after 500 days, with an average return on interest of 14.4% after the six equity periods, "says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's chief equity strategic Barron's.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is generally increasing at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a reality in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually helps.
In this case, if the central bank meets conditions that did not exist previously and could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank 's key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase of 118 steering rates since 1950 has only twice been below 4.5% in nominal value.
Although the second quarter of 2015 looks at 3.6 per cent, many people did not think it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5 per cent, "says the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
As regards interest rate increases in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be risks and the question may be whether this situation is different, as Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and the eyes are turning to this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee accepts the withdrawal at this meeting, the futures trade only shows a 25% probability.
"In our studies from 1950 to today, all the cycles up to today have been in a super-cycle, where before the downturn, too, GDP is rising very rapidly since the boom began," the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is already going on 74 months.
Fixed-rate securities have also been unstable in the face of interest rate increases on the market and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately upon the start of the first upward / downward cycle.
At the end of the rise cycle, the revenue drops immediately, "Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that long-term and short-term bonds are getting closer to each other and that the curve is levelling down.
"High-yield bonds are often better off in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, the analyst in Schwab's fixed-yield securities.
It is fascinating, according to Jones, that the market has already adapted to the change in direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the appreciation of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already a number of signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is direct, the credit risk margins have increased and volatility has increased.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market will benefit as interest rates fall and local products start to attract.
The outlook for the indebted multinational companies is weaker, as the strengthening dollar will cause their products to tilt on the global market and the debt to tilt.
"History shows that quality products are more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts report to their customers.
Enterprises with a strong balance sheet outweighed the weak balance sheet enterprises by an average of 5 percentage points after increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better in terms of quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt will lose most, "said Goldman.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally also benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts are divided on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticises the radio station for being too popularized.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor.
Also claims to be a copy of the BBC Music Awards.
For his part, the MP, Damien Collins, accuses the Voice channel of impersonality.
According to a prominent Member of Parliament, BBC Radio 3 is gradually transformed into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The charges increase the pressure on the station to prove that they offer more than that to each commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that the radio channel of the broadcaster is becoming too populist and is no longer very different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel," said Bingham.
The BBC Music Awards, which took place last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"Last year, the BBC Music Awards for the first time seemed like a copy of the BBC Award Gala.
These two examples are that instead of new and different, we simply imitate what is already on the market, "Bingham says.
The Director-General of the BBC denied the accusations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers a much more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3, I learned something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and to making music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works. "
Earlier this year Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station must work harder to maintain public interest, as the British know classical music even better.
Radio 3, however, is not the only strong criticism of entering the territory of commercial channels that has been received by the BBC channel during the consultation of the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damian Collins, a member of the Tory Party, criticised the "The Voice" talent show that the BBC bought from a Dutch producer, Talpa Media, at a price of £22 million.
"The programme is hardly discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the programme presented by the BBC1, which was performed by Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced in a typical way by the BBC.
In addition, Collins insisted on the company to find a hit program in its own garage when it next launches a new series of entertainment.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
Growth in e-commerce is the slowest in August - possibly due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trade grew by seven per cent.
Sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month's growth was slowest than ever.
The online shop was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that November Black Friday can curb the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the conquest of e-commerce has abandoned many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the whole period when sales of online trade have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online trade grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that online commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth to the figures for 2000, it is clear that growth will stabilize over time," the editor-in-chief of the IMRG, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online shop accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
"It allowed more and more people to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, e.g. from the couch.
Now that mobile shopping is more moderate, growth can stabilise. "
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to the normal ones caused many traders' websites to fail.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which makes consumers crowd in after offers, can curb the desire to buy during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per £5 was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of fashion shops on shopping streets.
Mecca bury the victims of crane accidents, the Bin Laden family responsible
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air as the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane that fell on Mecka's Grand mosque.
There had been a gathering of people dressed in white on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the Al-Moissem cemetery.
The grieving convoy went to a pilgrimage where a fallen crane had only one day previously penetrated the roof of the mosque on top of the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia claims responsibility for the accident involving 394 people in the Bin Laden construction business.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in a crane accident in Mecka's Grand Mosque were transported on the streets.
After the fall of the crane, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, of Greater Manchester, was among the dead, who had travelled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were starting their annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, the Binladin Group is involved in the accident.
The English-language service did not report in detail. However, according to the English-language press release, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are headed to the Grand Mosque for the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a press release on the crane accident and no group representatives have been reached for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of failure to comply with the current safety regulations and to cooperate with meteorological experts.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by Mecka's Grand Mosque as part of Binlad Group's gigantic construction project.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi Arab ruling family, and the Bin Laden are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a derelict son who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
A crane accident occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (approximately EUR 250 000) to the families of the victims and to the permanently disabled.
Other injured persons receive half of the compensation.
B & Q boss says cheap Eastern European workforce is behind the phenomenon
The British hire home handlers more often than before, "says Veronique Laury.
The good working people who come from Eastern Europe have become more popular.
More than 200 new Screwfix shops for workmen will be opened.
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, main correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be transferring home hammering and painting work to those coming from Eastern Europe.
It seems that there are few hammering and painting skills these days.
Nowadays, the British are increasingly hiring home handlers to carry out home nickel work, "says the head of the company behind B & Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns the home supply chain. According to her, this phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Sprewfix shops for traders. At the same time, 60 B & Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B & Q stores, as 8 out of 10 purchasing decisions in the store is made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
She said that the demographic trends should be noted, as today more and more single women are also renovating their homes.
"The staff of our stores are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half our clients are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process. "
Laury is one of the five women who are at the helm of the UK FTSE 100 and has also reorganised the company's management team so that there are equal male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost one of its kind, with exactly 50% of its staff being women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," she said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the management team."
The operating profit and sales figures of Kingfisher for the last six months are falling, even though the company worked shoulder-to-shoulder after the closing of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B & Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other workers' federations began to be forced right away, and as a result the country will stand on Friday due to the widespread protest of the workers.
There's a lot of people who think that makes sense.
Why don't we ask him if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad enough?
Even a resistance business has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old good consensus time, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a scumbag would have been a small person's political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of trade unions are not protesting much, but it gives us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in the work of the Ay movement, the brutal solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things seem to be rolling with their own weight, we are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union, as membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organisations do, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Lappeenranta University has a hard savings cycle: target of 8.5 million savings, staff reduced by 130%
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings cycle aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start working negotiations on all personnel, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of some 130 employees.
An additional 2 million will be saved for other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which expects the actual activity to be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university will achieve a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, while funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in business financing on our university is very significant, "says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding is reflected in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British owner Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail service.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, "says Souter.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local transport in the Greater Helsinki region in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter has already reported approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veoli), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe, has expressed interest in rail transport.
United States Central Bank's interest rate decision period
The whole world will follow the meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States, which will be held on Wednesday and Thursday, in which a possible increase in interest rates will be decided for the first time in almost a decade.
A good half of the economists, who still believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates, are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current 0-0.25%, as shown by the survey carried out by Reuters with 80 economists.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates to zero and thus trigger a normalisation of interest rates, "explained Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been in a relatively good state and recovery has brought in billions of additional dollars and slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation which is less rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare itself for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday, 20 May in Central European time.
Whoever shot Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before a colleague was shot later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note asking for forgiveness for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities told us on Tuesday.
In Mississippi Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences, called 911 at about 10: 00 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a man.
Lamb asked for an emergency call from the police to his home.
"I shot my wife last night," he told me, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no trouble for anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give us any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene of the crime and found Amy Prentiss's body, 41, and a note written by Lambi's hand saying, "I'm very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took his own life late on Monday when the police reached him.
University Rector William LaForge said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that there was clearly something wrong with Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb presumably believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt as well. However, the authorities reported on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of a triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss', told us that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lambi for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," he said.
According to the police, Lamb had called his family on Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When the police reached Lambi Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the curriculum vitae on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
The dimmed stars
The last few years have been heavy for an actor (picture left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia and in 2009, his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months due to two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman is sorry to stay on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno when the game was running for the 15th minute.
Shaw got first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
The young man who joined Manchester United's ranks at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now offended by great game grip.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when his leg breaks in two places, he'll be on the sidelines for half a month and he won't be playing in the block.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten off pretty close when the red card was not followed by a penalty kick.
The judge at the match, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can deduce for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-legged, reckless tackle. "
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how crushed I am. My recovery begins here and I come back stronger than ever."
More about: Manchester United Luke Shaw at the PSV game
The British champion has a particular reason to recover from the European Championship in France in June.
"This is a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent. "
Moreno broke his legs playing in the Mexican ranks for the Netherlands, which was piloted by Van Gaal only in the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry, for his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," said Cocu.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
All I saw was a ball heading the other way, so it looked like he touched the ball (Moreno), but I didn't see Luke tackle. "
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm so sorry."
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital following a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, every parent will realize that a child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have not noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the next section, where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to complete the short initial text.
"Needed in a city where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted lives, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," the text says. In 1991, in the version of Dr. Seuss, Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died, Ted had no attraction.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly in line with the plot of Lorax on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "Needs in a city where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of a girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him. Ahne Kerskanen will dispose of the trees and make the Accessories despite the resistance of Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, moustache creature that protects the forests.
A PR mission of this kind, probably of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text was probably from the Cameron district office.
SuperCamps did not comment on it in more detail, but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it's still tough.
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but seeing the defeat of the last 3-0 Test series by the team chosen by England for the tour is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a guest victory.
The side of Alastair Cook may be more inexperienced than the team from three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong - they have no bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no test level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced with Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best of the voters.
A few 50-point fights would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is above all a team player.
The question of how long the Test batter will have the opportunity to make an impression is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground fights, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Compton was the only one who got the chance to play both home and guest games.
The only thing to complain about is that England used Jonathan Trotti first in the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming on the team, and he's a batter, and I really appreciate it.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start the batting shift with Cook, so we can get an extra screw pitcher at the same time as four quick pitchers at the same time, and I'm not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to the top pitcher hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have achieved much in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player before he could start in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup helper, and based on what I've seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistic numbers - an average of 31 points as a batter and 35 as a pitcher - and this may be a long shot, but not many spiral pitchers have shown that they are ready, and the electors decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
Appointment of the Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawardene, as an advisor to the Test Games may be a slap in the face.
This is one of the sweetest men of the species, bringing with it a lot of experience, because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the game of the white ball and brings both energy and merciless.
In my opinion, he has always seemed to be suitable for international cricket, whether his role as a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has a useful intellect.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day matches, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not set a timetable for the match.
And we must bear in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is becoming ever deeper and deeper, even without a pleasant Jeremy 'yes' or no 'Corbynia's choice to lead the Labour Party' or the TUC making a huge mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is going through - although not everyone is an act of their own - and some Member States are tired of the self-righteous British agenda, which includes concessions that cause disagreement and damaging Treaty changes, which they do not even want.
In Brighton, it was decided at the TUC annual Congress that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it eroded social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda, for example.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are hanging out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, capturing themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, returning home and saying that they have acquired allies for reforms.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded British inside the EU tent. "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German prudent Chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it is ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Holland faces a re-election or a replacement in 2017.
His power is fading, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, in Spain again a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them running to help the Selfie British, who could use their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want that either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately make useless comments in the Scottish National Party style in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a setup, and Britain had nothing left to do with the renegotiation."
Europeans know how the British press is hunting and how the EU-sceptic oligarchic press is, just like Tony Benn's work in the 1975 referendum, the result of which was 2: 1 in 1973 for accession to the EU.
Perhaps someone will remember at a distance Boris Johnson, a weasel Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'correspondent for direct EU bananas' in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax evasion, phone hacking and seemingly temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought more or less the same thing about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and for dinner.
In his opposition to the referendum, Miliband was the most blairiak; he agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected; when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was conveniently off the hook.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who was kind enough to pat me on the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have any more time to waste on me.
It may take time, but Corby needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, whose BBC couch he sat on on Sunday.
The official position of Mr Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside Ukip and Tory will probably be able to say yes to this.
That's what Dr. Hilary "Benn but not Benniitti" Benn told me on the radio and on television this week when his inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move by Corby to appoint the rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father had trouble being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television, without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU 'under all circumstances', and Mr McDonnel did not say so, nor did Mr Corby's colleagues and members of the House of Commons, in a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whether Corby wants to pass on the suckling image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. Communication discipline is important in the 24 / 7 era, especially in social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud are smudged.
There is no need to give Cameron a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn's equalisation of EU membership is compatible with the Benite economy and the anti-capitalist past, and discussions are no longer confined to left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea of similarity is a key lesson in dogmatic strife.
There has also been an equalisation of NATO. Tom Watson is adamant that Corby is not campaigning for departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have sceptical voters; why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the British pathetic military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cuts during the Tory regime, which I was reminded of on Monday when the British Influence Security Forum was launched.
Experts criticised the British authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to scientists, the allegations of a state-funded body that the smoking of e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
The experts criticised the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
PHE described its report last month as a "revolutionary and comprehensive review of the results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal's editorial took a "remarkably weak basis" for teeth, on which the PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers in BMJ have considered whether the allegations were based on "rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, European Public Health Professor Martin McKee, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have said: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to Mr McKee and Mr Capewell, the public assumes that the PHE's argument that "the best estimate at present is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results of the research.
This claim is based on one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to harmonise participants' views on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled for the study.
According to Mr McKee and Mr Capewell, support for the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previously independent research was funded by sources from British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, in the report on sustainable operation, the Executive Director demonstrated his support for BAT's public health activities.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged earlier funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for the composition of the panel, but there are many well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which recognise their involvement in the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco manager of the PHE.
According to Mr McKee and Mr Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no undisputed evidence that products are harmful to a large number of products and that they meet their criteria.
However, no links or shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has so far been provided that e-cigarettes can promote smoking by children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider this to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at the PHE, the allegations have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of an addiction to tobacco.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public of what the evidence shows and does not show, particularly in a situation where the relative dangers compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are almost 80,000 deaths related to smoking in the United Kingdom every year and smoking costs public health care £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly provide the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, "says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for programmes which are not carried out by other television stations.
He criticised the BBC for presenting programmes likely to be less accessible to the public at the same time as those of the major viewers of competitors and, for example, on the BBC4 channel.
After Tony Hall, the CEO of the BBC, had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had spent six years trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC will buy formats and send programmes that are clearly part of a competing channel's software," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its offer to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time because it wants maximum support in the future.
If no other channel wants the program, it's obviously ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be financed without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders second, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for that.
I do not understand how this serves the service provided by the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC. "
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He thinks the BBC is looking for good ratings because the company works with ambitious people and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are along the same lines as the former Sky boss, Tony Ball, who suggested with his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC would sell off series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for the BBC Niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where ratings are often not measurable, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "The BBC can say that, in defending its hypocritical missions, it has made special programmes of £4 billion in broadcasting fees, which no one saw."
"The BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
On the subject of broadcasting charges, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is equally old-fashioned in the sense of who gets the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 a year is affordable, but the people for whom it is a lot of money, especially if the BBC is hardly looking. "
David Elstein, the former head of Sky- and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for "information, teaching and entertainment."
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programmes in the current BBC offer - 1% on television and 0.1% on radio - and he adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and turn its mission into a new belief: "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the question of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts on events such as the Proms festival, whose concerts were broadcast only a fraction last year. "The BBC should also join the Alliance with commercial channels to make the entire supply available online," he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogentics
The video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when exposed to ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered, allowing them to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when exposed to ultrasonic frequencies above the hearing range of the human ear.
The sound waves activate motion nerve cells genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More about: Researchers monitor brain activity through light
According to the scientists, the worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new "dubbed sonogenetics" method, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with external stimuli.
Sreekanth Chalassan, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jola, California, told Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Shuttle worms do not normally react to ultrasound. Chalasani noticed that worms, however, begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that progress into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are present in parts of the worms' cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the nematodes with an ultrasound, Chalassan genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in the TRP4 ion channels.
When the modified worms were controlled by ultrasonic sound, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and moved to the worms, which triggered a signal in the nerve cell.
This method is a bit like optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogentics have certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain under study by means of light fibres; however, low-frequency ultrasound sounds easily penetrate the cell so that ultrasound can be directed through the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene and viral therapy can temporarily expose human neurons to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting in certain neurological treatments," said Chalassan.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment on your doorstep!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-gun exhibition video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leg cuffs!
Grape bombs!
Remote tasers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The joyful sound and cartoons clearly reveal that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a parody. Video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British regime's attempt to sell arms to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) exhibition, which is held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in London Docklands.
More on: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
The bus stops and metro wagons also have posters that require a second look.
"Important announcement: are you on the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The notice resembles the announcements of the London metro. There is a picture of the tanker at the end of the metro line.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked to help to close down the weapons fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was displayed at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy Dismalan.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a £6 "advertising space hacking package" with hexagon keys that allegedly have access to about a third of the world's billboards at bus stops.
Transport for London is not a laughing stock of vandalism.
One of the prank ads of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world. Many are moving on to work with protest activists.
One of the anti-arms posters greets users of public transport on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the authors have also done their work without compensation.
The artistic director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, wondered about the absence of exhibition advertising and the empty spot in the ExCEL event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to create a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation will attract more attention. "
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to bring up the trade fair where there is an illegal sale of torture equipment," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture instruments are not illegally traded at our very door."
However, perhaps the most creative gift of the station fair is displayed on the exhibition premises themselves in ExCEL, where exhibitors make great use of euphemisms from their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order from the US military concerning "portable AT4CS RS '.
The product includes "a specially shaped warhead that effectively penetrates the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student apartments
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in barets and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the forced smiles that I irritated, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons I can summarise in eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment house is at its most painful experience and at its worst shocking.
The situation is easy to talk about: tell everyone where you are, why you like Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, character skin, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others questions.
Asking will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your eyelashes are on fire and these people would hand out fire extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
Their own rooms often serve as drinking shops, cinemas and public living rooms, but their own room is also a place where they dress, starting with their underwear.
More about: Don't even think about combining dating and university studies
For the Introducers the university is a tough place
Your own room should be a place to calm down. However, many homes form a social culture, where you walk from one room to another and form lifelong friendships.
A culture like this can be a nightmare for someone who needs a place to recover.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy that I used to date you."
Try to see if one of your students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies conveniently when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, kind of weird thing: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I'm asking you personal questions."
Homecoming treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and with a taste of surprise, they can still have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires you to have reasonable baker skills.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common violation of student accommodation.
Taking one chicken is stealing, of course, but can you pour a drop into your tea from someone else's milk can?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get permission to borrow milk, even if the owner of the can is yanked.
I can understand how annoying it is for someone to steal something from you, but try to handle it as adult as possible, unlike my own student friend, who put detergent in her milk to punish milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make any noise when others are trying to sleep or talk.
Not only because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every other hole digs...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the occupant of the next room to lower the volume of music, because it was 3: 00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally went quiet, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, went to the exam for three hours, left the music to freshen up in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse just moved into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought your college buddy was your future husband first, you'd start dating, break up, see him every day and lose the right to meet your friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the student friend is definitely not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a joyful moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of prank and bullying will be more fluid than one could ever imagine.
A good joke is fun, but one you'll recover from in no time.
Hiding something can be a valuable and funny lesson, but no one's room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door to the second room can be locked and dropped in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach anyone's stuff to the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple of times more.
A racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee - a house designed to be a reception center was tampered with in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee in North Karelia took place in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, this is not about accommodation facilities for minors asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for longer, "says Heidi Luukkinen, teacher of the Evangelical Academy of Kitten.
The windows and walls of the public college accommodation were tampered with racist signs such as swastika, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation rooms, "says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of youth guarantee education at the National School, there were approximately ten people in the building that was the target of vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," says Luke.
There are people from 12 different nationalities staying at the folk college.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors for asylum.
Everyone in the messy building has a "a" status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are studying in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish, "says Luukkaainen.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit which can be issued for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, a briefing was held on Monday for students, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened, "says Luke.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out.
They were suspected of being responsible for at least three men and had been on the road in a light passenger car.
I believe that this is the whim of the weekend evening of the youth, since this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, "says Luke.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been tampered with, and a reception centre has been planned for it.
The case happened last week.
On Tuesday evening, MTV reported on this issue on its website.
The hospital wall had a swastika drawn and written in English "You are not well come."
There's been a police report.
Focus 15.9. 16.02. Corrected by the police for incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The government will shut down the Y-train to Karelia - passengers in their bosom, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raasepor stops running in March.
The news indignated passengers arriving at the beginning of the evening shift of the train at the main railway station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downswing strikes the Siuntians, "said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is growing and people at work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can only depend on political will or lack of political will.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video that she will come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes in the rest of Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be merged into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train services during the following contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be abolished throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be adopted by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström, a Siuntian, considers the state's train cutter to be short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
Then you get remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporans and Siuntians because it is fast and overtakes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling beyond the city area by train.
"It is very sad for those who have to replan their journey," he said when he was in pain with the Y train.
There's going to be a little relief.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach, replacing the Y train in the Helsinki Region traffic area (HSL), which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for local authorities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the various options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million euros per year for the Y train, of course much more than this.
The R-line on the main line is missing two stations.
By contrast, the number of train shifts will double in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed down from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
On the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu will decrease train shifts.
More than half a million journeys per year are made on halted mountains, while the total number of journeys in the traffic purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million per year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the capital's timeliness book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work "Capital" published in 1867-1894, writes in a book published today entitled "The state of play of the capital of Marx."
"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and penetration of all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and fictitious capital have proved to be amazingly far-sighted.
The book's author list, based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase, also includes Professor of Aalto University, a respected financial expert, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
But the former Managing Director of the Institute of Economics and the Business Delegation is not Marxist, is it?
Oh, no.
Korkman on the phone tells me that he doesn't think Marx is a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the world is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too many conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism, "Korkman says.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are talking again about the interests of Marx, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand a big picture, a changing world as a result of a technical revolution," Korkman analyses.
But what the government is supposed to decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
In his mind, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
And yet, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskians and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated each other even more."
Today the debate is more diverse and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should familiarise himself with Marx's mind as with other classics," says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, "says AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
In the Sri Lankan civil war, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, the military's major attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report charges torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed us to push social media.
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the high school texts of autumn, which most had English.
More than 16,000 candidates were tested for their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a paper on social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to ask ourselves whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the website manager.
The headline was "Dear Agony Aunt."
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian resting chair.
He needed advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
A total of four subjects had to be selected.
"It was the hardest one," assessed the third topic in Porvoo, the English lecturer in Swedish high school, Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth one, Lybeck said it was all right.
It had to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test allowed you to answer questions about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
Autumn's writings will continue on Friday, when the test will take place for another resident, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In high school schools, the experiment is organised normally, i.e. it is not affected by the employees' demonstration.
The matriculation examination panel will ask candidates to find suitable access in time so that they can make it to the trial.
Additional time may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
A store was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning in Oulu, a store was robbed in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had a small amount of money to catch.
This is being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the decision to cut the government will be blocked by the police on Friday in Helsinki.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STT unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm functions and other police activities, but also to ensure the flow of a massive protest.
The roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles during the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, the direction of the west starting from Mannerheim Road.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it looks like enough.
I'm not gonna take a stand on a cop's industrial combat business.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact numbers of patrols.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," says Kujala.
The police suggest that you avoid private car driving in the city centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning to early evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Iron Road Market.
The buses are basically out of range.
The rest of the way must then be taken to the demonstration site, "says Kujala.
It also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a cop's point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these big public gatherings, is now partly self-evident.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the protest to go smoothly.
Violence is ordinary employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in Finland on Friday.
Friday's protest is exceptional in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, "says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisiainen, Professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Well, it's no wonder the ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't do that, it would raise its hands in front of the government, "she says.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is not in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that are really trying to get the ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, there is also a place to look in the mirror on the ay-motion.
The mirror is needed, for example, because there is certainly no support for all employees on the way to Friday's demonstrations.
What is now new is the sharp division that the protest will bring about in the group that the AU would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered in different parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, "says Murrostorstai, Siisainen, which was held in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (central) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse off than in the days of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, "says Siisainen.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing, despite what the Finns have said.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement in the days of the blitz.
On Friday, several thousand demonstrators are expected to be present.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
About 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, there have been quite peaceful demonstrations in the Finnish AU movement - even though the methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, "says Siisainen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to wear pig shit.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electricity strikes in the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the Metalmen strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after the strike lasted for seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Murrostorstai, 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people met in front of the House of Commons, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, to express their support for the work.
Firefighters were on strike for three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were hit by egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers poured tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and smoke hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
In 2007, he threatened a strike and a mass retirement of nurses.
In the end, the threat of mass redundancies accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors were on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced strike" was the slogan of the doctor on strike in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and led to a lively debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched on behalf of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament building in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police are investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in finding out the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and primary responsibility are at the scene of the incident in Austria, "says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Kähradio, who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its managing director is a man of foreign background, approximately 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A rich smuggler's king, a violent boat driver, a classy missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist working at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and the book they wrote about Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the tentacles of trafficking in human beings, put forward solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are headed there to spend the summer.
In terms of their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as it is only 120 kilometres away from the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for fishermen to transport people.
That's what Emir has been doing with his blue 10-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If you fill the boat, you can fit 40 people.
After one trip, Emir makes about 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisian people wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as it takes.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if customers run out of money, that is their problem.
We're leaving for the water at midnight with an extinguished lantern.
The first night you drive away from the islands, then you stop, wait the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is going on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat them to death.
He says in the book that when the police saw him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The quietest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's got to beat up his fellow countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good, his starter engine is running its last few days, and he's seen his best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 km southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family are staying in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private apartments, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally entering the Bogovaða region, the great hub of human smuggling, people are dying tired.
Goran's people are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are the Syrians, he tells us in a book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly goo-goo all the way.
For example, a price of EUR 300 will be agreed first, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice man with a good heart.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, "he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than others and that he is only charging EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 300 miles away, most of it comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a pleasant annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shakes away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where there are many believers who have escaped from the Congo, and a small centre to help the Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are being transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He shines his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and to move on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the five numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully and slip among the traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, you must tell them that you are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that you have had to flee your home with violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
That will help the missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: to the asylum application procedure, to the NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: it costs about EUR 100 to submit an application to the Ugandan police force, about 150 documents to the humanitarian organisation, and the migration process, for example, in a European country, between EUR 4 500 and EUR 7 000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people on trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan driver living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving off the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tom picks the right truck, we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not to Holland, for example, and cut off the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but it's more expensive than that.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in aluminum foil, the same one they wrap around a roast or an oven potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who was hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene in the hope that the driver won't pick up any stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The infamous Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury vessel scam: Turkish ports rent pleasure boats supposedly to take American or European families to a few days' tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghan citizens who are being transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must get on the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury vessel trip after the cost.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, landlords and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer season, transport takes place at least hundreds and Küçük makes millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 apartments he rents through shell companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.

The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In a book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published clippings of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in state of the art and ran for the second best time in the tryouts.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he stormed into the front and defended his lead in a manic run.
But 150 meters before the goal, his powers were exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, "says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of having money to have sex with strange men.
He also convinced his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he missed the kind of adrenaline spikes he'd been getting when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's statistic number one at 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic finals.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straight-back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Association have been twisting the whole summer and autumn from last year's athletes' agreement.
Although the alliance has offered Northung a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for many world champions and Olympic champions.
As a result of the contractual dispute, the Norwegian Association of Skiers decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision received thanks from the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northung is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the national team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the alliance has given Northung economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
Northug published his own press release on Tuesday, in which he assured us that he wanted to exercise in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as at the World Cup and the Olympic Games afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in his career, including two gold medals.
Last winter, he was a member of a team in Falun that won message gold.
Shining day for roasting translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Turkeyday 25.9, there will be a series of tricks in different restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Bake Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food know-how and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of a high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention of the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurant Fonds and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the restaurant in Old Town will take part in the Shield Day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organisation, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhakoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Office and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the former garrison of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure in the region during the crisis period, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Isolliskotkunta Oy.
Kauharoki magazine explains that, according to a private individual, placing the reception centre in the same building structure would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Airfield School, the effect of which has not also been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been taking place over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport in Kauhava airport.
This issue has been discussed with the Minister of Defence, Jussi Niinistö (p.), and Arto Rädy, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the intended place in the former military area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava dealt with the matter of the reception centre last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö will comment to journalists at night after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties in his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern for managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the Baltic Sea region.
So much hope for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tense situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Mr Nielsson, the issue of NATO was also raised in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles shall be allowed in the area.
Underground and track drivers all Friday in a demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from morning to night traffic.
The Association of Railways and Subways told the STT this evening.
Most of the Alkos close for two hours, including mail closed
Friday's protest also disrupts Post's services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the points of service in the mail are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are carried out despite the strike.
There is also an effort to deal with catering and hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can find information about the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Alkhas close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11: 00 and 13: 00.
Pam has also called on the workers of the grocery trade to participate in the demonstrations of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko will tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with the help of supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, any closure of individual stores is not yet known.

24-hour crèches and groups of mentally disabled children and children with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of mentally disabled and autistic school pupils are organised normally.
The National Education Agency promises to keep you informed of any changes in activity tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Mr Sipilä, there is a need for a wide range of channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in Parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle's channels in the future.
If any other channels report as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Mr Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech for citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä's taking a big risk.
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television speech will not tell us more about the government turning inwards.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more firmly into its own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions?
Reminds me of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The means of communication of political decision-makers are not a matter of announcement in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agendas are not included.
Koivusen says that TV talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Are there any more of what we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old ones, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this sense, too, we are taking a risk if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a messenger of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general line.
Sneaky, cunning bet.
In the forthcoming speech by Mr Sipilä, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher points out.
In the evening you should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where not, says Heikki Kitti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Six, the TV speech is a cunning move by Sipilä, because this will allow him to bring out his own view without the gravel sounds.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no more specific questions can be asked.
Six says it's very important for Sipilä to appear on TV - the currency sweat, the hands trembling.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from the situation if the government were to inform you about something, because here you are talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do on a regular basis (President Barack of the United States).
Very exceptional.
Erkka Railo, the political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the public.
He said that there has been no such thing for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, "says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is the way the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against the government's actions.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says that Sipilä could address the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss it.
Antti Rinne (sd.), President of the SDP, says that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon to be six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inner Finland also confirms the case to the Evening Press.
The kid went out to play around 4: 00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, they couldn't reach him anymore.
My dad thanks everyone who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish-background free fighter, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a very strong speech against young people's street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional fights in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed with the youth fad.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick people in the country, sit on top of the other one, and hit them blindly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people on the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Helsinki Police Commissioner, fighting videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of these individual cases.
A little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate things I don't like either.
Things are pretty bad for you guys anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK's position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STT on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STT proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Federation of Staff Representatives (STT) announced that it would present to the government its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the proposal will be approved by the government if the SAK, STT and Akava are all behind it.
However, it would require the SAK, the largest employee organisation, to soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a narrow comment on the subject on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
He said that the SAK was looking for solutions to "open up the labour market" and that instead of enforced laws, agreements between active parties were needed.
Mr Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä cut off negotiations for a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity leap.
Comment: The big protest is threatening to go, "It feels a little funny to shake your fist"
It does seem a little funny to shake your fist, if you already have a make-up paper written by Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from one side to the other in the employee camp.
Is it the intention to call off the government or to settle with it?
On Monday, the Federal leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred for the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being caught.
The threat spread through the headlights as well.
The teachers' union, OAJ, threatened the closure of schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the O.A.J. cancelled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the Confederation of Workers' Unions (STT), appeared conciliatory.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity cut, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle).
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder (Kok), was in a hurry to announce that his agreement was already ready.
The SAK office didn't hear a peep at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to reconcile when the federal leaders told the country to stand up on Friday just Monday.
At the end of the day, however, Mr Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions for "opening the labour market lock."
In order for the joint presentation of the employees to take place, the SAK should agree to a 5% productivity leap target.
There is no wonder that Palolan SRTT is well-connected with the government of Sipilä.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ihaus, Director of Social Impact of the STT, was previously a special assistant to Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi, Prime Ministers of the Centre.
Palola therefore describes the government's ability to act as a member of the board as having improved.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost from the Finnish stands, whose foreface is the ACP's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it feels a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Additional information about Lyle's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, thought that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly began, in which Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Mr Naryshkin, on the European Union's list of sanctions, to appear at the meeting - something that the President was able to remind journalists of.
It was our assessment that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed by the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Mr Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he had also been denied access.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Mr Naryshkin.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation entered without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued his Finnish stings by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolia leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation, leading the meeting in Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The Tapper and the Clave will continue the bull days in Hakaforest today, while both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real goal party in Hakaforest tonight.
Tappa went to Kuopio last night to drill for a 3-2 overtime victory over KalPa.
The rise was manly because last season's silver group was at its worst two-goal loss position.
The lock's Tuesday was a little more humongous.
Blues, who started the Raunismen 'spoils in a narrow way, was visited by a round zero point, and also by a loss figure of 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Clave-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates positions on the club's website.
The killing has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Syrians.
In fact, in the last two periods, the killer has dropped out of the final series of the Clave.
Both times, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by the side and by.
With the exception of goaltenders, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The two cashiers who rejected us both yesterday are going to get a flute shift today.
With the goal of Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan ZApolski.
View: A terrible play running in the ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote to head coach Rautakallio an inappropriate sequel, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a film called Rocky, in which he himself played the leading role.
The underdog sensationally put up a heavyweight for the world champion, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's opening night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden pot patch went on to amaze everyone in the Finnish Championship finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but resilient underdogs like Rocky.
There was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the irokees.
Toivola became blonde.
JP Jalo, the great TV reporter, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that the novelty work of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sportsman for aces has built a pot of spades on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
The Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Tale into Sean Connery.
The Iron Tale is as clumsy a lead artist as Connery was in the original of 1976 in Toivola's script in Rocky.
There's no Rocky in the iron tank but a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Throne does not include barging and squabbling.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Ases tackled Tappara in the head of Jere Karelia.
He got 2 + 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Thunder put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play for us are the ones who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to the ace puck, the hot Iron Dull rained after the game to the people of Satakunta.
The ace team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and troublemakers.
There are practically no key men of the best game age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the skill deficit.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's under the surface.
The Year1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in becoming a sports manager in Toivola.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The aces' balance in the three league games of the season is equal in number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laugh.
He has been married to the former bass player and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga's first acting under Tuukka's guidance.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanna made us beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Cricket is stepping up and supporting his son, even though his father Risto (represented by Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two of them have come a long way.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little color.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become Finland's largest band.
Back in the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really sad.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some kind of intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that he had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before his movie plans.
But sometimes the stories of the parents have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his youth was completely different from Tuukan, known as Heinola's notorious skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the movie.
At the most, she could have been secretly attracted to him.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuukka over the last 10 years, the big joint project doesn't scare him.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often intends to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, simply asking which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive play film
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The next part of the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be Finland's most expensive play film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation that is under way will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over EUR 100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time is tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he's gonna tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of between 8 and 10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor too.
The film could, however, be crammed into 100 million because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no loose end.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Hillbilly or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts.
The trendsetters' breasts have recently been decorated with large logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the label of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sporttius has become a real fashion mega trend, and so have the old, familiar sporttikaupunki characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wave.
And as has been the case so often, the line between funny and trendy is thin: if something is already a hillbilly, it becomes ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the mundane fashion in which trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of grey elementary college, they're putting on the top of the closet that's already buried in a sweatshirt with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' recognizable track sweats, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
The beginning of the edge of the jeans is now a cool detail for the Calvin Klein logos in the underwear.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing is at stake.
Would you be willing to show me the logos in your dress?
A Russian politician published proof that I didn't get stuck in a tank for hours!
It was claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
Over the past few days, the Russian media has been hearing colorful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency has had to remove the large Zotov tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of the armoured vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on those images, it is not about getting stuck or angry.
That's a load of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Prakda.
I didn't get stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was so interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I definitely intend to visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else kept repeating.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and rosy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged obstruction have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started with the Bloknot.ru case, where Zotovin was told that he was storming out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to finally shoot everyone around him if he can't get out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition gave their views on the event.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply tarried when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator to Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknott.
This is the favorite piece of interior bloggers.
The Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) of the Architects' brothers, the Lassen candlestick from 1962, looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
Architectural brothers are known to have worked on the shape of the candlestick for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was first introduced only to the distinguished gentlemen's dinner guests.
The Kubus candlesticks are made by the family company by By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of reputable brothers.
The candles are made by hand in Holstebro, Denmark, in the form of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
You can get it in black, white, nickel and copper.
The candlestick is topical right now and is suitable for a wide range of homes.
It's been a favorite item for interior bloggers in particular lately.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been taken.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, the water is pumped either for re-use as process water or channelled as authorised through the surface casting field into the environment.
The estimated bleeding rate was approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
It was the only material that leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuopämäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely in line with the views of the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation was pushing Finland for comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppämäki, the chief economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
There is a lot of complacent message in the IMF's assessment of government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, investments in infrastructure, Kuoppamäki says to Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to have an economic growth of 0.4 per cent this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new economic forecast, Danske expects growth to remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, "says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few per cent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, starts work on Wednesday, "Nintendo told on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessed by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as the strong inclusion of Nintendo in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of the traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are arriving in Finland alone.
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear each year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is this the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under the ground in a year? - In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made to a single minor in Finland.
Nine of them went missing.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, "Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to deal with the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were closed because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, "he says.
Is it growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a single minor.
There are still no overall statistics on missing minors for asylum seekers this year, but the number of minors is therefore well known and has increased considerably, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to people who have a reverse decision?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "black market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Mr Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister for the Interior, Petteri Orpo (Kok), has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Council of Ministers of the Interior, reported on practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector, who has lost his ability to work because of illness scenes, is now on the market.
Nina Mikkonen, married to Mikkonen, sells devices that were once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The first news about the online ad was the online magazine Iltamakasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has fallen under technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that you'll find someone interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking to IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkosset are trying to move out of their present home in Thurskylä.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, "says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use of TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent brain attacks that a man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's real life work was archived as early as the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to collect films and other material from Myrskylä with boxes.
Transport threatens to pore worse than we thought: Metro and tram can stop all Friday
Today, metro and tram drivers decide whether to expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stand by metro and tram traffic only during a demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon it will be resolved whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief trustee, says that the threat is great in the field.
The cutbacks on night and shift tickets are killing the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise resistance.
Mr Hirvonen says that standing up for the whole day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will virtually be at a standstill.
According to VR's records, trains don't run Friday between 6: 00 a.m. and 6: 00 p.m.
On Friday, there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6: 00 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the depot.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday from 3: 00 a.m. to 3: 00 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the leadership, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus shifts are scheduled for Friday.
Wage and salary earners' organisations will organise a major demonstration at Rautatientori in Helsinki on Friday from 11 a.m. to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas. His teacher thought he was a bomb on his own.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered the homemade watch she brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was introduce his electronics hobby to the proceeds.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found that the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The case took place last Monday and Mohamedia was punished for three days' compulsory leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether it is yet another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is shaking - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism made by the right-wing press has also been shared by the Members of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has been an insult to the people, who thought it was a Labour Member of Parliament, Kate Green, in a radio interview with the BBC Broadcasting Corporation.
Green thought Corby should have gone along with the song.
Yesterday's memorial ceremony was a tribute to the battle of British air force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party, in its official statement, defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corby) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement underlined.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the Labour ranks.
In particular, there are those among the MPs who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Today, for the first time, Mr Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron roam on Twitter for the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister treferred in his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a week of family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three kids with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went into the house for a checkup and found the Short family dead across the country in a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Minnetonka is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com. for nurses.
In 2014, in the interview with StarTribune Short reported that there are four million different visitors per week.
I've had 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was seen in the fact that the Short family bought a hilarious house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on a property site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also enough garage for eight cars.
The trial is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Asieve Test Prep, offering various preparatory courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to the Asieve Test Prep, the comments that slandered the preparation courses had not been removed from the Short site and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffees.
In addition, the owner-trio was awarded the Finnish horse owner's prize for the month Hippos.
This is great, Loiri comments in a good mood on his honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the Successful Horse will get Loir to work with him in full peace of mind.
Pekka rules and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut the fuck up, Loiri.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star - "The greatest donation of all time by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million a year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be given the hospital's name-bearing lobby space.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
One year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the necessary PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop tonight - only bikini food and an apron on top
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a halibut and now a wife's cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sociable and the hungry.
It's Metro.
You can order a wife or husband at the Ore no Yome (Finnish wife) café in Tokyo for the evening.
We're talking about a waitress pretending to be the wife of a client.
The "spouse" will be selected from the list before entering the café and he will prepare and serve the food.
The wife is up against nothing but an apron and a bikini, and the husband is in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the candidates for a wife, always on what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: attacks against the security of cars began to be armed.
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in this field, "says Intel.
The Board is made up of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections with the aim of standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report based on the results of the ASRB study.
The international ICT research and consultation company, Gartner, estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, "says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can consolidate best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important element in the design of each connected vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as if it were rising on the moon.
Finally, the car is beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt auto show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS is accelerating with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting by Finnish, and it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, though when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell us in his release.
The favorite Kia introduced two new features to the Frankfurt car show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two new Finnish ones.
The Sportage created by the new European Design Director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than before.
The wheelbase and the exterior dimensions have come in one inch here and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but it has been added to 177 turbo of 1.6 litres of horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to sales.
It will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with improved driving characteristics, lower noise levels and better equipment.
The first step is to get the Optimos equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu came back to the stage... flashed in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue suit has an impressive, open neck opening.
The costume presents beautifully the scatter waist of a singer star.
The size is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who became a mother has been able to lose the weight by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn a year.
The singer released his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, "the singer says.
Chisu will be publishing his new album called Polaris in a few weeks' time.
The new life situation has inspired us to write new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people are going to find my new album, Chisu is going to think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astonishing again.
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives one topic after another.
He shows his pregnancy stomach and chest bras in a very sexy outfit, last night at 1: 00 in the American time, when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the husband's Kanye West gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity dress, he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week's Friday, when pregnancy was on display.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model, Manon Leloup, wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speating Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar brought together the six hard truths of Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the last season you would have written in top designer costumes, the new season will start again in Casting.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with the bad guys.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for years with a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are more stressful than anyone else.
There's not just one kind of weight.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop a kilo, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks run out, the difference is a bit of a bitch.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just about showing off clothes.
Models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in a model's work.
The models for the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently hosting fashion weeks where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apilanta musician in the film.
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wironen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to see the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in that group, so I think it's all right if I just learn his style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
The man who's piloting the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play the role.
The punk-maneers come naturally to the man.
Stars, in the punk show of the stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw their first taste, as well if they've ever been to our shows.
Our performance has never been so cute, but we always go to the full.
The leading actors in the "Teit Beautiful" film directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna in 1993-2004.
The core group of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is represented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
Drumpali Sipe Santapuk is played by Teppo Mainer, singer Toni Wurosta Tatu Sinasalo Basist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to implement for the film.
The Scrooge, previously seen in the moustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to silos and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to wonder over the past few days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it at all?
There is no need to force the matter, as a member of the SPR crisis group, the psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children and not allowing them, for example, to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be kept spinning around in their minds and distressing, "he says.
However, if the child has come across television news about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a debate on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child is closely following their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Bigger children are likely to run into a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It's good for parents to bring it up with them if they're wondering about the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe place or a unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety wherever possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermouth-hitting Ball Flash difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to sharpen Apila's ball salama in the middle of summer.
It only rained victories and second places until the end of July in Tampere there was a collapse.
Because the stallion froze completely, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protégé time from the vet.
The explanation for the exhaustion was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not a less severe disease, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Ball salama had to exercise light, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was in Turku in record time another SE mare after Tarunälä.
The Spallsalama of Apila was very pressurised by the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the small deflection at the end was understandable, "says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a difference to the stallion.
The horse's hymn must have moved on from there, and hopefully it would have stabilized as well.
Apila's Ball salama has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not funny, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, on the other hand, the stallion has been cut off by such a lightning bolt that the adversaries have been amazed.
In short speed, the rivals can't handle the Ball salama, which even has warm-blooded rides.
The wishes of the North are a peesy run in Vermo.
But the difference is how the Spallalama of Apila agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you leave, and you could stick a needle under the boom in the truck and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than Turku's departure.
Apila's Ball salama can also come out of the bow when he's in shape, and we're going to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be able to be deleted - but not all of them.
Apple intends to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, "says Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed.
In Apple's iPhone you can find a set of programs that are relatively few to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Lehkioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart clock owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area slowed to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, as reported today by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in the prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% forecast a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation stood at 0.2%.
The so-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the EU-28, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise amounted to 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, from the euro countries.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU Harmonised Index of Price Index.
The inflation rate in the euro area is still persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a 2% price increase over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, and the Central Bank will anticipate its release at the beginning of September in its new inflation forecasts.
The US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after Fed's central bank takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in financial markets, the downturn will start before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he might start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession will be able to press on at its fastest by next autumn and in the course of the financial markets before it.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets function as they have done in the past - and if they react to the tightening of Feb's money supply as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the strategy of the London market survey of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international clients last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Feb's interest rate increases.
In addition to their historical observations, they will examine which key economic and financial variables are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rate increases - and what the consequences might be.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession.
The leaders who decide on Feb's monetary policy and its current stance have been suggesting throughout the summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for over nine years can happen this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Feb Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called "Fed funds' steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but at a time of exactly two years, of small increases in interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a world-wide doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically happened since the previous interest rate increases in Feb.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and more harsh than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Since 1950, and in some cases since the beginning of the 19th century, Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turmoil of financial markets.
Feb's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact are being reported by them since the 1950s.
The first increase in interest rates has reached a peak of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Feb's interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, Fed has in turn increased and decreased its steering rate by a dozen cycles of different sizes.
Each time there has been a deviation from some of the others, and times are relatively limited in the analysis, so it is unlikely that any certainty can be drawn from the effects of the subsequent increases in interest rates.
The strategies therefore point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably identified, even by decades of research.
However, three factors which have led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power are well known:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks and growing the next one at the same time.
(2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive debt in different parts of the financial and real economy increased further as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy was created.
(3) In particular, the low-cost debt financing, which was almost unstoppable in the financial sector, increased most of the financial markets' main price bubbles from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities in their economic history.
It is unlikely that there will be a very severe dispute either that the financial markets, which were raised to the heights by increasingly complex debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when Fed and the other central banks last drove interest rates upwards.
The underlying financial structures, as well as the valuation bubbles, were not able to last more than a few days after interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not speculate on what is going to happen next, but give reason to think, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they are now even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been cheap as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now in various parts of the economy there is a much heavier debt burden than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity that has been issued more slowly and cheaply from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has dampened key securities and assets to their highest cost, whether at the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
In addition, they note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession in the way it has been in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks of financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its money supply.
Perhaps the image of the future of Albert Edwards, the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it might seem.
He has been preparing international investors for the following full translations by Feb for a good time:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it will be time for Fedi to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE raids.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which makes computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP's corporate services sector, "says the company.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company dedicated to business sales, and HP Inc., a company dedicated to pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off expenses of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 over three years.
HP intends to relocate its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the tax havens company
According to Mr Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner, has acted as a member of the board of the tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board of directors were appointed as Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner remains officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he has submitted a resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a letter of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed time frame, "Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Sul, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-level ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelian-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company received a request for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, "Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a business-run reception centre opens
In Otaniemi, Espoo opens its first reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 persons per week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
Luuna Oy is operated by Luona Oy, which is specifically active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STT is preparing an alternative labour market tightening package
STT is starting to prepare an alternative package for the tightening of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to see other employee federations involved.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists on a break from the organisation's administration.
Mr Palola felt that the Economic Union (EK) was not prepared for discussions.
The economists of the STT have calculated that the change security contained in the government's competitiveness package costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party is terribly excited to have a conversation if you're on the receiving side of a one-to-100 relationship.
Palola: The negotiating relationship has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, cutting Sundays is a sore place for the staff member's organisation at the STT airport.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is implementing part of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, SCT is not warmed up by the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the present SDP.
Wage and salary earners will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the labour blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of illness is cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The emphasis is on the fact that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and that the aim was not to strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, commends the announcement by STT of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Mr Fjäder, STT is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined for a longer time in Akava.
Mr Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Mr Antti Palolan STT explained earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it had been preparing for a long time its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive edge sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, "says President Sture Fjäder.
Mr Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to Akava's line, as has been done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
Together we are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, "says Fjäder.
The Bureau of Akava will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Viva's bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05 p.m.
In the run-up to the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers made a number of radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho made a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train operators' strike with a television speech.
Single phone calls, monarchist stuff.
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day about what should come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said: "Mr Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss it."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja from the SDP condemned "the monarchist style: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it."
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is the fear of @ juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Treasury, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented live by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lylly, and the CEO of EK, Jyri Häkähäman.
The public has been criticised for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, a line in the news by Yle's Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
♪ Like us in the time of the Oaks ♪
The speech has also aroused grotesque mockery.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be served in good time, the children will be combed and dressed in their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest lump, and my dad's trying on his tie.
At 9: 00 a.m., the TV will be silenced like the old days, "writes Saku Timonen, the blogger.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens who are drawing up amnesty laws for other tax evaders, while at the same time telling the people that they are forced to cut when the state is out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's posted a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the debt and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan which, after some time, would have allowed Al-Assad to withdraw from power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in just a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral debate: no arms to the opposition, no direct contact between the opposition and Al-Assad, and the renunciation of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember in an interview with Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment.
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaari said that there were no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but they said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all agreements with which he would remain in power.
The former head of the Middle East branch of the British Foreign Ministry, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said because, in his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep control of one of Al-Assad's supporters.
♪ A stream of refugees ♪ ♪ For what we've done ♪
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, around 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Seekers has pushed them to Tornio
The Centre for the organisation of asylum seekers, designed by the Government for Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the city center in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Intoppinen, Vice-President of Tornio City Council (left), this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on it, he will make it clear to the STT.
36 delegates from 43 were present at the debate.
The organizational center was opposed to 13 delegates.
You could expect the decision to be positive, "says Intoppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received a contact on Monday and a rapid response was made.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be able to join the community.
The expert has gone to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work even in that sense, "Nousiainen says.
Mr Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (mid-term), halving the holiday money in public would only cover part of the calculation of the labour price sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such an option.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the labour market blackmail announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
Mr Sipilä felt that halving the holiday money would be a means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the cuts planned by the government for Sunday allowances.
The social partners could agree among themselves to cut the holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements rather than in law.
On Wednesday next week, the Board of Directors will report to Parliament on the blackmailing of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Mr Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then be on the move, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for these things, if there is a will, Sipilä did.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of finale and helaThursday into unpaid days off without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is reduced, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation by trade unions, which has provoked strong criticism.
In addition to a major demonstration on Friday by wage and salary union organisations, political strikes have been announced by a number of trade unions.
Tohmajärvi council approved sahlahalli warehouse expansion
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the extension of Nordic Koivu Oy's hangar or sahlahalli warehouse, but slightly grumbling.
The criticism was due to the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally mentioned.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little puzzled that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting Erkki Ikonen, the technical director, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the local area.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) argued.
A place for the language of Karelia in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous firm stance to bring street name signs in Karjalainen to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of upholding the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not proclaim to be the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastward smokescreen dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre in the Karelian language.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth being open to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of all Finland.
Both of them can very well be used for a wide range of marketing activities in the province.
Disconnection of trains cuts the regional vitality
The cuts in the train connections will hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport links have a direct impact on the regional economy and competitiveness.
And it does affect the fact that we can live and work here at all, "says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, the extension of which has also been mentioned several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not reduce our chances of coping with government measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of the connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services there are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland because of the poor transverse connections.
At present, about one-half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, around 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
A voice of gravel came from the mouth of the river to the battle of Siu
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the regional Siun Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel is one.
The City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) at the Monday meeting of the Board of Directors proposed that the entire project should be abandoned, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains will be less frequent.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains is left out, but still five times a day you get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
These reductions are the result of government austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely abolished.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbing up the roof who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketotie around 6: 30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It didn't stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateurs' mast next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
The result was that other people were running away and the passers alerted the rescue services to help with the last safe return to the earth on the roof of the drawers.
Variation in FedEx's net sales, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its last quarter's poor performance. The transport industry left its profit forecast for the whole year weakened due to the decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55 000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that 50 000 seasonal workers would be employed during holidays.
The company's share fell by around 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May, with a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite price increases of 4.9 per cent on average. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. The additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company is still expecting performance growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in e-commerce.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
A day after the announcement by the competitor UPS of its plans to employ about the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 persons, the plan for hiring seasonal workers was announced.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was USD 692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The earnings per share were $2.42, so the 12 analysts from Zacks Investment Research were left behind for $2.44.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the net sales were expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been tested in recent years by a reduction in international first-class broadcasts, which has caused the company's Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth in online commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed the increased costs of large-scale deliveries and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening up of the actual trading process, FedEx's share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock fell by 11% from the average for the year and by 17% below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve of the United States of America will be meeting at the most anticipated meeting in years, and a group will sit at the 8-metre-long Honduras wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the decorative two-storey conference room of the Central Bank is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must put the state's financial interests before everyone else's.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the Central Bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start a withdrawal from the unexpected stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that have remained close to zero in the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in the financial markets can cause the already cautious central bank officials to freak out more volatility by raising the reference rate for federal taxes - even a percentage point in a quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give sufficient cause to wait yet," says Piegza.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the Central Bank is planning, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in the Bloomberg study were sceptical about the rise in interest rates this week.
In financial markets, however, the central bank is expected to wait, and according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance of withdrawal.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, the stock prices may fall unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising a second one.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"This acceleration was driven by expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of financial market participants unshakable."
In turn, one of the experts said that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month; this would be the first small step in tightening up the financial conditions and thus strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Mr Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that he was expecting an increase in interest rates this year - despite the fact that, according to the Liberals, economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, reaching its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank is reducing to full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up.
While inflation continued to fall below the Central Bank's annual 2% targets, the central bank's decision-makers stated that the main reason for this was the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take account of the tight labour market situation," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were not startled last month when China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height in May and investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month and Dow Jones has already fallen by almost 10% from the peak in May.
The market turmoil means for central bank decision-makers that consideration of the increase in the steering rate will become even more complicated.
"The work of the Central Bank is becoming more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy over recent weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he believes that the Central Bank will wait at least one month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the situation since recent developments in the Chinese economy."
Rehabilitation of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern and should not, in principle, affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the Central Bank is the most influential player in the world's monetary system.
The Central Bank has had an enormous impact in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from the then President, Ben S. Bernanken, that the Central Bank could narrow the scale of its activities caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined; in addition to monitoring global developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who is entitled to vote in the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led the Central Bank to decide at three meetings to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though only a limited number of identifiable sanctions were available for economic growth in the United States," said Lacker.
A year later, the Central Bank overturned the decision.
"The central bank should put monetary stability first only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Committee.
The latest turmoil does not even come close to such a situation, "he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates because of the shock of the market," added Posen, the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability; until this changes, I do not think that we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazilian Rio Grande Children's Doctors' Association promotes a decent diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association of Children's Doctors in Rio Grande has developed a sugary way to teach nursing women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breast-fed and painted with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This gives the baby all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie levels by approximately 500 calories.
According to a new study, addition to increasing calorie levels should be accompanied by other changes in diet.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women can affect baby genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven Sunris has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead on the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson called on Canberra to conduct a morning programme on the aftermath of the election of the leader of the Liberal Party, but this did not improve the ratings of Today.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull left Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage, the morning program of the competing channel, was sent from London. Special broadcasts for a week are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the distance did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrisea had an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, while the Today programme represented 339 000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000), but remained from last Thursday's reading (343 000).
Today has reached a distance to Sunris over the past few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 admissions, and Sunris had 330 000 admissions.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 admissions and today 314 000 admissions.
This is the most interesting event of all morning.
The changes in the winds will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The remarkable novelty of Seven was the 800 Words novelty series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children. The new series reached a huge number of 1,219 000 admissions.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 spectators. The series brightly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Familes (726,000) series.
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured spectators in varying degrees.
The first half hour (17.00-17.30) of the new game series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe was followed by an average of 446 000 admissions.
In the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase in the first half of Australia had an average of 520,000 admissions, and the other half gathered an amazing 720,000 admissions.
Hot Seat's audience was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second-night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass by at 5: 30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who couldn't challenge the McGuire series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams, but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of the Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of the bachelor of dreams, Sam Wood, has been a carefully guarded secret.
The three remaining women won't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked for Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the triplets was dropped off.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were glowing that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity and thought he was an appropriate partner in his qualities.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit their own spot, their answers could give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
It's been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As soon as I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah's got feet on the ground, and she's really funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I'm putting all my money on our relationship," said Mackay.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose, if he did not choose him, she answered in a mysterious way:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like the other girls as much as you do, and Snezana and Lana are even."
The Bachelor of Dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7: 30.

Jarryd Hayella has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne when he moved to the United States. Several other clubs were also interested in him after last year's impressive open day of training.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like he hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man did on the Australian rugby team. Hayne screwed up the flight kick return after the team took the victory on Tuesday from Minnesota, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave him a second chance to return the kick, and the coach kept Hayne at the game after Reggie Bush got hurt.
Tomsula also continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He didn't rush the newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers' special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about a failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's screwing up the capture of Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been expecting something else from the man's NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after a failure, hundreds of times, and later told Hamish and Andy on channel 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start in his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his pitch in his own region opened a seat for Queensland.
But all in all, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published an Instagram photo of him posing together with the fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are discussing gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at an airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was condemned, the man-owned oil company Jukos was foreclosed and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead after the police shot rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal.
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of government told us on Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of rubber bullets at a protest against the alleged new constitution in the country, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, less than 300 kilometres from the capital of Katmandu.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me the police used tear gas and fired into the air before the rubber bullets were fired.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which may kill but are generally considered to be less destructive, were suddenly so lethal.
This was the most recent clash of weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent strife since 10 August,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive subject in Nepal, where administration has been centralised for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislative instruments accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the tragic earthquake in April.
The co-legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and according to the authorities the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure area about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde islands could be 60% likely to develop a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, announced the National Hurricane Center in the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miamese Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear centre of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google intends to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations helping thousands of people who have fled war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of management, the campaign was launched by a Google employee, Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled by train and bus in the dark and we were starving, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the crisis of refugees and immigrants in Europe, many families in similar situations are in desperate need of assistance.
Donations are made to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without frontiers, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children's Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
When donations have been collected from the address google.com / refugeereelief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, making the total amount reach 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since the Second World War, which is particularly exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mild overweight type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from a obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after a bold surgery than those receiving non-surgeries.
"Getting mortality data takes time," said Dr. Blubstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who was working on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical procedures reduce hunger and limit food absorption in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes; however, the majority of studies have been conducted in morbidly overweight patients with a BMI of 35 or more.
Body mass index indicates a weight-to-height ratio of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the body mass index is above 25, the person is overweight and the body mass index above 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng hospital in Taiwan used the data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to medicines for type 2 diabetes in slightly obese subjects.
After the obesity surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The body mass index of patients receiving non-surgery remained close to 29.
In patients undergoing surgery, diabetes improved completely by 36% and partially by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and in part only about 2%.
The study also showed better blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL-cholesterol in the surgical group.
Researchers also monitored patients' levels of haemoglobin-A1c, which describes the development of blood glucose levels.
Researchers report a Hb-A1c recommendation of less than 7%.
After surgery, the haemoglobin level decreased from 9% to 6% on average.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
Haemoglobin-A1c is a measure of blood glucose control. However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgical procedures.
In the fifth year of the gastric bypass surgery group, the weight loss was higher than in the cervical surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), and the haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1% respectively). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes also improved completely in a larger proportion (46.9% and 16.7%).
The new study was not able to show lower mortality after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone, a member of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery brings life-years to obese people.
In the Swedish study, the probability of death in the 15-year period was reduced by 29% for obese persons undergoing gastric bypass surgery compared with the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone nevertheless confirmed that persons with a body mass index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that expose obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accept all refugees, as the Dalai Lama has said, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama Lama Centre in Oxford focused on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a great thing, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to consider and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," stressed the Dalai Lama.
"After all, we need to consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
With force, problems have never been solved, "he added.
The Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and claimed that, in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States produced an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come from non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to forces that had unpredictable consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Tissue swallowing cases quadrupled in children in 4 years
According to the Georgian Poison Centre, poison centres across the United States report a nearly quadrupled incidence of high-alcohol consumption in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, Georgian Poison Centre leader, the reported cases of hand swallowing in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children and, unfortunately, some of the children are sent to emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand desks on purpose, part to impress their friends and part to be inspired by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectant for cheap hops.
Teenagers are told to mix alcohol-rich mouthwash with disinfectant in order to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted by the smell of hand-palms.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large proportion of attractive handmade products are just fragrance.
There are hand-made products of strawberry, grape and orange taste that appeal to children. '
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45% and 95%.
A small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the hands is very high," Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a shot of whiskey in the hands of children, but if you leave a lot of disinfecting products in the hands of children, you can quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four lore-scented hands at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult drinking range," says the doctor who treated her, Chris Ritchey, at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
He couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
The doctors followed her room overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol, "Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes in addition to moving your hands beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontarian women died from ingestion of hand-held tissues containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities thought that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as an active substance in the product fiche.
According to the police report, three fourth-graders in the north of the state of New York were planning in January to kill an "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products throughout the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hand-holds and has forbidden it to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that went wrong was irrelevant and called for disciplinary action on the part of the training officer.
Rumour mill: no discord in Celtic lines
Griffith belittles the discord of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that everything is not all right with the team, but believes she can make things right.
Hearts buttons against the SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton beware of January transfers so that team unity does not suffer.
Aberdeen's neck on Celtic, five points.
The first half of ADAM Rooney's sentence brought to Aberdeen a meagre victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium.
Griffiths belittles the talk of discord.
Griffiths has ignored the rumours of discord in Celtic's ranks. According to his own statements, Griffiths and his team are not under observation when preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch need an old Scottish battle partner - de Boer
The former Rangers' midfield player and the Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers' duel.
De Boer, who was in charge of Ajax's team, said: "In Holland, there are no more highlights to Celtic games.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved. "
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need a team-to-team duel.
Old Firm games are extremely exciting, and they are also of interest outside Scotland's borders. "
I'm turning it around, Deila assures me.
Ronny Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that there will be a change in the situation.
The club lost to Malmö fell from the League of Champions and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic's had some tough episodes before, and we're getting up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sadness in many people.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, which will strengthen players considerably.
"A common spirit is very important now."
Warburton careful in January's player moves
Although only a few weeks ago the Rangers' boss, Mark Warburton, hinted at the January players' moves, he was cautious about the transporter slump and says that he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"January players' transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," said Brentford's ex-coach.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful this season in our lineup.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause the team more harm than benefits. "
Michu, looking for retirement in Celtic's sights
Swansea's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic in a player transfer speech. Michu, on the other hand, has hinted about retiring after the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, 29-year-old, has had an angry ankle for years, and he was unable to get transferred from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA fight for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was revoked later. This is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be repealed.
But Neilson remains behind his words, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears he'll avoid Tynecastle.
Griffiths was reprimanded when he admitted that he lured slanting lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh prior to the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming up, and the mood was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee you I won't go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic ranks."
Tannadice Management Team believes in Dundee United's coaching management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures me that the Dundee United board of directors can make the situation better, and surrender on the ground can no longer be allowed.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for battle, "Donnelly said.
McInnes satisfied with the Hamilton victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to stand up to Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league victory, winning over Aberdeen with a five-point neck on Celtic at the top of the serial board, thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Islands
The number of unemployed persons remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed, while in the United Kingdom as a whole the number of unemployed persons increased by 10 000.
According to the UK Statistical Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
The number of persons employed in Scotland is 12,000 fewer than three months earlier, now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the average employment rate in the United Kingdom as a whole falling to 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs, David Mundell, commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will be sitting in the execution room of the state of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I responded positively to the invitation.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought this would be the best way to tell the true story of the death penalty.
The view would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States, and as there are more applications than seats, the participants will be selected with a macabre value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I have created a personal relationship with a man, because we have spoken on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can't be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a convicted story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him. "
I gave the reporter my dissenting opinion.
The journalist woman admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but still considered my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote the fight against the death penalty.
The reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I am not going to repeat the details here.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed the murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
You can read an objective description of other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police raid.
The officer in the Canning Vale area stayed dry to lure a man out of the Canning River.
The Pertanist's escape attempt fell into a shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few feet away got the man down to dry land.
Canning Vale PD got a call Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to shake the police off by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"A man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to bring him in," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not tempted to water his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic - a negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt can make a person resort to amusing ways," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown by the police and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees tried to spy on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames Racing Victoria's agents for trying to spy on their stables last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity department have attacked him personally, and the rejection of Lady Tate due to the recent treatment given on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to work for racing sport. Moody has been put in a difficult position when the Lidar sample found cobalt, and the man couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody's been keeping her tongue down for a year and a half on espionage charges, and he didn't want them to seem like a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks out at once," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the state after I opened my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well at night.
I want the horse owners to think I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe in it, I don't think it's a good idea for me to continue as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach. "
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told us about the anti-corruption espionage companies in his garage.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on me. I'll tell him his name on request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should present the evidence, because I have not been caught for anything unauthorized.
The former president of RVL, Robert Roulston, the current president of RVL, David Moodie, and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal manhunt?
Should the RVL take serious action and take responsibility for the situation in the sector other than for coaches?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'll get a coaching license and push me out of my duties, but there's no doubt I can get a lot of people to think that way when I talk to them.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that's sad.
It's really sad.
I'll put pressure on them to make their decision.
My family will support me, and I can withdraw. "
The long-standing investigation of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection situation ultimately frustrated the coach so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the day-care rule as ridiculous after the horse's legs had been placed in an irregular clay wrap.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that, "said Moody.
"A member of my staff misplaced clay on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday in the day, and that's what happened.
But it was the day of the race. "
Moody can expect a three-month ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far, "Moody said.
The men who escaped from Cobram's crash scene were arrested.
The police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist this weekend and fled the scene of the accident.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured when the car crashed into him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove the car escaped from the scene and didn't stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton Police Department.
The man is likely to be charged with failing to comply with the standstill and assistance obligations in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy points to adversaries' wrestling talk.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's tactical game to be a goal of the two league favorites of the NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach, Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm wrestling to Melbourne's hosts in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
The director of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying finals on Saturday night in Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that Queensland didn't pay much attention to wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they were just focused on contact when they tackled him.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the criticism of his team by two top team coaches. Bellamy sees this as an indication that the coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defence system or technology all year long, and for the past six weeks we have only invested in contact games and tackle, which has turned us up.
Trent's been on this mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he has a great team that isn't used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what was interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his team's Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting, "Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George received a great deal of criticism for his boring game. Wayne said that he was not in a moment of criticism.
Now he has a team that can play the so-called football, especially his young, fast forward attackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play with a player arsenal like this.
He highlighted this in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play in his style, and not all teams have a team like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when the other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they're going to resort to this kind of thing.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in the Storm-Roosters game than in the Broncos / Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the quarterbacks and underscoring interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them. "
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit either the Cronulla Sharks of North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available for sale on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man on bail for $200,000 in a drug case.
A man awaiting a life sentence for attempted possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the police found a 100-kilo shipment of cocaine on the Solay ship, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at Coomera port in August.
The police watched the meeting between Maximovic and the accomplice at the marina this morning and later surprised the two of them at the Coomera Roadhouse café. A 40-kilo drug shipment was found in the car in the parking lot of Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovic may be facing life imprisonment for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, his lawyer says that there is no evidence that his client tried to take over the entire batch, but that he may have been in the café for an innocent purpose.
According to the Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic has clear links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his apartment."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather jointly bailed out 200 grand for which the man was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to stop a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he handed over both his Australian and Serbian passports to the police every day and remains at home from 6: 00 a.m. to 6: 00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send photos.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get hold of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged into an online messaging service where he got another user to send out inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and she found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she went through the contents of her phone, she found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police. After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search words to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a cop to scare paedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said in the local justice system at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on intimidation.
He admitted to doing the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so to play the police and thus intimidate paedophiles.
Hogg was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that he intended to mislead pedophiles.
He told me he had some disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When she found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw some inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed to the charges of possession of inappropriate child photos on June 14 last year. Hogg violated his release from bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court for hearing on March 24 this year.
Advocate Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it could be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October for background social work reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in remand on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sex offenders even before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened was rapidly spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by the allegations by the opposition party legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them about booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, Members of Parliament booed and interrupted the speech by the President on the state of the state in Parliament with a speech by the President on Tuesday.
Mr Innocent Gonese, the bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said that seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is" death, "" Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech. "
The message warns recipients that outside Parliament, representatives are no longer subject to immunity.
According to the party's whip, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of the business services business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will separate the computer and printer business from faster growth in business equipment and services.
According to HP's announcement, the company will record a one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter of the year.
"The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," explained Meg Whitman, Managing Director of HP, who will run the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a large and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of more than USD 50 billion and, according to its mission, focuses on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company set up by Stanford University educators Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s is now divided in two. The two started an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
The HP has undergone massive restructuring as traditional desktop computers are entering mobile devices.
Changes in HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in a sector where it is believed that concentration is a success.
Captain Mikel Artta of Arsenal: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before facing Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes according to the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport as early as December.
The best scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four UK national team games. Knowing the history of a man, his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the last problem is that Wilshere ended last season with a strong ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new period.
"Such an injury does not threaten his career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries. "
From a medical point of view, this may be the case, but as Wenger also pointed out, additional injuries may occur when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in the ranks of Arsenal in 65 out of 157 league matches during the last five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that since the 2007-2008 season, six out of eight seasons the team has been the second of the teams that lost the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to develop for the better.
"Sometimes a post-injury return can involve a vulnerable period when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he's gonna be okay.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves. "
Arsenal will start his career in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger is preparing for minor changes in the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Artta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give those in need some rest," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-Group's successor, Maximir Zagreb has one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been invincible in 41 games during the team.
The stadium was shaking on Tuesday night when the country was shaking at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson since he had to bend to Monaco. He is also still motivated by the distant desire to pilot the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realist with experience.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers. "
FriendsFest: Comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that suicide statistics for young men are at their highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death of men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM) takes up the problem by declaring 2015 the year of men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2,000 students in high school. According to the study, those with symptoms of depression have a better chance of healing if they have enough healthy people around them.
The probability of illness in asymptomatic persons was also halved if there were people close to them who had no mental health problems.
But it's all based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success are all distracting from our inner values and natural longing for personal growth and friendship. Inner values affect our mental health more deeply.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently said that money cannot actually buy happiness.
Well, the beauty of the Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined not by profession, but by personality, and this was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football in his TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that men could relate to this even though they did not refrain from feeling fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and thinking about suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should survive is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems. "
"Friends are one of those sets of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of male friendship were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from the outside at a time of despair, but long-term support comes from friends and family. "
In honor of the Friends Fest at the Comedy Centre, the set sets have been brought back to life. So if you're going to attend the event this weekend, you should take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central sends the entire Friends series - all 236 episodes - # Friends Fest
Di Maria's hit helped the PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matud and Edinburgh Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started his job in the Champions League by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She strengthened the position of French champions as soon as she shook hands. PSG, however, screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
In Section A are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not just looking for an extension in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarter-finals in the three remaining matches.
Even though SPG caught the score, the match was not the perfect show for the team led by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal spot and the man was traded against his former home-company career, where the man began his staggering career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in strangers, so the 2-0 win and the good grip provide a good basis, even though we still have something to do for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for profit and we could do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two more goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned to the team's ranks after being injured. The team had to settle for a 2-2 tie in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. Di Maria, however, left Ibrahimovic in the shade at four minutes.
Last month, an Argentinean dock from Manchester United to the PSG ranks was named the PSG's solution to raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be worthy of the nomination when he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt's pass past Malmö's defense and then fired an exact shot at the back corner of the goal by Johan Wilandi.
However, those who waited for the PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players from the start. The team playing the five-man defense and two-attacker tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was barely past Kevin Trapp's goal on the back pole in the 34 minutes of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the paint to the base of Cavani.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his claws in the pass game. From the ibrahimovic pitch Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was created at the time of the count thanks to Cavan. The Uruguayan, who plays through his six, shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmo's kiri ended in another goal, and only the peak battle against Wiland at close range by David Luiz was kept in check, and the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who came out of the bench, was rejected in the final meters.
Malmo's pilot Åge Hareide subsequently admitted that PSG was of his own class. "We played the last Champions League game last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hammerhead for the Parisians.
This was a great show for them. "

Brown was stunned and injured by the argument. "Wow, that's it," she said, "On Mars alone, after Damon's comment."
Damon and Brown had gathered with the other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character will be played," said Brown at first.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."

When the conversation was on TV, the social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
