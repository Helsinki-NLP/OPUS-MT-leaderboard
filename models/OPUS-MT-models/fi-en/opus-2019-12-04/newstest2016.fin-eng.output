A 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere was found
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The missing persons report concerning the boy who left Western Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life or health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Som at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found in the neighborhood around the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, rampant, tore the end line to the Mess.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued to work in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal king of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo took the lead in all-time goal-maker statistics when he fired two hits on the network of the visitor Shahtar Donetsk for penalty kicks and one for the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his March to 80, when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messi, who was on the level with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the 4-0 game.
Juventus has stumbled from the beginning in the Italian football league in Serie A, but in the Champions League's D-section it started with a 2-1 guest victory in Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus Alvaro Morata ten minutes before the end.
City's attack was bored by the absence of the kneecapped Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, was also hard hit by the PSV Endhoven in Holland after a 1-2 loss.
It took Luke Shaw, 20-year-old wing defenseman of ManU, 15 minutes to catch up.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the target against the attack cell ManU-pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the grass of the Eindhoven home stadium ten minutes before medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno was even before the break in time.
The winner of the PSV was Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The goal of the season in the Champions League was launched by the A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria from Argentina who replaced Manchester United's shirt with a PSG doll.
Di Maria broke through right and pulled the ball past Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinburgh Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been put on the list of successful season players.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best reference.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star invader of the PSG, met for the first time his professional career with Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost in a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party called for an immediate resignation - the president made the wrong speech.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech in the parliament he gave at the end of last month.
I guess during his 25-minute speech, Mugabe didn't realize it was the same speech.
The speech aroused doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit power.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants hastened to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was about China's influence on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The request was evaluated by Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to get Europe registered more effectively.
According to Mr Merkel, the negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the home ministers' table.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during the 911 call.
The voice of a slightly colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the 911 call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" was alive and probably upset, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's next of kin were found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on the side of the book: "I'm so sorry I could cancel this lover Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said the experts who signed Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already travelled nearly 500 kilometres to the campus where the police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University told me that the university staff heard about the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made a fatal 911 call for some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the plunger.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lambi's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have made public information showing that students and staff described Lambi as a talented teacher with potential problems.
The students told me they were waiting for his feelings.
The police in the place where Prentiss died, Gautier, say that Lamb had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students took courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and anxious, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lambi told him that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave at Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
The recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard on his doctorate, it did not restore his automatic career development and the position of assistant professor.
The university principal, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Mr Lamb and Mr Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something in his mind."
These are the questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
After Lamb escaped from campus, the police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville in Mississippi, reported by the Washington County coroner, Metel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated from PhD in Education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when she met her friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston how to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax when he was there, now told the 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburbs of Jackson in Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told me they were divorced 15 years ago, but he stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played a bunch of gigs together.
O'Steen tells me his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several network companies.
The bartender at The Julep Room near Gautier and the occasional entertainment rapporteur, Mike Shaffer, says that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing games and throwing squabbles at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year of student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, told the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, at Delta State campus, there was a candlelight exercise involving some 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the mass during which the university choir sang songs on Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Greenville in Mississippi and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police say that Lamb has now made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although I referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the distributor of toy and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, compared to 45 000 people paid during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was an extremely important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said the coming documentary at the Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and it comes to me that I'm just a fake yawn and a stretch of my hand away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary on Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
A return to the future had its premiere 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "For me, it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available on subscription video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be solved with arms" and that additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations in order to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban told us that he intends to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of powers between the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they had shown in the agreement on Iran's nuclear programme in the context of the Syrian crisis.
8 support surveys showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some people have tried to label him as a wind viper.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of us are waiting for the crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
From the last 11 national queries, Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit chapter, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of the appointment of a real estate king.
Of course, the election season is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leading position to the emerging Herman Cain, neither of which received any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Association Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's perseverance and have begun to use their funds to bring him down.
The following recent support surveys suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popular numbers have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the polls at Monmouth University showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July this figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people say they're negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election Länder.
Last week in Iowa, 60% of the Republicans in the University of Quinnipiac reported that they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN / ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson gets about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "enthusiastic" versus 40% Trump).
What's next, the most exciting?
Marco Rubio's only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "dissatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the rulers, were to become a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News / Washington Post, 52% of the voters who are leaning to the Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's survey last week, the figure in Iowa, the first party meeting, is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for a leader.
According to the ABC / Post survey, however, 44% think that his character is not suitable for acting as President, and nearly six out of ten think that his character does not belong in the White House.
The Republican voters are getting used to it.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to the CNN / ORC survey, four out of ten thought Trump was the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be appointed as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: The Republican Party voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans took the view that Rick Perry would be nominated and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider the Trump campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans stood up for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's management, as the support against Trump is divided among a number of other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate Trump can win?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win a businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just now, the majority of the supporters of Donald Trump have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS / NOW survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters in favour of Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for certain that they would never change their minds.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's magnificence will drive the Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC / Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The frustration of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC / Post survey that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register / Bloomberg's survey on Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unhappy" and 21% "really angry."
Jeremy Corby's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
The first appearance of Corbyn during Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corby, the new Labour leader, is facing David Cameron for the first time during Prime Minister Question Time.
Corby is going to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour Members are watching his performance closely.
Corby has demanded "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain - the air war, has aroused criticism among the Conservative Party MPs and has appeared in a number of front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said that he "stood respectfully silent" and that he recognised "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
A member of the Corbyn shadow government, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have called on the leader of the Labour Party to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he felt that the Royal House should be closed.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in the Corbyn inner circle, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and initially less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policy regarding the position of the party in the European Union as well as the government's aid ceiling have been "accumulated" even within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At a meeting of the Trade Union Confederation, Mr Corbyn said that the Labour Party was proposing a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's secretary for work and pensions, Smith, said that the party was "quite clear" in that they only oppose the government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corby will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "amassed" ideas into questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corby, the representative of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both witty words and snitches, but instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and young people's challenges.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government secretary, takes her place during Question Time when Corby does not participate - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other Members should also be allowed to speak at some time, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, Mr Bercott, on this matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the Director's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other Members of Parliament, even though critics have criticised Question Time for being a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Described in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained to be photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first kids to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound will rise as the British wage growth is accelerating
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed an increase in the British wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the tender target SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by estimates of higher rates.
The pound rose by over 1% against $1.5505 and by 0.84% against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49 per cent increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and increased by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9% after encouraging news from the competing luxury product group Richmont.
The latest sales figures for Richemont were better than expected and also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant reported that it had raised USD 2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The stock of the packaging and paper group Mondi was the largest calculator of the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to "sell '.
JD Sports increased by 3.1 per cent after the sporting clothing company published its six-month output before tax: an increase of 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
According to JD Sports's Director, higher wages can damage enlargement
The director of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in Britain, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, "says Cowgill.
The costs could be linked to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grass-roots campaign against the invasion of Aldi's industry.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open up two distribution centres and the first store early next year in Southern and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming in. At the same time, Metcash and the IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media and through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer a taste in IGA's shops, and store owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organises an annual strategy day for investors.
There is a great deal at stake, as Southern and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of the IGA area of Metcash, where profit margins are higher than those of the IGA network of the eastern Länder of Metcash.
Shopping in South and West Australia is known to be corner-facing and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern Countries.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will capture around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million a year for sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west, which will generate a turnover of 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Cole, although a recent study by Roy Morgan concluded that IGA's customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metash could "possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
It has been understood, however, that a member of the board of Metcash had contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and profits from the food and food business in Metcash, which supplies around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations in the context of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler stands up and has invested over $150 million a year in lowering the prices of hundreds of products every week to the same level as Coles and Woolworth, helping IGA dealers to refurbish shops by adding fast-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
The Director-General of Metcash, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving shops has increased attractiveness and hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of increased profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association, supports your Thanasi Kokkinkis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has rampaged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian Tennis Association.
The younger member of the talented two known as "Special See" was unwittingly exposed to the event where Kyrgios provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after that, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the main judge had to fire Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although last seen Kokkinakis breaking up his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a firm defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for a second place in a duel with Bernard Tomic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that your Thanasi has just been dragged into a ruckus," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, including in quite provocative situations at US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He's very mature for 19, he works hard, he's fit for the team and so on, and he's never had a problem with other players. He's appreciated in the locker room, he's practicing hard, he's in good condition and he's a very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but I still support the Canberra's return to the team's standard equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemic around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as the Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in the public eye, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of forcing the influx of migrants into the country.
There was chaos along the border as hundreds of immigrants gathered in an objective area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled from the violence of their own countries have now erected their tents and settled on an indefinite road between the inspection posts of two countries.
However, frustration increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants said "Open the border!" and cried out insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some people turned down food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared it 'unacceptable' to return migrants from Hungary when more and more people are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
Confusion on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities between 40 000 people seeking asylum who have now taken over Italy and Greece and expressed their hope for reaching a final agreement - by the end of next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit next Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
Hungary does not, however, hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work soon.
Tuesday's emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and made it possible to close you down and speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country is also going to erect a barbed wire on part of its border with Romania in order to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottlenecks and a point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are at war on the run from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees seeking a better life and not those fleeing under war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre barbed wire fence (13 feet) built by the government on the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, informed journalists in the city of Szeged in the south.
We are very clear on this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally accept the military deployment scheduled for next week, but the suppliers of the Associated Press at the border have been seeing for days heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and their dogs.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic security adviser, said that 45 people had been apprehended by the authorities when they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already gone further into the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these points.
The main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary was covered by chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for the handling of people and the crowds tried to barge in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refused food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues in a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democrats (down from 58%) and the second Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the democrats' electorate.
More than five months before the primary elections, the majority of democrats say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has increased somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the Democratic electorate of less than 50 has disappeared and he is now on the same footing with Sanders.
But Clinton clearly leads the way among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit chapter among the liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
Around half of the democrats in the country say that they will be very enthusiastic in supporting Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The opinions are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48% of the democrats say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, the same is said by fewer Republican voters (35%) for the Republican's number one man, Donald Trump.
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had appropriate experience (16%). The most popular responses were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an influence on the potential presidential candidacy, 57% of the Democratic electorate would like to see him in the race - although a third of them disagree.
When asked by the democrats who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership in Sanders will increase. If Biden goes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he does not, the figure will be 30.
55% of the democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this measure, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who think he is most voting has increased.
However, when the democrats were asked what was most important in the candidate, they put their opinions before voting.
Also last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do the trio best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democrats say they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they have no opinion on Sanders.
In general, the democrats also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these points, about a quarter of the democrats say they have no opinion on Mr Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is Foreign Minister still raises questions, the majority of the democrats are satisfied with his explanation and say that this did not affect their public opinion on him.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
In March, the people were divided shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say that e-mail polemic did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although he is considered honest and reliable by the voters of Clinton's own party, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters; only 32% think he is honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton does not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the voters registered in the whole country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many people do not have an opinion on him, just as they do not on Carson.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national inquiry.
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times survey
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes leaving the others to fight instead.
The Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% to 27% of the last CBS survey, which was published on Tuesday before the Fox News debate last month.
At the same time, however, Carson rose sharply from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with various demographic groups and is crowding out Trump's college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in this latest survey, carried out in September, is + / - 6 per cent in a sample of 376 Republican voters.
Last week's CNN / ORC survey showed that Carson was on the rise in the polls: he has a 19% support for the Republicans and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also according to the latest ABC News / Washington Post survey, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are accused of the death of Baruch College's first year student.
Almost two years after the death of the student in the frat's hazing ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the accession rite in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag of sand of over 13 kg, and then repeatedly tackled the ground when he tried to walk through an icy field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head was hurting, and then he passed out.
The members of the brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but the allegations were that they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, "says the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, to look online for information about his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, asking for advice, "Chris Wagner, Chief of Police, said at a press conference.
"At this point members began to hide their rituals and thus practically put the welfare of the brotherhood before Michael Deng," said Commissioner Wagner.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force trauma to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered from frat hazing, when at least one student has died every year since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the murder of a third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We do not only want individuals to be held accountable; if there is an organisation behind what has happened that has accepted the situation either officially or informally, then they must also be held accountable," said Wagner at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood disbanded their contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates
Interest rate increases will come, and the market for rising rates will collapse, bond yields will rise and the economy will be in recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes or how long it lasts.
The past does little to help with timing, particularly as regards the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first withdrawal, while it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressive behaviour of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial resources.
That is why the US Central Bank officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the development cycle of the period leading up to normalisation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about interest rate increases has been overstated.
"The first increase of the Central Bank following the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles for the end of the" cheap money "era," said Capital Economics' chief financial expert Julian Jessop in the message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, albeit still low, to be a revolutionary shock which many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it does not have any effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As seen in the market over the last month or so, waiting for interest rate increases can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect will not be quite so dramatic.
"It appears that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said the analysts of Deutsche Bank in a recent study on what will happen after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6%), and normal conditions have been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reported as Nuveen Asset Management's leading venture capital company, Bob Doll, in a recent analysis published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle when profits start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate increases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the Central Bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of gross domestic product, which will be the closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6 per cent, few people believe it will remain, as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, "says the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of "whether this time is different ', Deutsche Bank stated.
The market participants have prepared for the Central Bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept this increase at this meeting, the futures trade only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all cycles of increases have so far occurred in the supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peak very quickly after recovery has begun," says the report.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
At the moment, the central bank has been waiting by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is already 74 months in progress.
The fixed return has also been unstable in the expectation of interest rate increases on the market and the model is somewhat similar to the findings on capital.
The main difference is that, when the central bank changes its policy, its effects will be reflected more quickly in debt securities than in shares.
The yield in the bonds appears to change immediately for the first increase / cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields will drop immediately, "Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that raising interest rates will result in a convergence of returns on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus offsetting the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for a return," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's firm return analyst in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more stable, the credit margins have increased and the volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened up its policy.
In general, companies whose business activity is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, perform worse when the dollar rise makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that" high-quality "shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first increase in interest rates," noted Goldman Sachs analysts in their report to customers.
Enterprises with strong turnover overtook low turnover enterprises after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality enterprises, with a mean of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from a dollar rise.
Savers can also make profits with higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "popularization"
He claims that it becomes more and more difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted BBC Music Awards, saying that they only mimic Brit Awards
Mr Collins, Member of the European Parliament, criticised the Voice, saying that it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into the Classic FM, claiming the leading MP, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said to the leaders of the BBC that the public service radio channel seemed to "popularise" its content and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I would not like to use the term" folk talk "- is turning into a classic FM," he said.
He also aimed for the BBC Music Awards award, which was launched last December.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards only seem like a brand-new Brit Awards gala.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples that I remember directly when, in fact, you only copy something that is already on the market, "said Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC contested the charges claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival regarding live music and the sharing of information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches such things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is in fact first class.
"Furthermore, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to work more than previously to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The music competition bought by the BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million, was criticised by the Conservative Tory MEP, Damien Collins.
Do you understand why this programme is often debated because it is not original and is not in any way distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this program of the BBC1 channel, in which the star judges are Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced "quite BBC style."
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside its own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future "The Voice" periods or to impose that the money of the licensors should be used for other entertainment formats.
Net sales increased least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month the rise was lowest after the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may contain consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into haunted cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling down of online sales, while the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption grew least in August since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent grew from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of offsetting online sales, while the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index supplier, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that they could be made in different environments, such as the sofa.
But now it is levelling down, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slow-down trades.
Experts believe that consumers are holding back shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average, buyers swarm to their computers to grab shops, knocking down many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which led buyers to argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead of Mecca's crane accident, the Bin Laden family consequences
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of the construction giant Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in the Mecca mosque.
Mainly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed the sacred place where just a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family building group as guilty of a disaster in which 394 people were also injured.
Of the worshippers who were killed by a crane in the Mecca Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried across the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the grand mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arab version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the directors of the company were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the grand mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the rankings and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the Group of its failure to use up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Grand Mosque of Mecca, which are part of a huge building block run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, and it is leading major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities are telling us 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (£174 000) to be paid to the families of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B & Q boss says Eastern European low-cost workers are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using their assistants' services, "says Veronique Laury.
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result of the opening of the Screwfix shops for professionals 200 more
Meanwhile Kingfisher closes 60 B & Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Head Correspondent of the City to Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint shrubs and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to carry out home restoration work
It seems that if you're handy with a hammer or a hash to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
The British are hiring more and more assistants to do the job themselves in their homes, "says the head of the company behind B & Q.
The new President of Kingfisher, who owns the home improvement chain, Veronique Laury, said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a high price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix shops for workers and close 60 B & Q stores.
She said she wanted more women to work in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the most beautiful gender.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population had to be taken into account: today there are more households of one woman doing more home improvement work than in the past.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process. "
Laury is only one of the five women who run the most important companies in the FTSE100 index in Britain, and has rebuilt his management team with equal numbers of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of women in the group, including its President and Financial Director.
She said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women for the management team. "
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' profits and sales after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other workers' federations began to be forced right away, and as a result the country will stand on Friday due to the widespread protest of the workers.
There's a lot of people who think that makes sense.
Why don't we ask him if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad enough?
Even a resistance business has been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old good consensus time, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a scumbag would have been a small person's political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of trade unions are not protesting much, but it gives us something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in the work of the Ay movement, the brutal solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things seem to be rolling with their own weight, we are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union, as membership of the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organisations do, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Lappeenranta University has a hard savings cycle: target of 8.5 million savings, staff reduced by 130%
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings cycle aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start working negotiations on all personnel, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of some 130 employees.
An additional 2 million will be saved for other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which expects the actual activity to be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the government's budget cuts.
During this financial year, the university will achieve a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, while funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in business financing on our university is very significant, "says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding is reflected in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, the British owner Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail service.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, "says Souter.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local transport in the Greater Helsinki region in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter has already reported approaching the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veoli), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe, has expressed interest in rail transport.
The Federal Reserve has to make decisions on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
As Reuters conducted a survey on 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the Central Bank would raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that interest rates will be maintained at the current level of between 0% and 0.25%.
This is an historic event, because the central bank cut interest rates to zero is seven years old.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and start normalising interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Senior Fellow.
The US economy has been operating relatively well and the recovery has brought trillion dollars into the balance sheets and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Whoever shot Delta State University left an apology message.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting her colleagues later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and hoped "could cancel it" told the authorities on Tuesday.
The police at Gautier in Mississippi told me that the teacher at Delta State University, Lamb, called 911 at about 10: 00 in the morning.
On Monday, he told me that he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his house.
He said "he killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, which "doesn't bother anyone," but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written in hand by a 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, Lamb drove almost 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday while the police surrounded him.
The university principal, William LaForge, said that there was no conflict between Mr Lamb and Mr Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something in his mind."
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the allegations published on Monday that Mr Lamb had believed that Prentiss had had a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence of" any kind of "triangle."
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person."
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was "shocked."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "once and for all best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from his home online, and Sun Herald said that he was a close friend of Prentiss'.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached Lambi Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about educational science in Delta State in spring 2015, explains the CV available on the university's website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he had leukemia, and in 2009 his long-standing partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he's also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything like this really takes its toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture on his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven at the Champions League match.
Although the defenseman was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle at 15 minutes after a 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
She was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to give her oxygen before she went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he'll have surgery in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got the red card and the penalty shot.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican player.
Mr Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee should have made a mistake.
You can judge the situation when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged tackle.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defenseman will have an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone will be very sad.
Our players are never meant to hurt an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played against Van Gaal Holland on the Mexican team at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt your opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it that way.
The only thing I saw was a ball heading in a different direction, so it looked like he was touching it, but I didn't see Luke tackle it.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry. "
The PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long before you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss' "The Lorax," an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on SuperCamps' website and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have not seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill in the rather short original text.
"In the city of Avallen within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win the heart of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story that was not written by Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, the real name of Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plot of Lorax on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In the city inside the walls of Avallen, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted Boy hopes to win the heart of his dreams for Audrey."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, the young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-cutting and needs-knitting Kerskanen, regardless of the short, moustache creature who named him Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said that the text may have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the English team, but it was still tough.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last 3-0 series loss will happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a guest victory.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it has good thrusters and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in its spiral feed, and Adil Rashid is an attacker, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the English cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the selection of Joe Root before the release, because, as I have said before, players are the best players in the selection process.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was elected seven times on the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and there's a batter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, there's something we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moene has been bolted in a batting shot next to Cook to get an extra pitcher on the field but to keep four fast, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a batter can't hit there, and this left-handed has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he's a three for them and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first time he fell out before he moved on to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points straight away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team as a backup pitcher, and as much as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unscented statistics... hitting an average of 31 with a ball of 35... and think it's a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers available, and the electors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
Appointing Mahela Jayawardene, the Srilankan batter, as a consultant in the games may prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he's done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will be involved in the games of the white ball and will bring both energy and a relentless splash.
I've always thought that he was born to be part of an international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same useful intelligence as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is laid down in one day, Root was given a similar break from Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, coaches and electors don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Britain's exit from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-walled renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly difficult every day, even if we do not take into account the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" the choice of Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or the anger of the Trade Union Confederation for Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that, given that the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centered British agenda, full of disagreements and disruptive treaty changes, which they do not want most of the time.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Trade Union Confederation decided that it would not want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local observer, and then coming home saying that they will win supporters of reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward inside the British EU tent - 'Do not leave us alone with France', says Berlin - proposes that the shortest-looking ministers and officials in certain capitals should now be at a point where they do not care if we leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it is ruined in the same way as it did for the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Holland is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves on behalf of the Selfiebrits, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers can even plan to deliberately make useless comments in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 British referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a case" and "The renegotiation was of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU-sceptical the exclusive press is, what they were not at the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our 1973 membership was confirmed by a ratio of 2: 1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU direct bananas" when he was a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a wide range of tax-abiding goblins, phone hacking foreigners and people who have their registered office elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought exactly the same thing about them, but he realized that if you were in a cage with a horny gorilla, you'd have to give up bananas for a distraction if you didn't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair herself as regards the fight against Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had accepted the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who was kind enough to pat me in the back at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-taking Neil Kinnock's' 80s boycott of Murdoch's strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but undoubtedly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, developing.
He says that he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people in the UK Independence Party are certainly able to stand by this opinion outside the war goal of Ukip and the most ferocious nationalists in the Conservative Party.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn Fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when his inner scout would have liked to admit that the choice of Corby to appoint rugged John McDonnell as Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour Government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary was more attractive.
But the fight to keep up with 'any situation' - the statement by Mr Benn - was not what Mr McDonnell said, and not, by all accounts, what Mr Corby told the leaders and representatives at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever kind of non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the basic tour of McDonnell and Corbyn in relation to EU membership (and in line with their Benn regulated economy and their anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a key dogma in the dogma of the dogma of the dogmas.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), the foreign diplomats will just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have sceptical voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British 'poor military performance' in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticised Public Health England's e-tobacco assessment
Scientists have said that the state-funded agency's claim that electric tobacco is 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco was the result of a 12-person meeting with some of them linked to the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
PHE published this "milestone" report last month describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial which attacked the PHE's main conclusion of the "exceptionally shaky bottom."
Two other scientists who wrote in BMJ have wondered whether the allegations were "built on rock or sand."
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor of Public Health in Europe, Martin McKee, and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology in the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell say: "The guiding principle of public health is that policies should be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects the PHE's argument "according to the current best estimate, electric tobacco is about 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco" to be based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesise their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
Mr McKee and Mr Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, a company whose CEO is reported to have received funding previously from Brisish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding that they say he received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in the past, they are increasing.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not reported, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also report that the study has received funding from the sector.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of the PHE.
The study produced by the group "greatly admits" that there is a lack of "indisputable evidence of harm in most products and most of the criteria," writes McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
Mr McKee and Mr Capewell say that the PHE claims that "there is currently no evidence that electric tobacco acts as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers' is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of PHE's health and well-being, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "E-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty over the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although electronic cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, "says former Channel 4 Director.
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for the slowest kind of soap set up on Albert Square street, for example.
Mr Johnson said that licence fees should only be used for programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcasting times against the most widely viewed programmes of competitors and on channels such as BBC.
After Tony Hall, the CEO of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time, in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that the BBC produces and sends programmes that are clearly suitable for non-subsidised competitors," Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it is a good idea for this message or, in the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important transmission time because we want to raise as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the programme is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Mr Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders second, admittedly the house within implemented.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I do not think that would weaken the BBC at all. "
A serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010 said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for audience numbers "because of the goals of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, similar to the comments of former Sky leader Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders.
Mr Johnson said that the smaller public service programmes of the BBC "go to the BBC, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC therefore fulfils its remit and can then, in defending the proceeds of the 4 billion pounds of licence fees, hypocritically state that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programmes that no one is looking at'.
They put them on a delivery site where no one ever comes to see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I do not know if that is true for those people who have £150 as big money because they do not spend much on the BBC.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith task of "providing information, training and entertainment."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should be inspired by the Australian and Canadian broadcasting and should change the role to "inform, educate and entertain."
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Mr Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which, he said, are only shown on television by some, and to ally with commercial companies so that they can all be seen online.
"Sound genetics" enables brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to be controlled by sound wave discharges.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ears.
The impulses function by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic-responsive membrane channels.
Related: Researchers read and write about brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms show the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalassan, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jola in California, told The Guardian that this method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people's brains are electrocuted to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttle worms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalassan discovered that when they were surrounded by liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He discovered that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves that then travel through the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, as described in the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic nematodes, Chalassan genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasonic sound on modified worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms in which they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, my Chalasani says that the use of sonogentics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along an optical fiber to the desired site within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue without obstacles, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may be possible to temporarily induce target human nerve cells to respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," said Chalassan.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertising brings the British arms trade to shame.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-gun video.
Horrible killer planes!
Ankle-crushing leg braces!
Grape bombs!
And electric stun pumps that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The happy voice and the graphic language of comic books leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government's willingness to sell arms to repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in London.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and metro trains, which require a closer look.
"Important information, do you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together is asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a tank image.
In this September, a pack of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was displayed at the Museum of Cruel Designs (Museum of Cruel Plans) in Banksy Dismalan.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters across London using the "ad Space Hack Packages" packages. It is a six-pound package of hexagon keys that, according to the collective, "has access to a third of the entire planet's bus stop advertising space."
Transport for London has not been amused by this unauthorized "poster vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the "Cruel Designs" curator and the University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance front when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by a graphic designer and backstory editor who worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director Matt Lever discovered that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot in the ExCeL calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for shady corporation, but "it was more stopping to stress it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art associated with the station fair comes from inside ExCEL when exhibitors shop fantastic embellishments.
In his press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the US Army for "the AT4CS RS to be launched from the shoulder."
This includes "a unique tube-to-line point that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm at the age of 19 without knowing it. I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from being nervous to being completely scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, have you had a year off and what you think of Corby, and why "seriously I don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a yeast extract from HAHAHA to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe, ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, and not the people you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they will hand out fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights and overhang places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many homes form a culture of migration from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
From knocking on the door, knock on the door.
A guy in my dorm thought if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting a university in the top years of baking school, knocking on people's doors with a brownie plate and introducing yourself seems a little less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood," I baked you something, now smile when I ask you some personal questions "-50-reading.
Offering you homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will connect your face to a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Bad blended flour sugar fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student quarters.
I understand taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even though they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to be more grown-up about it than my roommate who mixed her milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make such a fuss that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverb pot playing the kettle.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play her drum and bass music quieter because it was 3: 00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally stopped at 5: 00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before putting her own music on, locked her door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse just moved into the same dorm with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your roommate as your future spouse, you'd hook up, break up, and then you'd see her every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to her?
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate really isn't your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense into your underside.
In the exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it can be cancelled in a moment.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the ceiling with a blue sticker as much as twice at the most.
A racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee - a house designed to be a reception center was tampered with in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on a foreign student accommodation in Kitee in North Karelia took place in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police told us earlier, this is not about accommodation facilities for minors asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for longer, "says Heidi Luukkinen, teacher of the Evangelical Academy of Kitten.
The windows and walls of the public college accommodation were tampered with racist signs such as swastika, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation rooms, "says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of youth guarantee education at the National School, there were approximately ten people in the building that was the target of vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," says Luke.
There are people from 12 different nationalities staying at the folk college.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minors for asylum.
Everyone in the messy building has a "a" status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are studying in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish, "says Luukkaainen.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit which can be issued for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, a briefing was held on Monday for students, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened, "says Luke.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out.
They were suspected of being responsible for at least three men and had been on the road in a light passenger car.
I believe that this is the whim of the weekend evening of the youth, since this subject has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, "says Luke.
In Salo, too, a hospital has been tampered with, and a reception centre has been planned for it.
The case happened last week.
On Tuesday evening, MTV reported on this issue on its website.
The hospital wall had a swastika drawn and written in English "You are not well come."
There's been a police report.
Focus 15.9. 16.02. Corrected by the police for incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The government will shut down the Y-train to Karelia - passengers in their bosom, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raasepor stops running in March.
The news indignated passengers arriving at the beginning of the evening shift of the train at the main railway station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downswing strikes the Siuntians, "said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is growing and people at work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can only depend on political will or lack of political will.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video that she will come to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes in the rest of Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be merged into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula will be disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase train services during the following contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be abolished throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be adopted by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström, a Siuntian, considers the state's train cutter to be short-sighted.
We are making the same mistakes that have been made in the past and are repeating them in a very systematic way.
Then you get remorse.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporans and Siuntians because it is fast and overtakes several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was troubled by the fate of those travelling beyond the city area by train.
"It is very sad for those who have to replan their journey," he said when he was in pain with the Y train.
There's going to be a little relief.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach, replacing the Y train in the Helsinki Region traffic area (HSL), which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for local authorities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the various options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million euros per year for the Y train, of course much more than this.
The R-line on the main line is missing two stations.
By contrast, the number of train shifts will double in Ainola and Saunakallio.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed down from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is reduced to the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
On the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu will decrease train shifts.
More than half a million journeys per year are made on halted mountains, while the total number of journeys in the traffic purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million per year to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the capital's timeliness book: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work "Capital" published in 1867-1894, writes in a book published today entitled "The state of play of the capital of Marx."
"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, the internationalisation and penetration of all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and fictitious capital have proved to be amazingly far-sighted.
The book's author list, based on the capital seminars organised by Hakase, also includes Professor of Aalto University, a respected financial expert, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
But the former Managing Director of the Institute of Economics and the Business Delegation is not Marxist, is it?
Oh, no.
Korkman on the phone tells me that he doesn't think Marx is a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The usual idea is that the history of the world is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too many conclusions from the beginnings of capitalism, "Korkman says.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are talking again about the interests of Marx, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand a big picture, a changing world as a result of a technical revolution," Korkman analyses.
But what the government is supposed to decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
In his mind, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
And yet, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskians and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated each other even more."
Today the debate is more diverse and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political burden of the past years.
"Every social scientist should familiarise himself with Marx's mind as with other classics," says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, "says AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
In the Sri Lankan civil war, it is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, the military's major attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as called for in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report charges torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English yo test allowed us to push social media.
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in the high school texts of autumn, which most had English.
More than 16,000 candidates were tested for their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a paper on social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to ask ourselves whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the text of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the website manager.
The headline was "Dear Agony Aunt."
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian resting chair.
He needed advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
A total of four subjects had to be selected.
"It was the hardest one," assessed the third topic in Porvoo, the English lecturer in Swedish high school, Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth one, Lybeck said it was all right.
It had to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test allowed you to answer questions about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
Autumn's writings will continue on Friday, when the test will take place for another resident, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In high school schools, the experiment is organised normally, i.e. it is not affected by the employees' demonstration.
The matriculation examination panel will ask candidates to find suitable access in time so that they can make it to the trial.
Additional time may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
A store was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint.
On Wednesday morning in Oulu, a store was robbed in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and had a small amount of money to catch.
This is being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the decision to cut the government will be blocked by the police on Friday in Helsinki.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STT unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alarm functions and other police activities, but also to ensure the flow of a massive protest.
The roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles during the period from approximately 9.30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the traffic circle of Kaisaniemi, the direction of the west starting from Mannerheim Road.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now, it looks like enough.
I'm not gonna take a stand on a cop's industrial combat business.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us the exact numbers of patrols.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," says Kujala.
The police suggest that you avoid private car driving in the city centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning to early evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Iron Road Market.
The buses are basically out of range.
The rest of the way must then be taken to the demonstration site, "says Kujala.
It also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a cop's point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these big public gatherings, is now partly self-evident.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the protest to go smoothly.
Violence is ordinary employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are sensible and peaceful people, "says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in Finland on Friday.
Friday's protest is exceptional in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, "says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisäinen, Professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Well, it's no wonder the ay movement is protesting.
If it didn't do that, it would raise its hands in front of the government, "she says.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is not in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that are really trying to get the ay movement down on its knees.
At the same time, there is also a place to look in the mirror on the ay-motion.
The mirror is needed, for example, because there is certainly no support for all employees on the way to Friday's demonstrations.
What is now new is the sharp division that the protest will bring about in the group that the AU would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered in different parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, "says Murrostorstai, Siisainen, which was held in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed people.
The government of Esko Aho (central) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government and the ay movement may be even worse off than in the days of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, "says Siisainen.
The current coalition of governments is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing, despite what the Finns have said.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement in the days of the blitz.
On Friday, several thousand demonstrators are expected to be present.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
About 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, there have been quite peaceful demonstrations in the Finnish AU movement - even though the methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, "says Siisainen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to wear pig shit.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes among pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electricity strikes in the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the Metalmen strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Conciliation Board after the strike lasted for seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages all over the country.
Murrostorstai, 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people met in front of the House of Commons, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, to express their support for the work.
Firefighters were on strike for three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were hit by egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," said one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers poured tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and smoke hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
In 2007, he threatened a strike and a mass retirement of nurses.
In the end, the threat of mass redundancies accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors were on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced strike" was the slogan of the doctor on strike in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted about five months and led to a lively debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched on behalf of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament building in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police are investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in finding out the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and primary responsibility are at the scene of the incident in Austria, "says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Kähradio, who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company carries out restaurant activities and its managing director is a man of foreign background, approximately 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A rich smuggler's king, a violent boat driver, a classy missionary and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, these people are smuggling people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist working at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers," and the book they wrote about Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present the tentacles of trafficking in human beings, put forward solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisian people are headed there to spend the summer.
In terms of their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as it is only 120 kilometres away from the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for fishermen to transport people.
That's what Emir has been doing with his blue 10-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If you fill the boat, you can fit 40 people.
After one trip, Emir makes about 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisian people wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as it takes.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if customers run out of money, that is their problem.
We're leaving for the water at midnight with an extinguished lantern.
The first night you drive away from the islands, then you stop, wait the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is going on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat them to death.
He says in the book that when the police saw him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one and threw them overboard," says Emir in the book.
The quietest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's got to beat up his fellow countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good, his starter engine is running its last few days, and he's seen his best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 km southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family are staying in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private apartments, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally entering the Bogovaða region, the great hub of human smuggling, people are dying tired.
Goran's people are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are the Syrians, he tells us in a book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly goo-goo all the way.
For example, a price of EUR 300 will be agreed first, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice man with a good heart.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, "he says in the book.
Goran says that he is working cheaper than others and that he is only charging EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 300 miles away, most of it comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a pleasant annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shakes away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and that's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda's capital, where there are many believers who have escaped from the Congo, and a small centre to help the Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are being transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He shines his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and to move on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the five numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money carefully and slip among the traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, you must tell them that you are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that you have had to flee your home with violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
That will help the missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: to the asylum application procedure, to the NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: it costs about EUR 100 to submit an application to the Ugandan police force, about 150 documents to the humanitarian organisation, and the migration process, for example, in a European country, between EUR 4 500 and EUR 7 000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people on trucks on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan driver living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving off the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tom picks the right truck, we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not to Holland, for example, and cut off the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but it's more expensive than that.
When the route is clear, Tom will wrap his client in aluminum foil, the same one they wrap around a roast or an oven potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police heat scanner from noticing who was hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene in the hope that the driver won't pick up any stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The infamous Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury vessel scam: Turkish ports rent pleasure boats supposedly to take American or European families to a few days' tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghan citizens who are being transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must get on the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, for there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury vessel trip after the cost.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, landlords and other smaller agents to do the work for him.
During the summer season, transport takes place at least hundreds and Küçük makes millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 apartments he rents through shell companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Book of the Travel Bureau of Death will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In a book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published clippings of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in state of the art and ran for the second best time in the tryouts.
But in the final, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he stormed into the front and defended his lead in a manic run.
But 150 meters before the goal, his powers were exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, "says Favor Hamilton in his book.
Later, it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when he became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of having money to have sex with strange men.
He also convinced his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he missed the kind of adrenaline spikes he'd been getting when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's statistic number one at 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic finals.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straight-back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Association have been twisting the whole summer and autumn from last year's athletes' agreement.
Although the alliance has offered Northung a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for many world champions and Olympic champions.
As a result of the contractual dispute, the Norwegian Association of Skiers decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision received thanks from the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northung is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the national team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a union that would also take care of future generations and would not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that the alliance has given Northung economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
Northug published his own press release on Tuesday, in which he assured us that he wanted to exercise in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as at the World Cup and the Olympic Games afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in his career, including two gold medals.
Last winter, he was a member of a team in Falun that won message gold.
Shining day for roasting translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Turkeyday 25.9. there will be a series of tricks in different restaurants and shops that have been awarded the Bake Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food know-how and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of a high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator are found all over Finland.
The international attention of the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurant Fonds and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the restaurant in Old Town will take part in the Shield Day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events of the organisation, which will take place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhakoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Office and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the former garrison of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure in the region during the crisis period, which is used by the armed forces and its partner, Suomen Isolliskotkunta Oy.
Kauharoki magazine explains that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in a single building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Airfield School, the effect of which has not also been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been taking place over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport in Kauhava airport.
This issue has been discussed with the Minister of Defence, Jussi Niinistö (p.), and Arto Rädy, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but that the intended place in the former military area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava dealt with the matter of the reception centre last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö will comment to journalists at night after meeting the chairmen of all the parliamentary parties in his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern for managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the Baltic Sea region.
So much hope for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tense situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Mr Nielsson, the issue of NATO was also raised in the debates.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
A demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the Helsinki city centre.
The police say that the streets leading to the Iron Road Square will be shut down from the cars around 9.30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheimintie, no cars will be allowed towards the railway station in Kaivokatu, Postkatu and Töölönlahdenkatu.
From Union street in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union street at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles shall be allowed in the area.
Underground and track drivers all Friday in a demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from morning to night traffic.
The Association of Railways and Subways told the STT this evening.
Most of the Alkos close for two hours, including mail closed
Friday's protest also disrupts Post's services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the points of service in the mail are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are carried out despite the strike.
There is also an effort to deal with catering and hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can find information about the services on the Post website.
Most of the Finnish Alkhas close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11: 00 and 13: 00.
Pam has also called on the workers of the grocery trade to participate in the demonstrations of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko will tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with the help of supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, any closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki daycare centres partially closed
Helsingin daycare centres are not fully operational on Friday, informed by the Finnish Agency for Early Education in Helsinki.
Due to the demonstrations by trade unions, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and the clubs of kindergartens and playground parks are not organised.
24-hour crèches and groups of mentally disabled children and children with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of mentally disabled and autistic school pupils are organised normally.
The National Education Agency promises to keep you informed of any changes in activity tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Mr Sipilä, there is a need for a wide range of channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in Parliament.
Mr Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle's channels in the future.
If any other channels report as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Mr Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio speech for citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä's taking a big risk.
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television speech will not tell us more about the government turning inwards.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more firmly into its own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions?
Reminds me of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The means of communication of political decision-makers are not a matter of announcement in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that politicians' agendas are not included.
Koivusen says that TV talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Mr Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Are there any more of what we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old ones, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this sense, too, we are taking a risk if it is not a specific situation, but a routine speech.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a messenger of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or with the general line.
Sneaky, cunning bet.
In the forthcoming speech by Mr Sipilä, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher points out.
In the evening you should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where not, says Heikki Kitti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Six, the TV speech is a cunning move by Sipilä, because this will allow him to bring out his own view without the gravel sounds.
This will give the message a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no more specific questions can be asked.
Six says it's very important for Sipilä to appear on TV - the currency sweat, the hands trembling.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can make a good presentation, it can work.
The situation is different from the situation if the government were to inform you about something, because here you are talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do on a regular basis (President Barack of the United States).
Very exceptional.
Erkka Railo, the political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional to the public.
He said that there has been no such thing for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, "says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is the way the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise a demonstration and strikes against the government's actions.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, says that Sipilä could address the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss it.
Antti Rinne (sd.), President of the SDP, says that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon to be six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine when we found him.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inner Finland also confirms the case to the Evening Press.
The kid went out to play around 4: 00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, they couldn't reach him anymore.
My dad thanks everyone who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You create anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish-background free fighter, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a very strong speech against young people's street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both professional fights in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells me he's disappointed with the youth fad.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick people in the country, sit on top of the other one, and hit them blindly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people on the videos are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Helsinki Police Commissioner, fighting videos have been downloaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of these individual cases.
A little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You make me hate things I don't like either.
Things are pretty bad for you guys anyway, and you're not going to cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK's position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The SAK President, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STT on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STT proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Federation of Staff Representatives (STT) announced that it would present to the government its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, believes that the proposal will be approved by the government if the SAK, STT and Akava are all behind it.
However, it would require the SAK, the largest employee organisation, to soften its previous position.
The President of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a narrow comment on the subject on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
He said that the SAK was looking for solutions to "open up the labour market" and that instead of enforced laws, agreements between active parties were needed.
Mr Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Mr Sipilä cut off negotiations for a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity leap.
Comment: The big protest is threatening to go, "It feels a little funny to shake your fist"
It does seem a little funny to shake your fist, if you already have a make-up paper written by Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from one side to the other in the employee camp.
Is it the intention to call off the government or to settle with it?
On Monday, the Federal leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred for the Government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being caught.
The threat spread through the headlights as well.
The teachers' union, OAJ, threatened the closure of schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the O.A.J. cancelled: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the Confederation of Workers' Unions (STT), appeared conciliatory.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity cut, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle).
The president of Akava, Sture Fjäder (Kok), was in a hurry to announce that his agreement was already ready.
The SAK office didn't hear a peep at first.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to reconcile when the federal leaders told the country to stand up on Friday just Monday.
At the end of the day, however, Mr Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions for "opening the labour market lock."
In order for the joint presentation of the employees to take place, the SAK should agree to a 5% productivity leap target.
There is no wonder that Palolan SRTT is well-connected with the government of Sipilä.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ihaus, Director of Social Impact of the STT, was previously a special assistant to Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi, Prime Ministers of the Centre.
Palola therefore describes the government's ability to act as a member of the board as having improved.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a boost from the Finnish stands, whose foreface is the ACP's Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it feels a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Additional information about Lyle's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, thought that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly began, in which Mr Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebrations.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Mr Naryshkin, on the European Union's list of sanctions, to appear at the meeting - something that the President was able to remind journalists of.
It was our assessment that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin was stressed by the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Mr Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he had also been denied access.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, declared by Mr Naryshkin.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation entered without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued his Finnish stings by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation."
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolia leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation, leading the meeting in Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The Tapper and the Clave will continue the bull days in Hakaforest today, while both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real goal party in Hakaforest tonight.
Tappa went to Kuopio last night to drill for a 3-2 overtime victory over KalPa.
The rise was manly because last season's silver group was at its worst two-goal loss position.
The lock's Tuesday was a little more humongous.
Blues, who started the Raunismen 'spoils in a narrow way, was visited by a round zero point, and also by a loss figure of 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Clave-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates positions on the club's website.
The killing has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Syrians.
In fact, in the last two periods, the killer has dropped out of the final series of the Clave.
Both times, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three by the side and by.
With the exception of goaltenders, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The two cashiers who rejected us both yesterday are going to get a flute shift today.
With the goal of Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the Clave poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan ZApolski.
View: A terrible play running in the ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote to head coach Rautakallio an inappropriate sequel, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a film called Rocky, in which he himself played the leading role.
The underdog sensationally put up a heavyweight for the world champion, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's opening night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden pot patch went on to amaze everyone in the Finnish Championship finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but resilient underdogs like Rocky.
There was white Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the irokees.
Toivola became blonde.
JP Jalo, the great TV reporter, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that the novelty work of this season works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sportsman for aces has built a pot of spades on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been smashing guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than hockey.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
The Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Tale into Sean Connery.
The Iron Tale is as clumsy a lead artist as Connery was in the original of 1976 in Toivola's script in Rocky.
There's no Rocky in the iron tank but a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Throne does not include barging and squabbling.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Ases tackled Tappara in the head of Jere Karelia.
He got 2 + 10 minutes from the judges, but the Iron Thunder put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
The only people who play for us are the ones who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to the ace puck, the hot Iron Dull rained after the game to the people of Satakunta.
The ace team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and troublemakers.
There are practically no key men of the best game age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the skill deficit.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's under the surface.
The Year1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in becoming a sports manager in Toivola.
The men's contracts end in the spring.
The aces' balance in the three league games of the season is equal in number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laugh.
He has been married to the former bass player and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but now Olga's first acting under Tuukka's guidance.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanna made us beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka is stepping up and supporting her son, even though her father Risto (represented by Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two of them have come a long way.
They've met, they've spoken on the phone, they've been texting.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little color.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become Finland's largest band.
Back in the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really sad.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some kind of intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that he had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before his movie plans.
But sometimes the stories of the parents have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his youth was completely different from Tuukan, known as Heinola's notorious skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the movie.
At the most, she could have been secretly attracted to him.
According to Olga, he's worked so hard with Tuukka over the last 10 years, the big joint project doesn't scare him.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often intends to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, simply asking which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland's most expensive play film
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The next part of the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be Finland's most expensive play film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation that is under way will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over EUR 100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been so relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time is tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he's gonna tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of between 8 and 10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor too.
The film could, however, be crammed into 100 million because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no loose end.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Hillbilly or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts.
The trendsetters' breasts have recently been decorated with large logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the label of a hoodie or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sporttius has become a real fashion mega trend, and so have the old, familiar sporttikaupunki characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness of the wave.
And as has been the case so often, the line between funny and trendy is thin: if something is already a hillbilly, it becomes ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the mundane fashion in which trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of grey elementary college, they're putting on the top of the closet that's already buried in a sweatshirt with the manufacturer's logo on it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' recognizable track sweats, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
The beginning of the edge of the jeans is now a cool detail for the Calvin Klein logos in the underwear.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing is at stake.
Would you be willing to show me the logos in your dress?
A Russian politician published proof that I didn't get stuck in a tank for hours!
It was claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
Over the past few days, the Russian media has been hearing colorful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency has had to remove the large Zotov tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of the armoured vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on those images, it is not about getting stuck or angry.
That's a load of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went in, looked around, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Prakda.
I didn't get stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition because he was a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was so interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I definitely intend to visit all tanks and all assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else kept repeating.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and rosy, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged obstruction have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started with the Bloknot.ru case, where Zotovin was told that he was storming out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to finally shoot everyone around him if he can't get out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition gave their views on the event.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply tarried when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator to Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknott.
This is the favorite piece of interior bloggers.
The Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) of the Architects' brothers, the Lassen candlestick from 1962, looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
Architectural brothers are known to have worked on the shape of the candlestick for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was first introduced only to the distinguished gentlemen's dinner guests.
The Kubus candlesticks are made by the family company by By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of reputable brothers.
The candles are made by hand in Holstebro, Denmark, in the form of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
You can get it in black, white, nickel and copper.
The candlestick is topical right now and is suitable for a wide range of homes.

There has been a leak at the Kittilän mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been taken.
The pool has neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
In general, the water is pumped either for re-use as process water or channelled as authorised through the surface casting field into the environment.
The estimated bleeding rate was approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
It was the only material that leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuopämäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely in line with the views of the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation was pushing Finland for comprehensive structural reforms to deal with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
According to Pasi Kuoppämäki, the chief economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
There is a lot of complacent message in the IMF's assessment of government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, investments in infrastructure, Kuoppamäki says to Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to have an economic growth of 0.4 per cent this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new economic forecast, Danske expects growth to remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, "says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few per cent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, starts work on Wednesday, "Nintendo told on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, assessed by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as the strong inclusion of Nintendo in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of the traditional game consoles.
More and more minors are arriving in Finland alone.
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear each year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is this the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear under the ground in a year? - In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made to a single minor in Finland.
Nine of them went missing.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, "Kannelmaa says.
The reason for this disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to deal with the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were closed because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, "he says.
Is it growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a single minor.
There are still no overall statistics on missing minors for asylum seekers this year, but the number of minors is therefore well known and has increased considerably, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to people who have a reverse decision?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "black market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Mr Kannelmaa stresses.
The Minister for the Interior, Petteri Orpo (Kok), has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Council of Ministers of the Interior, reported on practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A's studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector, who has lost his ability to work because of illness scenes, is now on the market.
Nina Mikkonen, married to Mikkonen, sells devices that were once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The first news about the online ad was the online magazine Iltamakasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has fallen under technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that you'll find someone interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is old generation material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking to IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkosset are trying to move out of their present home in Thurskylä.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I have gradually begun to inventory and see what goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, "says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use of TV and radio equipment.
It is clear from recent brain attacks that a man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's real life work was archived as early as the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to collect films and other material from Myrskylä with boxes.
Transport threatens to pore worse than we thought: Metro and tram can stop all Friday
Today, metro and tram drivers decide whether to expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stand by metro and tram traffic only during a demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon it will be resolved whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief trustee, says that the threat is great in the field.
The cutbacks on night and shift tickets are killing the drivers, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise resistance.
Mr Hirvonen says that standing up for the whole day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops by Friday, public transport in the Greater Helsinki area will virtually be at a standstill.
According to VR's records, trains don't run Friday between 6: 00 a.m. and 6: 00 p.m.
On Friday, there will be no commuter or long-distance traffic.
The trains that left before 6: 00 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the depot.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday from 3: 00 a.m. to 3: 00 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the leadership, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus shifts are scheduled for Friday.
Wage and salary earners' organisations will organise a major demonstration at Rautatientori in Helsinki on Friday from 11 a.m. to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says the news agency AP.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to the local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas. His teacher thought he was a bomb on his own.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher considered the homemade watch she brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was introduce his electronics hobby to the proceeds.
But one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the police had found that the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The case took place last Monday and Mohamedia was punished for three days' compulsory leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether it is yet another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is shaking - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism made by the right-wing press has also been shared by the Members of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has been an insult to the people, who thought it was a Labour Member of Parliament, Kate Green, in a radio interview with the BBC Broadcasting Corporation.
Green thought Corby should have gone along with the song.
Yesterday's memorial ceremony was a tribute to the battle of British air force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party, in its official statement, defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all deeply indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corby) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement underlined.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the Labour ranks.
In particular, there are those among the MPs who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Today, for the first time, Mr Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament as a party leader at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corby has asked the public for proposals on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron roam on Twitter for the election of Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister treferred in his own account.
The cause of Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
The South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a week of family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three kids with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school had been concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went into the house for a checkup and found the Short family dead across the country in a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Minnetonka is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com. for nurses.
In 2014, in the interview with StarTribune Short reported that there are four million different visitors per week.
I've had 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was seen in the fact that the Short family bought a hilarious house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on a property site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also enough garage for eight cars.
The trial is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Asieve Test Prep, offering various preparatory courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to the Asieve Test Prep, the comments that slandered the preparation courses had not been removed from the Short site and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffees.
In addition, the owner-trio was awarded the Finnish horse owner's prize for the month Hippos.
This is great, Loiri comments in a good mood on his honorary board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the great competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the Success Horse will get Loir to work with him in full peace of mind.
Pekka rules and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut the fuck up, Loiri.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star - "The greatest donation of all time by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million a year.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will be given the hospital's name-bearing lobby space.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
One year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same child hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the necessary PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife from a Japanese coffee shop tonight - only bikini food and an apron on top
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a halibut and now a wife's cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sociable and the hungry.
It's Metro.
You can order a wife or husband at the Ore no Yome (Finnish wife) café in Tokyo for the evening.
We're talking about a waitress pretending to be the wife of a client.
The "spouse" will be selected from the list before entering the café and he will prepare and serve the food.
The wife is up against nothing but an apron and a bikini, and the husband is in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the candidates for a wife, always on what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: attacks against the security of cars began to be armed.
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in this field, "says Intel.
The Board is made up of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections with the aim of standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber security solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report based on the results of the ASRB study.
The international ICT research and consultation company, Gartner, estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, "says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can consolidate best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important element in the design of each connected vehicle.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as if it were rising on the moon.
Finally, the car is beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world's eyes are at the Frankfurt auto show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS is accelerating with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting by Finnish, and it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, though when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell us in his release.
The favorite Kia introduced two new features to the Frankfurt car show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two new Finnish ones.
The Sportage created by the new European Design Director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than before.
The wheelbase and the exterior dimensions have come in one inch here and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but it has been added to 177 turbo of 1.6 litres of horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to sales.
It will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with improved driving characteristics, lower noise levels and better equipment.
The first step is to get the Optimos equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT with a 2.0 litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu came back to the stage... flashed in a bold jumpsuit.
The singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue suit has an impressive, open neck opening.
The costume presents beautifully the scatter waist of a singer star.
The size is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, a singer who became a mother has been able to lose the weight by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn a year.
The singer released his first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on stage and getting in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, "the singer says.
Chisu will be publishing his new album called Polaris in a few weeks' time.
The new life situation has inspired us to write new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people are going to find my new album, Chisu is going to think.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astonishing again.
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives one topic after another.
He shows his pregnancy stomach and chest bras in a very sexy outfit, last night at 1: 00 in the American time, when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the husband's Kanye West gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent on the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity dress, he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week's Friday, when pregnancy was on display.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model, Manon Leloup, wanted to correct the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary "Speating Dolls" in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar brought together the six hard truths of Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the last season you would have written in top designer costumes, the new season will start again in Casting.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with the bad guys.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for years with a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are wanted jobs, but they are more stressful than anyone else.
There's not just one kind of weight.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop a kilo, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks run out, the difference is a bit of a bitch.
Models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just about showing off clothes.
Models want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in a model's work.
The models for the Tory Burch show last night.
New York is currently hosting fashion weeks where designers will reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apilanta musician in the film.
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wironen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitar player, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to see the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in that group, so I think it's all right if I just learn his style from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
The man who's piloting the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play the role.
The punk-maneers come naturally to the man.
Stars, in the punk show of the stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw their first taste, as well if they've ever been to our shows.
Our performance has never been so cute, but we always go to the full.
The leading actors in the "Teit Beautiful" film directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna in 1993-2004.
The core group of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is represented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
Drumpali Sipe Santapuk is played by Teppo Mainer, singer Toni Wurosta Tatu Sinasalo Basist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which she has had to implement for the film.
The Scrooge, previously seen in the moustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to silos and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to wonder over the past few days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me about it at all?
There is no need to force the matter, as a member of the SPR crisis group, the psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children and not allowing them, for example, to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can be kept spinning around in their minds and distressing, "he says.
However, if the child has come across television news about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a debate on the basis of the child and to listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child for nothing, even if you're anxious and scared.
A smaller child is closely following their parents' behaviour.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Bigger children are likely to run into a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It's good for parents to bring it up with them if they're wondering about the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe place or a unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety wherever possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermouth-hitting Ball Flash difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to sharpen Apila's ball salama in the middle of summer.
It only rained victories and second places until the end of July in Tampere there was a collapse.
Because the stallion froze completely, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protégé time from the vet.
The explanation for the exhaustion was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not a less severe disease, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Ball salama had to exercise light, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was in Turku in record time another SE mare after Tarunälä.
The Spallsalama of Apila was very pressurised by the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the small deflection at the end was understandable, "says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a difference to the stallion.
The horse's hymn must have moved on from there, and hopefully it would have stabilized as well.
Apila's Ball salama has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not funny, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, on the other hand, the stallion has been cut off by such a lightning bolt that the adversaries have been amazed.
In short speed, the rivals can't handle the Ball salama, which even has warm-blooded rides.
The wishes of the North are a peesy run in Vermo.
But the difference is how the Spallalama of Apila agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you leave, and you could stick a needle under the boom in the truck and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than Turku's departure.
Apila's Ball salama can also come out of the bow when he's in shape, and we're going to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be able to be deleted - but not all of them.
Apple intends to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, "says Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed.
In Apple's iPhone you can find a set of programs that are relatively few to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Lehkioski, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart clock owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area slowed to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, as reported today by Eurostat, the EU statistical authority.
The rise in the prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% forecast a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation stood at 0.2%.
The so-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the EU-28, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise amounted to 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, from the euro countries.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU Harmonised Index of Price Index.
The inflation rate in the euro area is still persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a 2% price increase over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, and the Central Bank will anticipate its release at the beginning of September in its new inflation forecasts.
The US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after Fed's central bank takes up interest rates again for a long time.
And in financial markets, the downturn will start before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he might start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession will be able to press on at its fastest by next autumn and in the course of the financial markets before it.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have done in the past - and if they react to the tightening of Feb's money supply as they have done in the past.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the strategy of the London market survey of Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international clients last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Feb's interest rate increases.
In addition to their historical observations, they will examine which key economic and financial variables are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rate increases - and what the consequences might be.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky state to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession.
The leaders who decide on Feb's monetary policy and its current stance have been suggesting throughout the summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates for over nine years can happen this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Feb Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called "Fed funds' steering rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a series of relatively regular but at a time of exactly two years, of small increases in interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a world-wide doomsday nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically happened since the previous interest rate increases in Feb.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and more harsh than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Since 1950, and in some cases since the beginning of the 19th century, Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rise and fall of the world's largest economies and the turmoil of financial markets.
Feb's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact are being reported by them since the 1950s.
The first increase in interest rates has reached a peak of less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Feb's interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, Fed has in turn increased and decreased its steering rate by a dozen cycles of different sizes.
Each time there has been a deviation from some of the others, and times are relatively limited in the analysis, so it is unlikely that any certainty can be drawn from the effects of the subsequent increases in interest rates.
The strategies therefore point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably identified, even by decades of research.
However, three factors which have led to the crisis and which have increased its destructive power are well known:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks and growing the next one at the same time.
(2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive debt in different parts of the financial and real economy increased further as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy was created.
(3) In particular, the low-cost debt financing, which was almost unstoppable in the financial sector, increased most of the financial markets' main price bubbles from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities in their economic history.
It is unlikely that there will be a very severe dispute either that the financial markets, which were raised to the heights by increasingly complex debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when Fed and the other central banks last drove interest rates upwards.
The underlying financial structures, as well as the valuation bubbles, were not able to last more than a few days after interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not speculate on what is going to happen next, but give reason to think, for example:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they are now even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been cheap as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now in various parts of the economy there is a much heavier debt burden than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity that has been issued more slowly and cheaply from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has dampened key securities and assets to their highest cost, whether at the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
In addition, they note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession in the way it has been in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks of financial markets are comparatively higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening up its money supply.
Perhaps the image of the future of Albert Edwards, the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it might seem.
He has been preparing international investors for the following full translations by Feb for a good time:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it will be time for Fedi to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE raids.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which makes computers and printers, intends to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP's corporate services sector, "says the company.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company dedicated to business sales, and HP Inc., a company dedicated to pc machines and printers for consumers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off expenses of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
The reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 over three years.
HP intends to relocate its activities to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the year before last, its three most significant customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system to iPhone after the Apple update release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, click "General" and then select "Software Update."
If the update is ready, the phone will allow the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when an error message "Software Upgrade Failed" appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications in order to obtain space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes the applications to be deleted and then reinstall them upon completion of the update.
Make sure the phone is loaded or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the load level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery runs out in the middle of the battery, it may lead to the upgrade being broken.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the tax havens company
According to Mr Yle, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Anne Berner, has acted as a member of the board of the tax havens company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board of directors were appointed as Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner remains officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he has submitted a resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a letter of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed time frame, "Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Sul, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-level ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelian-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company received a request for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, "Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs' capital fund, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a business-run reception centre opens
In Otaniemi, Espoo opens its first reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 persons per week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
Luuna Oy is operated by Luona Oy, which is specifically active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the Centre.
STT is preparing an alternative labour market tightening package
STT is starting to prepare an alternative package for the tightening of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to see other employee federations involved.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists on a break from the organisation's administration.
Mr Palola felt that the Economic Union (EK) was not prepared for discussions.
The economists of the STT have calculated that the change security contained in the government's competitiveness package costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party is terribly excited to have a conversation if you're on the receiving side of a one-to-100 relationship.
Palola: The negotiating relationship has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, cutting Sundays is a sore place for the staff member's organisation at the STT airport.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is implementing part of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, SCT is not warmed up by the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the present SDP.
Wage and salary earners will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the labour blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of illness is cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The emphasis is on the fact that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and that the aim was not to strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, commends the announcement by STT of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Mr Fjäder, STT is now in line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined for a longer time in Akava.
Mr Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
The President of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Mr Antti Palolan STT explained earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it had been preparing for a long time its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive edge sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, "says President Sture Fjäder.
Mr Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to Akava's line, as has been done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
Together we are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, "says Fjäder.
The Bureau of Akava will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

Viva's bingo coupon for the Green Left at the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, Prime Ministers have made special speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05 p.m.
In the run-up to the previous Prime Minister's speech, we must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers made a number of radio speeches during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s Esko Aho made a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the train operators' strike with a television speech.
Single phone calls, monarchist stuff.
Sipilä's speech has aroused criticism and speculation all day about what should come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said: "Mr Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss it."
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja from the SDP condemned "the monarchist style: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it."
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is the fear of @ juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Treasury, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented live by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lylly, and the CEO of EK, Jyri Häkähäman.
The public has been criticised for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was part of the public service mission to promote public access throughout Finland, a line in the news by Yle's Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle.
♪ Like us in the time of the Oaks ♪
The speech has also aroused grotesque mockery.
When the evening comes, the dinner will be served in good time, the children will be combed and dressed in their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest lump, and my dad's trying on his tie.
At 9: 00 a.m., the TV will be silenced like the old days, "writes Saku Timonen, the blogger.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens who are drawing up amnesty laws for other tax evaders, while at the same time telling the people that they are forced to cut when the state is out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It's posted a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the debt and the team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to replace al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad out of power, says President Martti Ahtisaari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan which, after some time, would have allowed Al-Assad to withdraw from power in style.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in just a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral debate: no arms to the opposition, no direct contact between the opposition and Al-Assad, and the renunciation of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember in an interview with Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment.
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate to the press, but Ahtisaari said that there were no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but they said that Al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused all agreements with which he would remain in power.
The former head of the Middle East branch of the British Foreign Ministry, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said because, in his experience, Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me what Mr Tshurkin said, I would have said that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep control of one of Al-Assad's supporters.
♪ A stream of refugees ♪ ♪ For what we've done ♪
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, around 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The Centre for the Organisation of Asylum Seekers has pushed them to Tornio
The Centre for the organisation of asylum seekers, designed by the Government for Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the city center in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Intoppinen, Vice-President of Tornio City Council (left), this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on it, he will make it clear to the STT.
36 delegates from 43 were present at the debate.
The organizational center was opposed to 13 delegates.
You could expect the decision to be positive, "says Intoppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received a contact on Monday and a rapid response was made.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be able to join the community.
The expert has gone to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work even in that sense, "Nousiainen says.
Mr Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (mid-term), halving the holiday money in public would only be part of the government's aim to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such an option.
Mr Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the labour market blackmail announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
Mr Sipilä felt that halving the holiday money would be a means, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the cuts planned by the government for Sunday allowances.
The social partners could agree among themselves to cut the holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements rather than in law.
On Wednesday next week, the Board of Directors will report to Parliament on the blackmailing of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Mr Sipilä, the organisations' proposals should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then be on the move, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won't take long for these things, if there is a will, Sipilä did.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of finale and helaThursday into unpaid days off without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is reduced, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation by trade unions, which has provoked strong criticism.
In addition to a major demonstration on Friday by wage and salary union organisations, political strikes have been announced by a number of trade unions.
Tohmajärvi council approved sahlahalli warehouse expansion
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the extension of Nordic Koivu Oy's hangar or sahlahalli warehouse, but slightly grumbling.
The criticism was due to the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally mentioned.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little puzzled that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting Erkki Ikonen, the technical director, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the local area.
There is no risk for the municipality as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) argued.
A place for the language of Karelia in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous firm stance to bring street name signs in Karjalainen to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of upholding the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not proclaim to be the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastward smokescreen dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre in the Karelian language.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared, on a case-by-case basis, to use the Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth being open to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of all Finland.
Both of them can very well be used for a wide range of marketing activities in the province.
Disconnection of trains cuts the regional vitality
The cuts in the train connections will hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport links have a direct impact on the regional economy and competitiveness.
And it does affect the fact that we can live and work here at all, "says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, the extension of which has also been mentioned several times in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not reduce our chances of coping with government measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of the connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services there are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland because of the poor transverse connections.
At present, about one-half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, around 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
A voice of gravel came from the mouth of the river to the battle of Siu
The view of the City Council of Joensuu on the regional Siun Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel is one.
The City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) at the Monday meeting of the Board of Directors proposed that the entire project should be abandoned, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains will be less frequent.
The passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One pair of trains is left out, but still five times a day you get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
These reductions are the result of government austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely abolished.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old climbing up the roof who couldn't get off the roof on his own.
The situation was born in Tornionmäki on Ketotie around 6: 30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It didn't stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateurs' mast next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
The result was that other people were running away and the passers alerted the rescue services to help with the last safe return to the earth on the roof of the drawers.
FedEx's operating profit is double, reducing the outlook for the 2016 tax year
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the supplier cut the entire year's profit forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during holidays.
During this period last year FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Its share fell by around 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects next May to end the tax year with a result of between $10.40 and $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
The analysts waited for $10.84, let's go to the FactSet questionnaire.
The lower outlook came in spite of an average price increase of 4.9%, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite higher charges for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to increase ever more from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The President and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "will perform firmly in the light of weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in terms of production and global trade."
Plans for salaries during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS announced that he intended to employ between 90 and 95 000 extra employees, about the same amount as he hired last year.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's earnings amounted to USD 692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is below the average estimate of $2.44. The 12 analysts' survey was carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to USD 12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport, which has halted the development of the turnover of its Express unit.
However, the increase in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the national unit rose by 29 per cent, but the revenue of the operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx's shares fell to $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11% down on Tuesday for this year and 17% below the June 11 record.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative two-storey conference room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the nation before everything else.
Congress has placed two responsibilities on the central bank: they must maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
After the great recession, however, central bank governors have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, that the US economy is ready to be weaned away from the record incentive that has been brought about by the short-term interest rates that have remained almost zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made bank officials on their guard even more alarmist when it comes to increasing instability; it is feared that if the federal fund rate reference value were to be raised by at least one percentage point a quarter.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief finance expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for not restoring interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the Central Bank, which is already causing the economy to be nervous.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the Central Bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank does not raise the level unless the decision-makers manage to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the Central Bank would keep the level unchanged this week, "says John Lonski, Chief Financial Officer of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It is surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must make a lot of effort in their alignment to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an elevated level would reassure the financial markets by removing uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago it appeared that this month the Central Bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Mr Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the limit on full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers claim that this is the main reason for this is the temporary impact of a significantly lower oil price.
The economy "survives and needs higher interest rates, taking into account the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, the chief finance expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16% from its May record when investors feared that China's slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells you when interest rates need to be raised.
"Without these financial market events and the recent weeks' coverage of the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, Special Investigator at UCLA Zima Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still rather unclear and they have little information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China," says Oliner.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank has had enormous influence.
In 2013, the suggestion by the then President, Ben S. Bernanke, that the Central Bank could "narrow" the amount of money, caused upheaval in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, the global strategy manager of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of the State of Virginia in Richmond, pointed out this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements which appear to be separate from economic fundamentals."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, calls for an example of the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, these cuts were overturned by the Federal Reserve.
The central bank should give priority to financial stability only during the major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest-fixing committee.
The latest turmoil does not come near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants a situation in which interest rate increases are feared because the market is getting upset," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double requirement and does not mention financial stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Children's Association in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Children's Association SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breast feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with pictures of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of different proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that increasing the amount of calorie is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven-channel Sunrise program is a favorite in ratings, despite Nine channel's efforts to broadcast the director's revelation in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the liberal party's leader revelation failed to increase the ratings of Today.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull derailed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The TV viewers in Australia did not seem to be affected by the weight of the distance, as Sunris had an average of 397 000 in five state capitals, compared to 339 000 in Today.
The Today average rose slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318 000 and for Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators, compared to 314 000 at Today.
This is the most interesting event of all morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800 Word series with the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with two children.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson is the sole driving force of a popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
The results of last night gave this real certainty.
The X Factor program was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838 000) and TBL Familes (726 000).
There was a double fate on Seven the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new game show gathered 446 000 admissions.
The second half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 spectators - which was small enough to win from Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour rating was 520,000 admissions, and the second half-hour was a huge 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night audience average will give Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the ratings of the McGuire program.

The final three agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before the Thursday finals.
All three women were poetic when they told how Wood was a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positivity as the reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?" their answers could provide an indication of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after their own.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah) the energies and the energies of Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very earthy, and it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be having a nice and relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's homecoming meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game," he said, "I'm all in this with my heart."
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls that are left just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7: 30 on Ten.
Originally released under the name "Sarah's best option for Sam Wood"?
Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight back when the team won Minnesota Tuesday with a reading of 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a spade in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers' special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Platoon Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flying kick Minnesota Vikings picked up in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the start Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the airport after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio harness Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start in his NFL career.
"It's just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his oxidation to his 2007 Origin debut when the pitch in his own target area led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game Hayne posed for his Instagram account in a photo published with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yuko was seized and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 died when the police shot rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal following the shooting of rubber bullets by the police into a crowd that was demonstrating against the country's new draft Constitution, the Authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the senior official in the region, said that more than 1000 demonstrators had been gathered outside the police station and some of them were throwing rocks and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
This was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new Constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The co-legislators have voted this week on the draft Constitution in Katmandu and the authorities have said that the new Charter should be adopted by Sunday.
United States National Hurricane Center NHC says there's a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde.
The wide low pressure front, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde archipelago, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre told us on Tuesday.
The second sensitive low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde archipelago and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google launches a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at raising 11 million dollars to humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees in Europe escape war torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective when publishing the donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of being reported by the Director, the Google employee, Rita Masoud, who, at the age of seven, fled Kabul with his family, wrote about his own personal experience.
"There were many dark train and bus trips along the way, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: doctors without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told us that it corresponds with the same amount to every donation made worldwide on Google.com / Refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diet surgery can help slightly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefit of weight loss surgery in mild obese type 2 diabetic patients may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these slightly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It will take a long time to get death data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight-cutting expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in the JAMA Surgery magazine.
In the case of weight loss or bariatrisi, different methods are used to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been morbidly obese and have had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, the weight ratio to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the person's BMI is more than 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, to the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The study showed that the mean BMI of the surgeries decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained roughly the same in 29 persons treated with other means than surgery.
Thirty-six per cent of the surgeries showed complete and 28% partial improvements in diabetes.
For comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by approximately 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-cholestine were generally better in the surgical group, "the authors noted.
Researchers also monitored patients' blood haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect blood glucose levels over the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, written by researchers.
After surgery, the level of haemoglobin A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control," as described by improved hemoglobin levels, did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says Chief Investigator Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year when compared with the gastric reduction group, the gastric bypass graft group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin levels more than its A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetic remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
The Swedish study found that obesity during weight loss surgery was 29% less likely to die over a 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the studies are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group," he says, "and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously when the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when man has collected these genetic changes, which permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compaction in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, which is dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should take precedence over individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, "he added.
In taking a position on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused the chain to be violent.
"After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem would be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences, "said the Dalai Lama.
Over the last four years, the ingestion of a hand disinfectant in children has increased fourfold.
Toxic Focal Points across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400% in the intake of a high-alcohol hand disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, "says the Georgian Poison Information Centre.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, the cases of ingestion of disinfectant in the poison control centres in children under 12 years of age, from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 in 2014, were reported by the Director of the Toxic Information Centre in Georgia.
"Children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them go to the emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap uplift.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-rich mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Comfortable fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child does not think that this is bad for him," said Lopez.
Many of the more interesting (hand desks) are the ones with the added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45% and 95%.
In young children in particular, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Director of the Poison Information Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
So don't leave the whiskey shots lying on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left out, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who swallowed only four syringes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult DUI, says the emergency clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When he was talking, he couldn't walk when he came to the emergency room.
The doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible symptoms of brain damage, since alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, "Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and move disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontarian women died from ingestion of hand disinfectant containing toxic, unreported ingredients.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, reported in a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour mill: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths disdain speeches about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he can turn it around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football League against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on alert for January recruits that could disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increased his lead on Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference with Celtic to five points.
Griffiths belittles the talk of contradictions.
There have been rumours of conflicts within Celtic, but Griffiths immediately overtook them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more careful scrutiny when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of Scottish championships is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers' midfield player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the title with the Rangers.
The present ambassador of Ajax, Mr de Boer, said: "In Holland, the highlights of Celtic games are no longer displayed, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't with us.
People here are tired of just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in these teams' games, and also non-Scots want to follow them.
Deila swears she'll turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is on alert for January's player moves.
Although Mark Warburton, the Rangers' boss, commented just a few weeks ago on possible targets for January players, he is on alert about the recruitment frenzy, asserting that he does not wish to confuse the crowd with unanimity.
Former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players who come in the summer, the adjustment period is the whole period ahead, as shown on our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu insinuates retirement
Swansea's attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years, and during the summer he failed to find new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League for Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost this 3-2. The defenseman's red card was revoked later, and this was already the third red card sentenced by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson remains behind his message, claiming that "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears he'll avoid Tynecastle.
A loyal Hibernia player was reprimanded for having admitted to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the derby at the Edinburgh Tynecatle stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a whim of the moment," said the assailant, adding, "it's probably safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the management team's ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape, "Donnelly says.
McInnes happy for "ugly win" in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory, which put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it be a trophy or a league that would not have won games in this way."
Unemployment in Scotland remains the same as the United Kingdom's whole number increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164 000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than that of the United Kingdom, as reported by the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
The Scottish Secretary of State, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations of a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over the past 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I testifying to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewer's gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists do, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and as there are often more applications than vacancies, participants will be selected through a terrible valuation.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever gets elected will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own contact with him through calls made over the months and one two and a half hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and pen with me to record what I saw.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a reporter from Oklahoma accused me of rigging about my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you can participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "could have set his words better," but he still feels that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
The reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to my series of podcast broadcasts.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Treese, his actions would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I believe there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I watch him die from.
I can't say I'm completely impartial.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police raid.
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured a man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police from his trail went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just a few feet away from a policeman who tried to "gently lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "proper police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The champion football player, Ben Cousins, is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the trustees tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's executives tried to infiltrate his stables last year and threatened to stop competing immediately.
He blames the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity division for claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tate due to the treatment on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has been put in a difficult situation following the inexplicable positive cobalt sample of Lidar.
He's been keeping his tongue down on spy allegations for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look "jealous."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything unravels at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to go on being a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what to do with my license.
In the past, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with Racing.com, where he told us that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, and I named him when I asked him, and offered him a job in my stables if he provided information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, then they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps to transfer responsibility to others other than coaches for what is happening in this sector?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I am saying may make them think about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has increased with a long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and the late rejection has led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, who is best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of day care "ridiculous" after the mud or saviaude has been put on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, "he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have had a haude last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
He had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition because of the day-to-day funeral treatment from which the trustees began their investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Convicted driver responsible for flight in Cobram
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of fleeing traffic after running into a cyclist this weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy of the Melbourne Storm team is attacking rivals in wrestling claims.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team's tackle would be part of the "alignment."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm's "wrestling" on their side when it suddenly won the final round in Sydney on Friday night.
The Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to cover up his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett called the game rugby league "window" and said that the two Queensland teams weren't "very excited" about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle and said they were just focusing on "contact" as they tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by the two leading coach's criticism of Storm, which means they're afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have only focused on contact with the tactical forces, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a bit of a shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coach, St George Illawarra Dragons, won the championship in 2010 by playing "boring."
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night's game with our Friday night's game and to tell how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St. George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought up that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play that way.
I get more confident when they say these things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a response to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more scoring than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting defense line to break and miss a goal?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in AAMI Park next Saturday night. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
For Serbia, $200,000 bail on a drug charge.
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for a $200,000 bail.
The 29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police tracked 100 kilos of drugs to Solay, which came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic threatens a possible life sentence for a business-to-business attempted possession of the intended amount of cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the whole amount and that he might have been in the café for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has fixed connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together had offered a bail of $200,000 to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the deposit of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But alone it wasn't enough to stop him from showing up for justice, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maximovic on condition that he handed over his passport to both Australia and Serbia, reporting to the police every day and maintaining his curfew between 6: 00 and 6: 00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send photos.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communications service where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of the children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, found the phone missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked at her phone and found some shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, looked at the computers on the site and found "worrying" web searches with search words used to search for obscene images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to attract paedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretended to be a cop to scare them."
Mr Robertson, the representative of the Fiscal Depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said that this is an addiction - he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said when he drank, he was sick of his head, and he wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, trembling and crying.
My mother saw immoral pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admits his guilt for making or taking pictures of obscene children on 14 June of last year. He broke his bail on 25 January of this year and failed to appear before the Court on 24 March of this year.
Defendant Gregor Sim requested that Hoggia should not be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it may be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element '.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to give the social services time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he's in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sexual offenders register before the day of the conviction.
Mr Mugabe gave the wrong speech to Parliament in Zimbabwe
The oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall spread like a virus in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' allegations that anonymous death threats had been sent to them warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed him and interrupted him with lashes when he gave the state speech to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is entitled" Death, "" Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and, when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The group leader said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned 'about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster growth in business equipment and services.
The expected job cuts will cost around $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP release.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the Chairman of HP and the Managing Director, who will manage the unit after the division.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a range and a deep range of services that will help companies to move to new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over $50 billion and will "focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" for companies, as explained in the company's press release.
The division breaks up a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University, in the 1930s, to produce electrical equipment. The company was operating in a garage in Palo Alto, known as "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the USA, and its distribution is the latest in a sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Captain Mikel Artta of Arsenal says team mates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb tie.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and, assuming that he is going as planned for his rehabilitation, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be taking part in next summer's European championship.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten his career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season, there is always a risk of further injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model forming.
The studies carried out by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons he has played Arsenal's 157 league games in just 65 games.
When looking at Arsenal's larger size since 2007-08, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Valioliga teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in disability statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you get back from injury, you can have a vulnerable period when you have to strengthen your body and gain competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will happen, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artta are likely to be starting.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give a breath to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear extension of section F, the largest stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of last season's Champions League against Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: Comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain and is three times more common among men than among women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved over 2,000 upper secondary school and upper secondary general school students showing signs of depression. The study showed that a person's chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his or her friends had a "healthy mind."
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style goes beyond the content and the immediate nature of the answer is often more important than the meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though in reality isolation rules.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - internal longing for personal growth and friendship - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not get greater happiness.
The beauty of the Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in nice chairs, watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of Samaritans explained to me:... "listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to provide longer-term survival options.
It highlighted the small moments of male friendship.
Although my neutral, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a nearby, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you participate in the Friends Fest at the Comedy Central this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends for coffee in Central Perk?
Or better yet, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are sent to the Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participating in # FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria is celebrating goals against Malmö with Blaise Matud and Edinburgh Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below are the match reports and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 victory against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in her debut for the French League Champions, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavan hit the goal by 61 minutes.
Paris, which is in block A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because there was not only a follow-up but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, because Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the Laurent Blanc team lost a spot in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in guests, so 2-0-win creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, although there are things we have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This is good news.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after he was injured in one of the three changes made after he left the team in a 2-2 tie in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named as the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran the Marco Verratt pass behind the Malmö defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and big profit from PSG, they'd be disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It won Celtic in a game of solution when it reached this level, its opening stage has nine international players and a five-man defense and two players deep in the middle field.
But on the offensive side, the only thing the team offered was Nikola Djurdjic's shot at 34 minutes, barely past Kevin Trapp's goal pole.
On the other hand, PSG sometimes got into trouble due to lost assists and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five companies only during the first half and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in at the beginning of the second half of Ibrahimovic's touch.
He was, however, much more effective in doing his pre-work for his colleagues, and it was precisely from Ibrahimovic's feed that Di Maria sent a spiral kick that tilted around the paint pole in Wilandi at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of game thanks to the raging of its sixth goal of the season, the Uruguayan Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had banged the Maxwell cross-feed from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only the brilliant battle of Wiland for David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the exchange of Ezra Lavezzi's goal was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmo's coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last game of the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
Mapping games aren't enough.
I'm going to raise the hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion in stock sales
In Switzerland, the mining sector was left by Glencore, who suffered from a fall in commodity prices, raised USD 2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in the notification that it had sold new shares worth around GBP 1.6 billion in order to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the collapse of commodity prices, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts pressure on demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The resubscription raised the value of Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning stores.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69 per cent higher.
In the previous week, Glencore had exposed a $2.5 billion share transaction as part of its wider plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by around a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 cents, which meant a reduction of 2.4% on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by around half, while at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
China's President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed by the White House's statement of Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President of the United States and the President's wife, Michelle Obama, will organise a dinner for Xi and her husband, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Preident Xi will allow the expansion of cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President Xi to discuss constructively issues of disagreement ', added.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of US technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber-espionage and its increased intransigence in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.
Matt Damon belittles the difference in making movies.
Matt Damon brought in an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, while they were discussing a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
At the HBO's Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown as he highlighted the need for different perspectives as regards the main character of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when selecting actors for the film, not for the show," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted unfaithfully to the injured, commenting on "Wow! Wow." While the actor of The Martian's comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," said Brown at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People's producer insisted on the rights of film directors Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon insolently replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation had been broadcast, the social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
The Twitter user, MrPooni, expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon, speaking on top of the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is in those whites that hurt."
After its publication, the tweeting gathered more than 5,000 new tweeting and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After a white cop killed a teenager, Michael Brown, in 2014, the Black Lives Matter spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the Albums of the Year nominees for the Grammy Prize.
"Album still matters," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published a statement to answer the question by Fox News's television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently told that Damon was part of it among entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
On Monday, Isaac Caldiero, a professional rock climber and vessel collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a prize of $1 million.
It was precisely the competition programme which ended its seventh term that had never had a competitor who could have survived all the sections of the obstacle path of the programme.
In the final episode of the show, two men, Caldiero and the cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
On the last mission, you had to climb a rope about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, which made her the first athlete of all time to discover the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, which made him a winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E! News after a difficult victory and was still in shock for winning a million-dollar prize.
"I mean, it's great to think about it when I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... so I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten is not getting more reward money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person in the world.
"If more people pass, the person who has the fastest time gets the money," Weed said.
Even though money is a great prize and changes life, he gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge against me.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period, whose shoot starts in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers crept past Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season hasn't been very funny for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central division.
Tigers played the full role of the Pirate on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get half a game away from Houston Astros in another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, for at least one evening, the game was a return to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach in most of the second half of the season.
"All the profits are fun, no matter how they are made," said Tigers' team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit made the run three times in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1 / 3 in the shift and released three runs.
This was only his third quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a replacement in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' surrogate, Victor Martinez, hit three times and allowed for two runs, which were his first run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Sensor Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right hand side, came home with one nest, and Simon was able to burn the second base player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was traded for a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player standing against him, first-time surrogate Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-nest run left of Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a smooth runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal shot leading to a double game.
It was the record of the main series: the 27th time this season when Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a backup run at the ninth start, Mauer pulled two battered runs against the Tigers' shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, a right-handed player burned the Word in three assists in his fifth rescue.
Detroit first took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two shifts against the right-handed veteran player who got off the list before the game after being away for over a month due to lower back infection.
"It is obvious that I did not want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a few nice assists in the third inning."
After Hughes picked up the starting batter on the first base, he let second base player Ian Kinsler move forward in one interval.
The right-wing walk of J.D. Martinez in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting shift, taking himself to the first base with a middle field bat and causing the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes while the runners were in good running positions.
The third-base player, Nick Castellanos, continued to hit right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he was trying to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second inning and got one fire, a two-nest catcher from James McCann and a two-fire, a one-nest run from Anthony Gose, followed by a 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said the team leader Paul Molitor of the Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew into the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the pass-through and entered the third inning without running, after which he was replaced by a right-handed continuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs for six shots and a walk for four fires.
NOTE: Angers' right-handed pitcher, Anibal Sanchez, was thrown out due to a sprain on the shoulder of the throwing arm.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August, due to shoulder tension, but he had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the list of injured to start against Twins.
The Norris statistics at Tigers are 1-1 in four starting points since the left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20, due to a right crooked abdominal sprain.
The Tiger and Twins three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, as President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to direct reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and to developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the Group leading the process of deepening public reform.
Support for transparency at a time when reforms are being pushed forward with more movement and vitality, and create a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list of restrictions on market access, a relaxation of the border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take over private capital, and a revision of the system of registration of residents.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created to identify the sectors and companies in which investment should not be made.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensure a legal business environment and make the market more transparent, as stated in the opinion.
The government also loosens its control over the power it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up state-controlled sectors to private investors, more sectors will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, "green cardie," will be facilitated by optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, in an opinion published after the meeting.
