Emeli Kouki led to the Hurricane's home victory at the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
The Hurricane-Loimaa, which was awarded the men's volleyball Championships seven times in a row, started the season 2018-19 with a home-run victory when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective in Hurricane by 22 points.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
It was pretty quick, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen's support for Kouk was 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
It's always important to win the opening game.
Many players also had experience from the other side, and it added extra to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the extension of the medallion is of course a goal, "Kouki said.
To determine Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was the most effective at 18 points in Savo Volley when the team took down Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially at the head of the attack, but luckily we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different downloads when I was playing against my former team, "Määtänen said.
Next to the volleyball in the 3-series period 2000-01 his career started by Antti Siltala scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuvinen was happy with a lot of things.
The hangar was small, the atmosphere was on the ceiling all the time.
I'm feeling good about the opening.
Miro was the king, Sill played a good game too, "said Tuvinen.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo while Tuovinen was head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Aka-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league point exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The picker scored 25 points when Aka-Volley took his season opening victory after he knocked down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for itself.
Today was a loss, of course, because we were in the fourth round of losing 17-21.
They dug up a round-trip win, and the fifth round came along at the same time, "Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most effective was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
The countryman, Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs, supported by 17 points.
Didn't get much of a grip on the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland the world's number one in comparison with human capital
Finland is the world leader in comparing human capital, "says Lancet, Science magazine.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed Finland.
Later the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst compared.
When measuring human capital, the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended as a goaltender
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois ventured into a great fight, and the local game of the Madridian teams ended in a goal-free tie late Saturday at the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
In the early part of the week, he was chosen by the International Football Federation, Fifa, as goalkeeper of the year.
In real terms, the best goal was awarded to Gareth Bale, but his shots were directed past the finish of the goal opening half.
Bale stayed in the exchange after the break because of a thighs injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned supporters of Real shouted at the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goal cannon that moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - A powerful documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected as President Donald Trump's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many would like to see Kavanaugh's decisive voice overturned the decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has come to pass over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Timo Soini (sin), Minister for Foreign Affairs, has made public efforts against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, Colleen McNicholas, a gynecologist, has become the only doctor performing abortions in the State of Missouri due to the tightening of the laws.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending the freedom of religion of the United States.
The news videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran church-men 'association led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons given by the pastor who has been interviewed are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States a year or so.
The legalization of abortions was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
As long ago as 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later on, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, that began to radically confuse religion with politics in order to get voters.
His abortion was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Senior.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document reaches the heart of the matter in seeking the basis for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When religious organisations in favour of segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought unusual nodes into politics.
In writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the President, who has bragged about the sual harassment, but who has captured the voices of the religious right on his abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused of sexual harassment by a number of women.
Mr Kavanaugh may have the power to rule on the rights of 164 million American women and girls, based on the status of the scales.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border with major demonstrations.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired at protestors in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, "says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12-year-old boys and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded from bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says they started using force so that protestors don't break down the fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12 000 wounded.
The demonstrators called for access to Palestinian families in areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's topper, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have knocked him down in the penalty zone.
The referee, Gavin Ward, let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think it was the divorce judge, Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in 85 minutes when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic knocked out a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the World Series of Championships.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in style in the chest muscle.
It was good for Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he went all the way to the end.
He created goals and defended them tirelessly.
For Norwich, the fight was fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - around 40,000 people in Finland experience interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in the protozoa age group.
In Finland this means around 40,000 people.
Up to now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The Serie E project, shared by the Crimean Service Support and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood started in Sexpo, which provides advice and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly, "Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
Many people are ashamed of their sexual preference for children.
Most of those who observe pedophile feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the ideas that are distressing and depressing them.
They also complicate normal life, says the General Sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, "says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the United States President's Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound a little strange, but Trump is one of the biggest winners of the prize based on the odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of the talks, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
On the basis of the odds, the biggest favorites for the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met this year three times and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The heat between the Koreas is considerable, as it was still good last year.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that rewarding Kim, who has spent years with nuclear weapons and who is leading his country with an iron grip, would also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday we will have the most attention paid to the peace prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege has worked to draw attention to sexual violence, which is a terrible byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been seen as a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued to refer to the North Korea negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which will decide on this award, has often recognised the people and organisations representing liberal democracy and multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding the Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire detection in the tunnel: The motorists behaved as if they were amicable and were driving in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja took place on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that there was a system failure, the fire department tried to get traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened, because there are drivers who are also in shock and they are driving however they please, the on-call fireman Pasi Kiräääinen told the STT that he was fresh at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even headed in the wrong direction only after a few moments of waiting.
When the first starts working against traffic rules, some others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Traffic Security Contact, is surprised.
According to the traffic rules, no stops on motorways and tunnels are allowed except for compelling reasons.
Road safety points out that, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go ahead and put traffic at risk with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always provide as accessible access as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reasons is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases of a driver stopping in a tunnel to brush snow from his car the other day.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, "says Heiskanen in the Traffic Security Bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake.
Ilves fans transported to Tampere by inland waterway boat M / S would have liked to stay on the boat to continue their victory party, although the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake by its bow, "says Juho Syrja, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M / S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and got caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one got hurt in the dress.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the boat until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and take the bus home, "said Syrja to the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the game of Ilves and HSK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the distance, the smell on Saturday was due to the water level of Vanajavesi being about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrki, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered by logs, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark bridge.
No more significant impact
Haveri took place in the western part of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had passed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the case, according to Syrää, as the speed of the ship at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom did not lead to a more significant impact.
According to the distance between the ship and the bottom, there has been no leakage or printing of the ship, and the cruises on the ship will continue normally with these views.
The diver stopped by Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship was towed from the shallow bank.
In order to be sure, we are still going to the yard to check that there was no damage, "says Syrja.
Syrja believes that the next M / S Tampere cruise, scheduled for next weekend, can be done as planned.
According to him, the cruise season will continue until the Fourth of July.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alert on Saturday night shortly after 1: 30.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call firefighter Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to darkness and quite intense wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service announced on Sunday night after half past three that everyone on board has been evacuated and the passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
A cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The nominee for Judge Trump, accused of harassment and drinking, may be out of the top position.
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been appointed judge of the United States Supreme Court, may well be out of his job, assessed by Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicion has put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up posing as someone else.
In the United States, it has occasionally occurred in the past that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court has caused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate has usually withdrawn himself, "says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain down on the floor of the democrats.
The Supreme Court of the United States is trying to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Mr Kavanaugh were to be appointed, the decision would probably rain on the floor of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming presidential elections.
It would increase the turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The appointment does not take place for every presidential term, as in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of around 70 to 80.
Some of the Republicans are hesitant about the name.
The candidates of the Supreme Court of the United States will be the subject of a regular background check, "says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a deadline of one week for further investigation by the FBI, Aaltola says that it can still bring up something relevant.
It might.
There is rarely smoke without fire, "says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inadequacy for office will be discussed vigorously before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be taken to the vote and the Republicans to lose.
A woman identified a Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the public broadcaster BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman told me from the photographs that this was a military intelligence unit working in GRU, Anatoly Tshepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia told us earlier that they exposed one of the men suspected of poisoning to the Czech Republic.
They said earlier that they found evidence that men's current identities are aliases.
The BBC group travelled to the village near the Russian-Chinese border in the Far East where the Czech Republic grew up.
A woman living in the village identified a young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the photos published.
He identified the same man from the photographs of the British police who appeared as the man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripali and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the title of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Earlier in September, during an interview with Russian TV, men suspected of poisoning reported being tourists in Salisbury.
Older people in throw-bags in the war reform
A living example has now been given of what the de facto limitation device for the reform of the war, as defined by the government of Sipilä, means.
The Valla Sote services of my municipality of birth are produced by the Oulunkaari joint municipal boards, whose health service manager was elected in 2016 as the former regional manager of Attendo.
The leaders of the municipal grouping are warning the council about the change-limiting device.
If the cost of war is now rising, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were spooked, and most of them are ready to undergo a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the institutional care of the Department of the Health Centre and to the small unit of persons with memory problems.
Home hospital care would be increased, which means long distances in Vaala that elderly people living in remote villages are ripped from their roots next to the health centre for "home" care.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay the customers.
The Left did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, close carers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with sote-provincial preparation slides how the municipality of Vaala is treating elderly people most at home at the moment in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Also included was Carina Western, the councillor of the neighbouring municipality.
The local paper did a big story about the event, and it put the Oulunkaari manufactures back on their feet.
The Sote Preachers do not write in any of the papers that Attendo has built a new caterer for the Valala, which is now waiting for the residents empty.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell us what level of care it will provide or what type of personnel structure Attendo will take to treat the elderly until hospice.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the medical centre will be closed down because there is no medical clinic at night.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the election shows how the officials of the centre run the councillors with incomplete information and the councillors are put back against the wall with a change-limiting device.
This is how the Central Party empties the population of Valta, for who stays there unprotected voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was it one of the constitutions in the city that the whole country was kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened a mosque of the largest in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered by the river Rhine since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of protestors, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected in advance to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
There were also supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the Grand mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the surrounding area for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and considered it to have strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel pledged to rebuild their relations, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounding the visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne and the Prime Minister of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening as the criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia has a significant proportion of the population of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three people are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been indicted for the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor reported that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in a murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February shot with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected that the murders were linked to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of the Karelian population on Sunday in sparsely populated areas.
Due to the error in printing, the Karjalainen of Sunday also has to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in the divided areas where distribution to common boxes is carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper and the problem may continue on Monday.
The mailroom puts extra bouquets into the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be sent separately until Monday with labels.
The distribution of these newspapers will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is today doing a live interview with Vesa Heilala, among other things.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip that she booked from the Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan to be paid.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year on year.
It now appears that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014 and the death of the victim, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or at the latest next year.
The number of the Vesa flight is 300, which means his trip is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and is in zero weight mode for 5 minutes at 100 km, a Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also has a history of longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw Star Trek on TV.
The wars of the stars have been seen, and that's what that thought was all about.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host.
Manchester City continued to make a loss-free run in Valioliga when it knocked down its home field on Saturday with Brighton's goal 2-0.
The sixth victory of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by paint sprays Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him in 30 minutes on the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own March to five when he sawed up the Brighton defense with Sterling in 65 minutes.
The Argentinean was able to place the 2-0 final on the penalty spot in an easy way.
With six wins and one draw, City started the season with 19 points to lead the Valioliga.
However, one less game played by Liverpool stalks only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool will meet Chelsea in his seventh round match.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Juvenile Society selected new decision-makers for its next three-year period for 2019-2021.
The president was Mr Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and vice-president Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The Board of Governors elected 40 full members and 40 alternates, the Finnish Youth Society will announce on Sunday.
A youth assembly meeting took place in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Young Society meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, "says the Finnish Juvenile Society in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the remainder of the season.
Hamilton runs the second Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points at the World Cup points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen will not continue in the stables next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the counter with gloves.
I don't think Kim will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that the Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming about Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sectionals.
From the pole point to the race starting at 2: 00, the Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes is going.
The evening paper follows the moment of the race.
The Championship of the A-Class of football became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players.
The top league of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 1: 00 tour of the championship, the starting points were clear: FC Lahti Academy is in the first place enough to score a score against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, the second in the championship battle, Ilves, must win the P.K.-35 and hope for the defeat of the Gulf.
In practice, however, the Lahti championship was confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less vase, the fight could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the game 16-0.
During the break, the Lahdes led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the horizontal players is that the team has played some of the same players in the A-youth SM series, the P20 series and the C-section of men's number two.
Vasa IFK has played practically against the fall of the season in Second.
On Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win in JBK's guest match and hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno. According to the rescue department, there was luck.
A passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on the roof on the Eno Juttuvaara Road on Sunday around 9: 00.
The accident involved four persons.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue services are reporting.
Good luck with that, it says in the press release.
The rescue department said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means of intelligence: Acquisition of equipment and recruitment already made, no mention of planned activities abroad
According to Antti Pelttar, Head of Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by means of equipment procurement and training of personnel.
When the intelligence laws came into force, the budget of the suo would be permanently increased by around EUR 10 million.
At the protective police premises in Ratakadu in Helsinki, full preparations are already being made for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the chief of the supo group, tells Western Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing topless campaigns to become aware of breast cancer.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shines again.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account where he only sings his hands in front of his breasts, explains the news agency AFP.
The song is the 1991 Australian The Divinyls hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I recorded The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to do regular self-check [breast]," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this placed me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do so because the subject affects all women, regardless of the colour of their skin, throughout the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays for many lives.
The Divinyls song co-author is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been done in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the comments from the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of Beijing's tennis tournament earlier this week.
There's a racket in the background at the American Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the head of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for much more extreme behaviour than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for tall people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves magnificent scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.

The valleys of the Korpela end today: This is how it all ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today it happens to the domestic rural drama of Korpela's alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third production season has gone as far as hot stones: last week, 722 000 Finns viewed television as their first performance.
The peaks are no longer of practical importance in themselves, as Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to be continued.
In the final episode of the relationship between Jaska and Mirku, we're going to take another big leap forward, and I think the first thing to guess is what's going to happen.
Anss and Miisa are warm, and in the light of recent events they are absolutely romantic, but then once again the skinny one appears in the picture.
Even the police have doubts about a sneaky man.
But no one has any idea what happened to Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear incredible news.
The last will of the long distance will be revealed, which will bring a woman to the edge of her tears.
In a week's time, Sunday evenings will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 9: 05 p.m.
Do you think tomorrow's a good time to go to work with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season is hot.
Many draw whether or not to stay home.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease may be contagious even if its own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping out.
In the latter option you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, "says Prevention.
So you think it's worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted one day before the symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough is down and the fever is no longer there, "says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to return to the gym will slow the recovery.
And don't forget to wash your hands, sniff your handkerchief, and throw the dirt papers in the trash.
I mean, in pain, though, right?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using a mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
That's when you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, "Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited with mask.
Then how can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina tells about Miss Finland's competition at the launch of semifinalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty of the lady found new friends, and the day went on to roll as hoped.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans ranks.
The SM-league after a career hockey player has played abroad, as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year apart, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and it would lead to a career for me, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about distance is that the initial spark will be kept up all the time, Alina grinnist in May.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The fight against Erkan Theper, the boxer Robert Helenius, is overshadowing the money dispute.
The evening-Messages announced today an application for challenge submitted by Boxing Manager Jaakko Helminen and Vice-Judge Jussi Kokkila for Helen's total outstanding management fees of over EUR 80,000 with interest on late payments.
According to the subpoena, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to settle, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, "says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanomi.
The current manager of Helenius Markus Sundman sent a response to the Evening Press explaining the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the sum required.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in a difficult financial situation and promised Helenius that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsorship for him.
It was literally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they provided.
This is also normal and the only practice in managing professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on paid work and that would also have been absurd in the case of Helen, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not have a draft until the end of 2014.
He said, for his part, that the proposal was poor and broke up cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never once fought with Kokkila and Helmine.
One year after the end of cooperation, Helenius had been shown to have "an unidentified but substantial" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same arguments have been put forward.
Helenius considers the post-cash operations of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, according to the reply.
Today, Helenius meets the IBF's heavyweight contender list in Stuttgart, Erkan Teper.

At the time he was a spokesperson for Finnleville and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always very knowledgeable, and I could see the fire he had on entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got directly into the skin of her interviewees.
He was a man of heart and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a respected radio host for Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was a good talker, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje in addition to journalism.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
But the biggest passion for the nut was the radio job where he had his own style.
He was a radio worker since the 1960s, and he became familiar with numerous listeners in the Aether of Yle.
He retired in 1998.

We believed in Erika all along, but half an hour before we got here, Svetlana was laughing.
Svetlana is Inkerian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, although she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that when Alina was little she was more interested in acting and many other things than miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty that she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty pageant.
The parents' wish was for Alina to go to college before attending the Miss Finland contest.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina still wanted to finish her Master's degree before the pageant.

Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a healthy example for young people and adults as well.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - thought of the idea of a comic book: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At the time, the organic poppa left my husband's speech, where he suggested it as a person for a story that I developed, "says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been having a great time as a housewife.
It's been the best time of my life, but at some point, I thought, "What would you do when you were growing up when even the smallest child started to be big?"
And then, in 2014, a comic book came in.
Piippo tells me that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a kid.
I had not drawn since I was a child, but when these manuscripts of organic dandruff began to emerge, the situation changed.
At first, I made some dozens of manuscripts in the desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skillful artist, but I couldn't persuade her to join us until summer 2016 when I bribed Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strippers, and then it was forced to start trying, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, "says Piippo about his relationship with the drawing he usually does at night.
I mean, the scripts are constantly popping into my mind, but usually I don't do it all at once.
One of the three-square strippers will take up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd be happy to play with the colors.
It's always hard to start drawing because drawing isn't my strong suit.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the contemporary comics of newspapers including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The character of the organic puff is a carrot-body mother with a salad bush.
Other people are Man, Pissis and the Twins.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a straitjacket, even though it is sometimes the nature of the matter.
Piippo says he reads his show with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at a comic book you drew and you say this is what I've done today.
And there's a lot of challenges for a housewife!

The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said in Mr Yle's first claim that, although the tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports from Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn felt that Europe was still very much at stake.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan as well.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding to the brink of a trade war.
You have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in Yle's interview.
Europe also carries its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
Yesterday, on Thursday evening, the Italian Government reacted violently to a clearly deficit budget.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the loan stock in the country is problematic loans and more than ten per cent unstructured loans.
Moreover, its public finances are at a low level and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
It might not be worth painting new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in peace.
The difference would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, will withdraw from office in just over a year 's time.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn's and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name has flashed in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on this further.
HS's super popular Black Box shows will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
The other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23rd The Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets sell Flag.
Journalists and photographers on stage during the evening tell a long-prepared true story that has not previously been published in any of the HS instruments.
There's something going on again that I'm sure no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the world and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet with the suppliers and photographers of the HS and to continue the discussion.
The Helsingin Sanomat has organized the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They've been popular from the start and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already been to the bleachers.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the willingness of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring season 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The content of the proposal that will be presented at that time will be different from that of the evening of this autumn.
The missing fungus was discovered by an "unprejudiced experiment."
The Finnish police have the best drone skills in the world: "We are being asked about training"
According to the principal of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone not only for missing persons but also for crime scene investigations and intelligence purposes.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the Mushman who disappeared in Raahe with Drone in just a few minutes.
Principal Kimmo Himberg of the College of Police Studies referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are the world leader here too."
Drone is a rather new thing and even newer on police duty.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of the drone use.
Mr Himberg said that there was a strong impression that this was the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, "says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the drone action of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
Expanding
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in the Raahe case, the lost person was found using a drone in only a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're going to train more of them.
The drone is already heavily used in police work, and its use will increase and increase in the future.
This is what I would dare to say, "Himberg says."
In addition to the search for missing persons, Himberg says that the police can use drones for, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence work.
For example, we need to go a little further to check a region where there may be fears of violence.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby rose to first divar
Karelian Rugby celebrated a 2-division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuu were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and covered the guests from the south 26-12.
The 2-division championship also knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby in the 1-division.
The club has played in first place before, but at that time the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM-series and several blocks of 1 division.
The club is going to take the show, but it's going to be a hell of a job next winter.
The present roster of less than twenty players must be brought up to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so funding must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi to start season in Montreal, confirms head coach
The hockey player Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien confirmed the club's Twitter account that Finnish invader Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise from Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round of the number three summer reservation.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has presented strong excerpts at the September training matches.
Kotkaniemi was able to score the goal in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish citizen for taking major developments after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts next week's night against Thursday in Finnish time.
Montreal faces Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
A lot has been said about leadership in Finland this week.
In an interview with the HS, the Chairman of the Nokia Board, Risto Siilasmaa, explained his book Paranoid optimist, in which he shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia studies have also mentioned the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and silence, which in part led to the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising risk-taking capacity and agility disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, the Nordic Business Forum also held a big business event, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to the star Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world were added to the stage.
There was enough talk of good leadership.
Leadership legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader should dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the "Whole Foods" chain, known for its wide range of organic products, said that the director must be able to communicate with the entire staff about the company's purpose.
And that purpose can't just be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the Introverts of the Book of Succession, told me that the most successful leaders are researched to be humbled.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Professor Aswatch Damodaran pointed out that the qualities of a good leader should coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown into maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of an information blob.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That's why management is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They were talking to each other in front of each other in a comrade manner.
However, it is unlikely that they will wonder whether Nokia was the right leader at the right time.
And it wasn't easy to judge their humility from an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived on the red carpet in Los Angeles... and spent most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the mission finals in a gorgeous black dress.
Miss Finland in 2012 also had a lace lacquer in her impressive dress.
A little jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
For the longest time, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me how he belongs.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A. for an audition.
Among other things, he's been doing commercial descriptions.
Working in the United States he describes as interesting and also similar to Finland.
However, he said that work had to be done even harder, as there was always a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, "says Chafak.
Choreographer for Sonya Lindfors 30 000 euro live art prize in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30 000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
The winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors, is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments which they have previously intervened in, the panel described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating on the live art field.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for in the major operation: "We can't tell you where."
The large-scale search of the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges between the Öresund and the Great Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Skälland was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the head of shift at the Copenhagen police media centre.
They found the car they were looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police briefing will tell Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the black Volvo we're looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Ekstra Bladet from Denmark told us about the police briefing on Saturday.
Chief Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was involved in a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime title to be used to investigate the case.
But Skov told me it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been apprehended.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events in their Twitter account.
According to the STT, however, the public at large no longer has cause for concern, as certain people were at risk.
Macedonian name has caused decades of dissension - now the people will vote in a controversial election
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new country's name.
According to the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by adopting an agreement.
The vote began sluggishly at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital city.
The retired nurse, Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, called for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, an independent Macedonia has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the turnout will rise above the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to change the Constitution.
The agreement must also be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at eight o'clock in the evening in Finnish time.
That's a great win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper.
late Saturday night, Robert Helenius met Erkan Temper at a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.

Tepper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper first encountered in the ring.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when he appealed to injury and withdrew from the fight.
After that, it became clear that the German had been burned twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who has gone to the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
With Hamilton's stable order to win, the difference is already 50 points for Vettel.
The Formula One championship title was approaching again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian gp and stretched his World Cup lead to the Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five more races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position for the race, took second place.
Last year in Sochi, the winner of his career, Bottas held a leading position in the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let him pass Hamilton.
Vettel was the third driver, Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari.
The Max Verstapen of the Red Bull, who started from the last line of departure, was fifth.
The two of them were beaten up by a jute man in Joensuu. They were caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old jute man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6: 00.
According to the police, the men also hijacked the victim's phone.
The police were able to reach the suspects, a 35-year-old male in July, and a 39-year-old man in Iomantsi, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were apprehended as a suspect in a robbery, the police will tell you.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, leaves his post as Chairman of the company's Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets, which would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement with the United States of America on Naphtha.
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Naphta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday and their negotiators have been talking closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Chrystia Freeland, postponed his intervention at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico wish to bring this agreement into force before the successful Mexican presidential election, Mr Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.

The situation led to pushing and fistfights between team supporters.
It took, among other things, the cavalry to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the airport, there was rampage in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the catches also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation, and Mr Värtinen referred to the rampage on the ground.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
The table stone caught a butterfly in its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have reached the finals on the final day of the World Cup 3 / 7 in Holland.
They're swimming on a short track in Eindhoven.
The HSS's Table Stone startled Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly, where he was at the second time of the first series of 22,82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo Cetus, was on the 24th period of the butterfly.
Swing Club Vuokat Laukkanen was in the early stages of a 50-metre breast in the sixth period of 30.48 and moved to the final.
In the early stages of two hundred metres of mixing Laukkanen was on the 15th period of 2.14.25.
The students are playing a rare delicacy: an ancient tragedy - a reduced Orestes affects its visual nature.
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on the Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last witnessed an ancient tragedy, the Sofokleen Filoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theater University brought the only ever-preserved play trilogy of Aischylus Oresteia to the tour starting at the National Theatre.
In the Lavat Open! projects started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre University work with the professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia's international premiere was held in Berlin in April.
The atonement of Roiha from Oresteia summarises the report on the end of the blood feud of the condemned House of Atreus and on the birth of the rule of law for one hour to twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the chorus sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simononen's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the display of the theatre site highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
Its centre is alternately the dynamics between those who break out of the choir, who play the role of name, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple statements of name roles.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the war in Troy and his war hall, Kassandra, are shown on the stage, contrary to the tradition of the ancient performance scheme.
Of course, the performance does not point out that it is loyal to the antiquity of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation is created in front of the viewer's eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a strong group of acting students in the Master's degree stage, even as a single organism.
Especially in choir sections, actors who are flexible in their ability to bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations will be able to gain their rights on the bare stage, only by decorating the white curtain.
Impressive.
The Oresteia show tour continues at the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new situation is beginning to emerge in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will provide a model for the renewal of one thousand cars for the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell truck on the market, Hyundai continues on the Nexon and ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell road as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, "Hyundai Motor Vice President in Cheol Lee said at the launch ceremony.
There were many fists in Kajaani.
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and outside it on Saturday morning.
He first hit a man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the country, and in the absence of a third man, the assailant struck him as well.
The police picked up the assailant.
At the police station, he still acted aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and murder.
They put him in jail to calm him down.
The case is being investigated in the form of three assaults and violent resisting of an official.
There was also another assault case in the middle of Kajaani Street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajani male, about 20 years old, hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him before kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and a police officer called in.
But the perpetrators already left before the police arrived.
The police will ask witnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to inquisition.kainuu @ police.fi.
The long-line radio host Erkki Nulli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Dull, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is it. This is it.
The doctor said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the Evening Press a month ago.
We need to guarantee the safety of the store's aunts and uncles.
First time I got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
With these annual rings, when a topic amazes you, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was astonished and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Käähää, the working environment expert of the Association of Services Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers are, of course, saying otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly perceived as serious, and many real violent situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to statistics their near miss status under the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
In the event of violence, there has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, mental trauma can be much more severe than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threats have to be counted as violence - even if there is no recourse.
Too many people are afraid at work, even if the actual thing doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
As the opening hours of shops were released, the media had a fairly high impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, quite a few employers provided security services for hours at least during the night and to prevent working alone," Kohähää commented.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the security situation remained well under control, the impression arose that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been abused does not wish to make an inquiry into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same law of 2011, minor assault becomes the prosecution's responsibility if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle of the store is abused, the police should investigate and prosecute.
When the court put a few assailants in prison, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open even in small places almost night and day must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for the mission before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss' crowning is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host of Backstage and the red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Prior to the live broadcast, the host trio informed the guests and media representatives who arrived on the scene of the broadcast.
At first Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a big round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg glowing with his colleague's audience cheering.
The front row is followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, for example, sat next to each other and Sohlberg made a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg was looking at Saro.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though at first he seemed confused.
Sippi spoke for the first time in the evening-Sanomie's weekend paper.
The mischievous lady told me she didn't want to open the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because that's between her and Scrooge Salmine.
He said he's not in a hurry to have a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Siepp told me.
The marriage award for Harjula came up at a later stage when Sohlberg inadvertently made the mistake of calling Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio laughed at a screw-up.
Iiro was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi signed for the screw-up.
The northern man tortured his tied partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce.
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for a number of crimes committed against his cohabiting partner for three years in prison.
The instrument used to commit a crime was, among other things, a belt, cable and zip ties.
The court ruled that the goods in question were lost to the State.
Ranki's indictment was about a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two damages were attributed to the Kokkolainen.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May last.
At the end of the last act, a man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape.
The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivation of liberty and of aggravated rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed as inadmissible by the court.
The case was handled in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public account of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the defendant had been subjected to violence, intimidation and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his offering with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed strong sauce, poured water and coffee on it.
By judgment, the court ordered the state to lose the instruments of crime: belt and cable, zip ties, robe belt, knife and locomotive.
Four witnesses.
According to the district court, the two sides continued to live together between their actions.
It can be seen from the sentence that a large proportion of the most serious acts took place at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
It is unlikely that he will have the money in question, because the sentenced person already has debts to collect.
The prison sentence isn't the first one in a man's life.
The tabloid doesn't give the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district court sentence is not legally valid when you write this.
Europe leading four points to the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their leadership in a traditional game of holes against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup near Paris with points 10-6, while the twelve doubles are still in front of us on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four football matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon the profits were leveled 2-2.
Europe was led by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached that.
On Sunday, the two of us will be looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cup, and even the Americans have not won like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not a football game"
On Sunday, the football league team HJK published an announcement condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at the FC Honka game in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters stormed the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with the Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
They didn't calm the situation down. They needed police officers and also cavalry.
HJK tells us in his press release that the team players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The post-match events are not in line with our traditional 111-year-old society.
"We are abruptly dismissing from any activity that endangers the safety of the fighting events," says the press release.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to identify security threats and to eliminate mild phenomena.
A pro culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," the press release says.
A Filipino inventor flies in a drone car to avoid traffic jams.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of clown fearless.
He is now part of a growing group around the world who swears to have invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man spent a great deal of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he claims to have made his first successful test flight - he flew his device at an altitude of over seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will trigger positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Tomorrow's industrial action will be visible in child day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, tomorrow's overwork and shift bans will be particularly visible in social services, health services and day care for children, assessed by JHL's Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in a way that does not have enough staff present.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, "says Niemi-Laine to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift trading due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to hire staff but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not a labour battle yet.
In terms of health and safety, it is a standard for every worker to have regular working hours and only to do so.
JHL is opposed to the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader of local government employers, does not undertake a prior assessment of the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so vast, the social and health sector and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer, "Julonen said to the STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week experience was already gained from similar activities of the local and basic carers' association Super and the Social and Health Care Trade Union Tehy, for example, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather minor.
The JHL's ban on overtime and shift exchanges applies, inter alia, to employees in municipalities, churches, the state and private social and health care.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100 000 JHL members are involved in the labour battle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the law on dismissal continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that this is where we run to the wall and hard.
Mr Jalonen believes that both the AU movement and the government must meet.
The thing about this is that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the show hasn't been delivered yet, Jalonen is updating.
The Great Coral Reef is born by children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show we study skates and sea horse gestures
The Great Coral Reef of the collective in other locations was first premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, there will also be a clearer proposal, which will refresh and crystallize the findings of the initial exercises.
There is also a lot of fairy-tale magic in theatre games for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is not a children's show, but a performance that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves at exercises and common games also helps to distance adults from children.
The Great Coral Reef is therefore somewhat like a fairytale ballet, a fitness circle and a natural awareness attack, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human environments.
The great coral reef begins with familiarising itself with coral and coral reef organisms and fish.
In six different environments, you can learn the gestures of skates and sea horses, for example.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour, with music, lights and shiny paints and costumes, will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being examined.
In addition, there are coral-looking organisms.
Eyes and observations in many directions make the performance dense and life-wrenching.
Whether you're the landscape of some kind of organism, whether you're the view of the landscape, or whether you're the other organism or the view of the organism, and all of this at the same time.
For kids, it doesn't seem like a hard thing to do.
In other areas, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action where the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held on behalf of the endangered corals in Sitrator.
Damage beyond human understanding should not be allowed to be hardened, although it could be difficult to understand the significance of self-indulgence in the face of the visions of destruction.
In other places, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of them, for which it will make space clear.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming even more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives because of drugs and sex, because other people say they do.
I was overwhelmed when a friend of mine told me he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister over the weekend from "boyfriend."
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences from that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs can't be touched and sex is a grown-up thing.
I wish modern children could live a proper childhood, and they wouldn't have to grow up too early because of group pressure from friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup and reveal their clothes on their faces.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing images.
It's even harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones when I was a kid.
I got to be a kid for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people would think of me.
Yle: Authorities informed the state administration that the case of Airisto Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protective police and the armed forces visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation into Helmi by Airisto is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, "Yle reported.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
Mr Kanerva said that this week the defence forces and the protection police visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs to report on an ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were rather strict that they did not speculate that there was anything else here, Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to the information available, no evidence of a link to national security has so far been found in the seized material, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way of knowing what might be revealed there yet, one of Yle's interviewees says.
A week ago, large-scale searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a purely economic crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
Earlier this week, the evening paper put together a case that is going through arguments both for and against.
Video: The dream goal saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100% start of the League came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 tie on the Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combination sent a signal to the entire Valioliga that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure the manager of Liverpool, Jørgen Klopp, came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started more strongly, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be controlling his own field end alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great guest victory for the league cup from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a magnificent performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was there from the very beginning.
At 25 minutes, he was first in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted punch.
Hazard went a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but bombed a perfect left foot in the back of the bottom corner of the bet.
Pool's Brass Watcher Alisson was a little slow in his rejection and couldn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned up Mo Salah's control from the finish line.
During the second period, Chelsea Vesper Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to the bet of the Sadio Mané and pushed the ball from the base of the pole to a corner kick.
On the other end, Alisson made a zero with his throwing his way through Hazard.
The best place for guests came in at 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the bush of the Brass Star was headed towards the national team mate David Luiz, who saved the host's leading position.
Even that didn't last for 89 minutes, when the changeling Daniel Sturridge got a free shot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it at the top of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 tie, but it's still at the top of the league with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship fight with two points behind the tip.
In the clock shift conversation, the foxholes are deep.
I remember a few decades ago a newspaper asked different Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in mind: The Nen terminal.
Some have a non-terminal surname and some have no.
I mean, you could be born anywhere, and this is one of the caterers.
Finland has brought about the abolition of annual clock movements in the EU.
There are very many people who agree that the clock shift twice a year has been the work of fools and caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of a solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to find out what time it will finally be: the present summer or winter or some other time zone.
This also gives people an opportunity to express their views on the offantaa.fi page.
The inquiry has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is being heated at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say to say.
Wintertime defensemen justify their position with the influence of the morning light on people's well-being and summer time with the influence of the evening light on people's outdoor desire and hence well-being.
Both have strong supporters and good arguments.
Research suggests that the morning light is the rhythm of man's day and gives him a refresh.
On the other hand, if not particularly affected by waking up in the dark, brightness increases the movement of people outside and provides better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The number of additional lights after a normal working day has already been calculated for one hour.
I'd rather have both, but the bad news is that our position in the north corner of the planet is beyond us.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
The typical feature of this debate is that one is driven by one's own view and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other party are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion, it is rather pointless to try to turn one's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is awfully easy for debate, because it does not require great effort and a muddy feeling is sufficient to justify it.
In general, similar issues are the subject of the most radical and equally ineffectual disputes.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we can adapt to that.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close guest victory.
Josba's first guest game in Divari was a total of three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the finish line at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In the time of 50.47 brothers Eutu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
When both teams froze, they played decisive minutes with a flat.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
The second chain was also fiery when Teemu Cinderella (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonkin (1 + 0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
Next up comes O2-Jyväskylä guests in two weeks.
My uncle's church on Sunday. It's his 200th birthday.
The 200-year anniversary of Uncle's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the arson of the Church of Aspiration was a shock.
Even Uncle's church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a place for a party tonight.
Even if no one would want to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church in Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite the municipal and other associations of all the world.
The family show starts at Uncle's church at 10: 00 this afternoon.
After that, we move to the parish house by the Karelian banquet table.
There's a lot of stuff going on in and out all day.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of the retired Ari Räsänen, who has served 37 years as a parish champion.
The church's birthday also means the end of an era.
The church house, already deactivated, built in 1982, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in evasive rooms at the former town hall, "says the chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk will step down from the chair of Tesla's board of directors... the fraud charges were settled for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have agreed their case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by the company that he set up.
But Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk is forced to resign from the seat of the Chairman of the Tesla Board for a period of three years.
The company will have to hire an outside board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
The agreement requires Teslan to hire two independent directors and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk are both paying USD 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disturbances and disadvantages for Tesla's shareholders," says Director Steven Piekin of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC thought Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that they would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said that it called for Musk to be fined and that he should be banned from running listed companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went down sharply.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency, according to the AFP.
The number of deaths is expected to increase further, as the damage is still being resolved.
Vice President Yusuf Kalla says the final figure may rise to thousands.
The earthquake on Friday raised a tsunami that sank into the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
After the earthquake, a warning was issued about Tsunami, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, the Palau.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Call for help from ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Koki Widodon, who arrived in the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue operations day and night.
One of the centres of the rescue is the Palu hotel, which is still believed to have between 50 and 60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, reported that one person was dug alive in the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was favoured by business tourists.
We also heard people asking for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy grubbing-up equipment would be urgently needed in the earthquake and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesian people have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family is still missing, and one of the writers called in a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The interferees were able to access, among other things, the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to profiles by using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
Login to the profile allowed you to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change the profile image of Boris Johnson for a moment to a porno photo and a title to insult.
Michael Goven's profile image was changed to the image of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian Columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can look at the profile person's contact information and send messages in his name.
The meeting application made the telephone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticised.
The Conservative party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority ICO supported the data leak.
The application was made by an Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted with security issues.
Every week there are a large number of Polish clappers in the public of The Wall Finland.
Close-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The Wall, the fast-growing American format of the world, landed in Finland last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as a large 12-metre high gaming wall in the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, social media highlighted the studio audience of the programme, which was betting on being Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game that is being played in Finnish.
The head of the 4th National Program, Unne Ring, will shed light on the issue in the Evening Press.
He tells us that the studio audience includes players close to Finland, other Finns living in Poland, and only Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
Even in Finland, there are such people, so-called professional audiences, who take pictures of different programs, "Fingerprint explains.
He points out that following the game in itself is not so hard to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls that fall off the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
For foreign-language speakers, however, there are interpreters present who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret as simultaneous interpreting to a studio director at all times.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, "says the Ring.
He compares the situation with the way in which David Hasselhoff was recently engaged in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a member of Talent Finland a few years ago in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation of the ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the shoot, the sum of the Ring.
South of Japan, the sullen typhoon is moving towards the main islands - the authorities are warning against landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuni Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and so far there are no reports of fatalities.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated from shelters and electricity has been cut off from over 300,000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in some places stalled due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rain.
Train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to the weathermen, Trami will be tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of the aces grew gloomy
It's been a bad early season for the aces.
The sky was almost darkened when the team lost on Saturday on its home field to Vaasa Sport with a reading of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, and the total score for six rounds is two.
No Aces defenseman or two lower-chain players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
Sportti was out of the hall when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that's what we played so poorly.
In particular, the performance of the second round was disgraceful, "Jarno Kärki said.
The sport naturally enjoyed a victory.
The team had a game below Friday night, so it would have been visible in the making.
Maybe it was, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors on the day of bread continued to increase
The mother of bread day Pirkko Hyörisinen wonders about the audience of the event in the stands of the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe this year not so many people would come, "Goodness will think in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Clock SM-contests were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it did happen; the corridors were clogged up before 10: 00, the sellers said that the products were out, that more news oatmeal was sold for nearly 500 doses and that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, "says Mr Hörisinen later this afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon included a particularly large amount of programme for families with children, which seems to attract a record number of them.
In addition, it is estimated that the event will reach even further away.
The sellers also turn to Liper each year from a larger area.
This year, the rapporteurs, the vendors of crafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived at the baker's office by almost a hundred.
Mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hörisinen, was admiring the audience in the stands.
At the beginning of the bread day, the crop was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread contest.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in a marto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful luminaire - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
Good lighting is worth a lot of money.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do me a favor. Do me a favor.
The more age years are behind, the greater the importance of lighting.
Sufficient light can be used to help many with problems that arise with age as the visual acuity decreases and dazzles are increasingly affected.
Older people also need more light.
A guy in his 60s needs light three times more than a guy in his 20s.
It is therefore worth investing in the therapeutic effects and properties of light for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
Now, the decorator can afford a choice.
The popular style is the Japanese style, which combines Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrostyle, inspired by the 1970s, with strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has risen to boom.
The same fascination of authenticity as the rest of home decor.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Extend your personality.
On the other hand, more emphasis is being placed on home than in the past, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very forward-thinking, "says Jokiniemi.
It may not be the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewel-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, "says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and good-bye!
Kookoo showed the door to the Canadian invader after three games.
Cooko and attacker Brendan O'Donnell are getting separated.
The Canadian invader played three league games in orange black without power points, "Kookoo explains in his release.
Mr O'Donnell moved to Kookoo in August with an annual contract including a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old assailant played in KHL in the Kundund Red Star ranks and in the KHL farm in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no word yet on O'Donnell's new company.
The gambler wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
In addition to the games, the game specialist is currently recycling packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stone foot shop are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online shops are packed, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come for us go to reuse.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is fit to be used, "says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Game Man.
As soft material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
The bubble plastic will be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving on to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra burden.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is naturally suited to the game man's activities, as among the new products, the main product range of the shop includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion know-how: One shirt and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from one season to the next in a costume like a costume.
They create the foundation of a good garderobi with their multifunctionality, as it is easy to put together different types of costumes around high quality classics at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the best classics used in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with polo collars cannot have a defect.
The garment can be connected to straight pants, tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a gloomy style around it.
Pooloneule is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classic sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend loom is born of golden brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, black polo needles and gray ankles.
The classic polo needle together with other classics, the blue-green Scottish rose skirt and wine-red loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black polo needle by combining it with the trendy pieces of clothing: denim, high boots and thick stockings.
Young and classy!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or GRU Military Intelligence (GRU) have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet period, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvetyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence team.
The representatives of the KGB in the western countries of the Soviet security service have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, "says Vasili Mitroh, the archivist who defected to the west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the DRG groups for the cover operations of Bundeswehr, the railways, game keepers and road workers.

The true story on TV today: the climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie was made on the basis of them.
Everest will now have its premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised the climbers on Mount Everest.
The control of Baltasar Kormákur in 2015 is about survival fighting, which has been dealt with in great detail.
Tragedy has been made into movies and documentaries... before.
The facts are also being examined in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide to the Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye operation performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, which is why the invasion of the summit had to be ruled out.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm went up, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
It's like a miracle he got back on his feet and found the others.
The worst frozen Weathers were still thought to be dying and once again left to their own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the co-climbers began to believe in the possibility that they were given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers plays Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Kaira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today has been a celebration of the 200-year-old Church of Uncle.
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and in honour of the anniversary the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at the Eno church hill at 10: 00 at the family fair, after which a Karelian table has been served at the Eno parish house.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
My uncle's vicar, Armi Iravuori, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, "says Ironvuori (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Acceleration, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno's church.
The Church of Eno is now Joensuu's oldest church in Evangelislutheran churches after the fire destroyed the church of Acceleration.
The wooden church of Acceleration Vaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, there was a worship in the heat of the fire, which was silenced and remembered the church that was destroyed in the fire.
Images and videos: The media flashed its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm came on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, the media, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyclades and Crete.
The images taken from the area show a great deal of flooding throughout Greece.
The video released on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared in the city of Kiato in the Korinthia area instead of in the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been driven by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, a strong wind caused strong seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens advises people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, the media, brings with it heavy rain and even flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medians occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left a trail of floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerned about Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
Also in the summer, areas destroyed by mountain fires around Athens will be hit by the storm.
My media in Greece was also rampant last November.
We should not go to the sea at the moment, but the flights are on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm.
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
The guides have distributed such instructions to a good 3 500 Finns on holiday in Greece during the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, because even the storm Zorbas, which is rising to horrendous levels, is predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete wind speed can rise to up to 45 metres per second.
It's the heavy rain that makes the weather worse.
According to the tour operators, all passengers travelling via Suntours and Tui to Greece from Finland who have given their telephone number have been warned about the strong winds via SMS.
But the sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communication, by Saturday early in the evening, holiday resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Sure, we'll keep an eye on the situation all the time.
Security ahead of us.
I supported the media officer Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our personnel at the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me Saturday night.
In the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, there are currently around 1,500 Finnish passengers in total.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kosi should reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had made a mockery of the sun and the temperature went up to 27 degrees Celsius, "says Ikonen of Suntrips.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit somewhat relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, "says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvis and Janni Huss have identical evening dresses in the mission finals - this is how they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland finals on Saturday in an evening dress.
Hussi tells me he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store, and I decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by the host Shirley Karvinen.
The twin himself also noticed the same outfit and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomi he was busy preparing, and he had to put himself on a plane.
Hussi is the backstage and red carpet host of the mission finale, and he's talking to the front-row stars who show up.
Hussi's got a fresh move in the back because he moved from Kampi to Jättäsaari on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi wondered.
Before he moved, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, "Hussi says.
Shirley Karvinen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention... gathering curious views from pensioners.
The host and Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen in 2016 told Miss Finland that she had had enough to do with the radio plans and Love Island Finland shots.
There has been enough rush to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from the Finnair flight.
I made up my hair and put it on the plane.
This is the glamour.
The evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled out his makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of the fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking at me in the mirror.
At least everyone thought it was funny to put on my makeup.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen tells that he enjoyed his job as a host to Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as a stoppage so far.
Karvinen says he came by Friday to say hi to the singles on the show.
In some ways, it's really raw.
They're people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How do I put on my knee boots?
Three perfect models.
Classic clothes are clothing pieces that work from one season to the next in a costume like a costume.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the high-knee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not left anywhere.
According to its name, the boots above the knee are repetitive from year to year and from season to season.
The showy boots share user opinions, but the bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
For the overknee boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's denim, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or artificial leather of the boots is working.
Long boots look good both in the party booth and in everyday clothes.
Black high-knee boots are very suitable even for gentle outfits.
They are suitable for balancing the femininity of a pink, flowerful plisher skirt and a soft, puffy sweater.
A fresh, but elegant everyday costume for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet dress, knee boots, impressive earrings and a stapler bag.
Although the upper knee boots have a certain refinement, they also fit perfectly in a relaxed everyday style together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Lovely and easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo.
They operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, "says the City of Espoo.
Otaniemi's robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring it is planned to start traffic by a robot bus.
The project develops and pilot the operation of robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of the vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how the robot cars are doing on the current street net.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, "says Johanna Nyberg, Head of Traffic Management.
For the first time, robot cars travel completely automatically among other transport modes without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their environment with several different sensors and assessing whether there is a freeway.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director for Robot Transport Development.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn on three days a week: on Tuesdays from 1 to 3: 30, on Wednesdays from 10: 00 to 3: 00 and on Thursdays from 10: 00 to 3: 00.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops can be identified by stop markings.
The most secure way to get aboard is from the Otakaari stop number 1.

Police oversaw hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finland Police Department carried out forest monitoring with Metsähallitus and the Finnish game centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's interlocutors reported in social media on Saturday.
The focus of surveillance was on the legality and legitimacy of the hunt.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons were checked as well as the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in canning.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 per day for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown by the police and two of them are suspected of DUI.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, the police once.
To sum up, hunters are very good at complying with hunting authorisation.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter said, "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
In the autumn, the police department of Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting with other supervisory authorities.
Mökkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
The Minister for the Interior, Kai Mykkänen, will be travelling to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps into Finland this year.
Selection visits are usually carried out a couple of times a year and include representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee organisation UNHCR will first nominate particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group that comes to Finland than there is in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
Mr Mökkänen also meets non-governmental organisations from the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, on the border with Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has taken on quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has last fallen into the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people a year.
The visit by Mr Mökkänen will be the first to be made by the Minister for the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees in this government.
The previous Home Affairs Ministers Petteri Orpo (co) and Paula Risikko (co) moved on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to get lost - we don't know if we're gonna cry or laugh
Last Saturday, a Karelian reporter reported a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
This article gave the impression that the draft law in principle prohibits the keeping of all animals which are not specifically authorised by ministerial regulations in relation to production animals, pets or other business activities.
So everything else is, in principle, prohibited except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being a law, then that means that in Western democracies we are rejecting the general principle that the law explicitly prohibits activities that jeopardise the safety or good practice of society.
In principle, we are now introducing a ban on any activity which is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
This change means that nothing new can be tried, for example in business, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
In general, the government's activities in the preparation of the law have been weak.
If we now go down the road that in Finland, in principle, everything is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But this is not the kind of legal project that is part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder whether it will accept this' everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation '.
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will stop such a legislative project.

Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason for Mercedes's superiority over Ferrari
The Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp's in time.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, as an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time for the weekend so far, but they were just too fast, the fourth driver and their teammate Sebastian Vettel, clearly left behind from Mercedes speed, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari had a hard time at the last race in Singapore.
The question was asked to the raggedy what the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride is all about.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew why, I guess we'd go at the same speed they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is all speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare delicacy was seen in time for the Sauber of Räikkönen's future stable.
Next season, Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen in Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the last time session.
For Swedes, the tenth place is the best place to start in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkö for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early days, it's been a big step forward.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper, "Robbe is back."
The match between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper at Stuttgart's evening progressed steadily.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
Helenius, far more far-reaching, controls the fight with his hard-core series, which found its way to the end.
The Finnish was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Tepper on his left.
The hit was so hard, the fighter who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius was very moderate in ventilation.
In the ring interview, he first praised the good atmosphere created by the public and his opponent.
Then he changed his tongue to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We brought our belt today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helen's career.
There might be a chance to even get to the World Cup, Helenius commented on the evening paper before the match.
The loss could have ended the entire boxing career instead.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This doesn't get any younger, the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to the country's vice-president, Yusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult circumstances
The Saviors are searching for trapped and also the deceased in the most affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port town of Palu and its neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Palus, there is no clear picture of the Donggala situation.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The Saviors say they heard the screams of the people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
The Indonesian President, either Widodo, has ordered an army to rescue and exterminate.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area electricity and communications are being cut off in many places.
Fuel reserves are also dwindling.

The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
A pause of thought caused laughter in the audience until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Must be something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers of Sydney University have outlined two slightly different types of "cool": generally attractive cool and, in part, opposite dissident cool.
According to the researchers' description, cool people had many socially desirable features: they were outward-looking, friendly, friendly and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They craved experience and cared little about external evaluations.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The tough guy's role in the long run is not cool: a high status in a teenager does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is the story of the American study published in the Child Development Journal in 2014.
Young people who dated early, partied, went to the good-looking crowd and sought to be popular with others, had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they once did their most unnoticed peers.
High-status signifying luxury cars, braces or watches do not make you cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with people wearing a normal supermarket shirt than wearing a brand shirt - despite the fact that most people chose a brand shirt when they got to know each other.
If you're on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
There's a typhoon about to hit it. The weather warning is screaming red.
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland on average over a six-month period.
The Zorbas Hurricane will hit Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared for this if you are in the region of Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the approach, the Greek Air Science Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The coming storm is also reported on the weather service on the Foreca blog.
According to it, the toughest shrooms in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
As a result of the comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland early in the week, blew at its toughest in over 31 metres per second.
According to Blog, however, the main concern of the storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rain.
At the weekend in southern Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water may come.
It accounts for about half the annual rainfall in Finland.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the man drooling in Love Island Finland Anku?
Comes with confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in Love Island Finland, the beautiful Anku, drooling by many men, also appears in the strange YouTube videos released in 2010 as a work aunt.
In videos Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make octopus from an old household paper roll.
Anku also shows his sympathetic style how you can make a hedgehog out of pantyhose that grows real spikes.
Now let's make Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a surprising way, Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, pantyhose and grain seeds that he makes hedgehog.
You can look at the videos below or on Ankun Youtube here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi. Will he be helping Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas trembled a little more than ten minutes after he was in front of the media.
A great tour left Lewis Hamilton, the first star of Mercedes, behind and was certainly an important moral criticism for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on a pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has gone by quite a bit.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so the departure is particularly large.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's going to be in the middle of a Hamilton Jeep approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, Bottas pilutti.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Well, let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely pleased with the success of Bottas after the race, and the Mercedes stable boss, Toto Wolff, had a taste for it.
Lewis had a plan to beat Valtteri, but he didn't make it on seven.
Valteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline came out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
To the question of whether the stable lets Bottas and Hamilton drive honestly, Wolff answered with evasive action.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteinen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series was rarely completed.
Never before have brothers ended up champions of Finland at the same time.
It was now done by the Tuusulans Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the closing rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won SM1 and Henrik won SM2.
Kiteinen Erno Kinnunen confirmed the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed the Finnish Championship in the SM4 category of two-wheel drive cars.
Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civici, started the Turku sectionals with restraint, because the starting points were clear: an investment in the leading group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to compensate while some of the extra lights failed with another special experiment.
You got to be pretty blind in that third piece.
You know, in a situation like that, you don't get to go to sleep.
On Saturday, only the second series was followed by Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told us.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
The Foreign Minister, Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Mr Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and according to him the war against terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their country of origin.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel reported in Germany that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, with the participation of the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV.
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people on the screens.
In the United States, the full-force Supreme Court judge's nomination drama attracted at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Mr Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Professor Blasey Ford of California, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the consultations were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC reported that the Livestream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported a record of a year of 8.2 million live transmission.
CNN will rise by more than 10 million, including those who have followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million start-ups.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV ratings come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be staggering anyway.
Not many people reach $20 million.
More than 20 million spectators in the United States are usually only available for sports matches and the big Oscars and Grammy gala in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 also presidential debates.
It's a long way to go for the American football league's final game at the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered approximately 103 million people around the screens on NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress looked at nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million inaugurated people.
It's a top priority.
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Anton Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to stop the then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was, on a number of issues, the so-called balance language, the voice of which was able to resolve the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided by his vote that the same sex were entitled to marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his heels.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock down the court's conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only the parents of children under 10 years of age can see the health records of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, the situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of young people.
In autumn 2016, a temporary correction was made for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but they have taken an astonishing long time to be corrected.
Now the repair is in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an honest thing.
After that, the layman's understanding is about the push of a button: now that the wire is held, open it.
Of course, a child can show his parents what he knows if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is paid for, and you can't even get bank IDs from a 10-year-old.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of the fourth grade of primary school except by asking for them printed.
It is not so much a question of parents' rights as children's rights.
It is extremely important for the care of a child that parents can be involved in it.
The right to privacy of teenagers must of course be respected.
Minors can also have family situations where all things cannot be freely spoken about.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI started clearing the charges of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to American media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate's Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani.
The captured scamper continued to roll around in the chamber.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "calm down."
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on the night of Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities are reporting a case that began when a fair 30-year-old man filed a violent suit in a downtown restaurant.
He first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, he hit her, too.
Triple assault led to the call of the police.
Patrol picked him up and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will tell you.
Suspect was still acting aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "calm down."
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent resisting of an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawesi - "Clean Water is The Most Urgent"
The UN Children's Organisation Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, "says Kirsi Haru, Finnish Information Manager at Unicef.
The local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency response capability, "says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both the survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palu, the rescue operations are underway in Sulawesi, but in the Donggala area, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, "says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often light-structured, so the damage caused by the earthquake and the tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - first of all tents, for example - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent.
First, most people can be offered water purification tablets that Unicef also has in stock.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, for example, trucks will be the first to transport water.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and family reunification is one part of Unicef's mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously collected will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started raising money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is closing a $20 million fine for tweeting.
Elon Musk, the founder of space rocket and electric vehicle companies, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his duties as Chairman of the Tesla Electric Company and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk will resign as part of the agreement he entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing Musk will avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk for securities fraud because of the tweet he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he was preparing the withdrawal of the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to preside over the Tesla government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" in its government and include two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay a similar fine of $20 million to the financial controller.
Tweets misled investors.
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to a billionaire tweet, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 a share.
Tesla's share price increased by more than 10% a day after the tweet, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he had claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other management group or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate fell by 14% when the securities supervisor SEC reported a fraud charge.
The agreement is expected to reconfirm the company's course.
The last sentence is not the reason
Of course, the bell at the Cathedral doesn't ring when the hands don't move.
It's a technical flaw.
The bell on the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The smarts point at 12: 00.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: while the church crypt would be exorcised and the organ would sound all by itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It's been visited by a repairman, but some part of it has broken and is expected to have a new part, "says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
It is stated in the account that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me church bells don't ring because of a glitch.
