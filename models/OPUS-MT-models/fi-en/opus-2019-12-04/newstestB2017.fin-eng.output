A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the steps of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Forensics Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job as a chef at the San Francisco Sons & Dauphers restaurant six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Dauphers restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells me Frank lived in hostels first, but he had finally got his shit together.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us, "says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who ran along with the flow.
Despite all the wrongs that have occurred in the world, he was a diamond that was rough and shined every day, "he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
The stripping junior doctors are calling for new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialist doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and requested permission for further industrial action in the context of a dispute over a new contract of employment.
The Committee on Junior Medicine (JDC), a member of the British Medical Union (BMA), is asking for support from its entire government for further industrial action from early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved the problems of the agreement.
The agreement with BMA was rejected by junior doctors and medical students during the July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the Chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to the members of the JDC on Twitter, saying that the government 'persisted' on the issues which, according to Mr McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: 'In the light of this, the JDC Government has voted against the new draft agreement in its entirety and calls for new formal negotiations to take place on all our concerns.
In response to the Government's silence, the Government of the JDC has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government asking for authorisation for gradually expanding industrial action since early September. "
Because of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of BMA Junior Doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
Mr Malawana said to the members of the BMA at the pre-voting meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and that it would apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally conclude the eight-month war on words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even with his own restraint.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin - according to a report - five times.
I couldn't keep count myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood the opposite of his enthusiasm.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara with strict words and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an assumed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real confidence.
Public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media ran a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas dominated by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
At the end of the day, this meeting took place only so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a severe truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown last month in a failed coup d'état.
He has also clearly been shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
Reconciliation is also an economic factor.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter ban, because, normally every year, several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast.
This number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be sighed by the relief when air transport can be continued in the end.
They put their faith in the late season rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was written in Vedemost's article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
The Ankara is angry with the West because it believes that the West has a silent reaction to the coup attempt.
Not to mention the old resentment of Turkey's snail-driven accession negotiations and Putin's intervention in matters, which is eager to exploit the cool relationship and break the ties of Turkey to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities following the attempted coup d'état.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own indignant concern about the change of power.
In this way, Russia and Turkey could, at their summit, convey the image described by an analyst as an 'outside alliance': two countries which feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a self-image as a peace-building force, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a great deal that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents reported at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of their differences, while Mr Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries as to where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by a NATO member, Turkey, when shooting down a Russian fighter plane, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are once again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that in future it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the global objectives of the bank.
The bank had to withdraw from its objectives when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was saved.
During this period, RBS has been used by brand strategists to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sport, such as the Six Nations rugby and the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands go into the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWets, except for the head office and the stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to the BBC Scotland: "The RBS is becoming an investment brand and because we are working for our staff, because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our ambitions are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands. "
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nations rugby and has increased the profile of different brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"Now is the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically it is about how we can make the bank better for our customers," says the Bank President.
"Three years ago it would have been very ironic if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and that we would have introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customers' needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right. "
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilection to win in Newmarket and won his 3,000.
Dettori sprayed champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant $3,000 to him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000 in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the course of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in a race running on a steady track.
The same has been achieved in the past by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time master jockey dettori, who used to win in Ghayyr, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the line because my family's here, too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and I feel great humility. "
Dettori will take the cheering with Predilection after his victory.
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins.
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical excellence is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the racing game, his enthusiasm and dissipation have brought fans to the sport for years. "
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the Great Britain Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a vivid person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey. "
Frankie Dettori vented his accomplishments in a sort of emblematic way by flying off his horse.
"From flying goals to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won a number of big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996, "Magnificent Seven," but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned because of drug abuse.
When the competition ban ended three years ago, he had difficulties starting up, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his sceptics and returned to his best.
And for a while now, he's not about to finish his career - Dettori has recently said that he wants to continue his career at least until he's 50. "
Putin fired Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the information provided by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration ', but no grounds for dismissal were provided.
Anton Vaino, acting as Deputy Head of Ivanov, was appointed to the post since 2012.
The deceased, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he headed the President's Protocol Department and the Government Office, "explains the Russian-speaking website of the Kremlin.
Mr Vaino thanked Mr Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task for the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented. "
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Vaina as his successor.
Are those smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB history.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian State television, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, few people are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Is the firing a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very sceptical about the official assertion that a man who is praised for being a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, in which he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complicated and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been Head of Administration of the President for four years and eight months. "
Ivanov took over the post in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as Head of the Federation Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might come after the second term of President Putin of Russia, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third period.
However, the mission went to another person close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Mr Putin became Prime Minister and then he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
The star of the Criminal Mines - FBI Researchers series, Thomas Gibson, was fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent incident on the set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, reported that they had been fired in their joint press release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as Gibson, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I am sorry that this has happened, "she says in her press release.
Information on how to write Gibson's character out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, will be reported in the press release of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, 2005.
"I love Criminals and I've put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a press release published on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the end of the series, but that's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important ones: the best fans the show could ever have wanted. "
The 12th production season of the series will start in the United States on 28 September.
Mysterious landing of fish in the Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are sandeel fish, which have been sucked into the land by a hurricane.
Bain, which lives 500 metres from the sea, published video footage in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry Bridge is now connected to Fife
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry overpass and the ground bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "chicken threats" which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the Minister of Finance, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to have its concrete cover cast in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted into place. "
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urinalysis for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower column road cover, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side (i.e. on the ground).
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the North Land Bridge.
This was a massive and, at the same time, a high-precision operation.
Massive because the soil has 222 metres in length and about 6,000 tons in weight and had to be pulled up at an angle of approximately 3%.
And highly accurate because the tolerances that the working team had to comply with were very small - only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well. "
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department is about the miracle rescue of three men.
Three men on board the water from Anglesey's fishing boat were miraculously saved.
Moelfre RNL's Marine Rescue Station issued an alert on Friday at 13.20 local time following the detection of an accident by its crew in the bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless passage without a pilot.
"We saw a boat circling right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives a lifeboat in Moelfren.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately driven the boat far away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third one, aged 60, was found exhausted in a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal lifeboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who have been exposed to water are still alive and in perfect condition.
There was an emergency fire extinguisher rope in the boat's engine, but for some reason it had been severed from the man driving the boat when it crashed.
They were very lucky on their way. "
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the last decade, many people have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their squares.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, screen time was taken only by watching TV, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It is therefore amazing to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go craze. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also produced a series of drawings, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also fell a little before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to the enormous interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as big as Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones to search for pokémon, which is monitored using GPS. Once the pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using a phone screen) or "hijacked."
Wildlife has taken a generation of people playing video games younger and pulled their asses off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently told us about the application of the Apple Watch smart watch called the Cardiogram, which found within two days of launching the game that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it can only see the raw physical activity data.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have been echoing deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
Patients who regularly move are less likely to suffer from cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health support issues - exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it's possible to even make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon, too, is disgraced by the spoils of joy.
And, yes, when someone plays, they can walk towards the door.
What about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because while smart phone applications such as Fitbit could have followed your activity in the past, they did not give us any reason to start moving, as Pokémon Go does.
The new charm will disappear, and the use will decrease in due course.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of the people who go after them and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's racketeering multi-match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
It's easy on the boom.
Chin-jawing on the perm.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The American 19-year-old scaffolding gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the United States will be playing at the World Series of Women's Ride Gyms in Rio 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
He became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time who won the multi-match championship, thereby consolidating his reputation as the best of his generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his final total points became visible and his long road to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species into completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class as other superstars in sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and punctual programs that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest scaffolding gymnast ever."
In Brazil, there was still one final competition, which took place above all between Biles and his own expectations and those of the oversized world, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Going home to Texas Spring with less gold medals than a handful of them would be a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver in a women's gymnastics competition in the finals of a multi-match on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a score on i with the national team coordinated and now retiring to Martha Karolyi's farewell party.
Although Mr Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which contains a volt series known as his trump card - is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
Boorman found the girl while he was on a day-care trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching.
He has not lost any multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak will probably continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was the boom and the permanto where Biles is the defending champion of the world.
He got back to lead position after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the final result by 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for the final points - which was a mere formality - and tears began to appear around the red, white and blue sparkly stripe of Biles when the dream he wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a slight rematch to the competition four years ago when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a rerun.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader the Americans call the team's "grandma" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from losing position to winning, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's tweeting earlier this week and widespread tweets now have a completely new meaning:
Police report three serial killers listening to music in a car.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most destructive massacre in Phoenix in ten years. The victims sat in a car and listened to music when they were shot, says a police release published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, a car parked on the street on 12 June was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, according to the press release.
The police suspect that the triple homicide was not caused by a robbery because the assailant didn't take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of the second adult victim.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the murder has anything to do with the four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in Latin American populated areas within four months.
"It is common for events to occur in residential areas outside their homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
Suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that the perpetrators are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Malah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the trio had often sat in a car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a report of a shooting on an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple murder, and in both cases the shooter is believed to be the same.
Forensics found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has a microcephaly, which is the birth of a small head due to the genetic disorder of her mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get away with this.
I'm not gonna get away with this.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are committed to it, "he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a rollator.
Edmund sat up and didn't start walking until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and he loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invention of a sign that he means "sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean the usual sign language; it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
The symptoms and predictions vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people who are infected with the zika virus.
Picciuto reminisces of the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying," What happens to us? "
What will happen to us? "
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you. "
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rainfall and widespread flooding, and more rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in Southeast Louisiana and South Mississippi flood over their cores and spread across the area as a result of heavy rainfall.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Response, says that the Office receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipavia County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most South Louisiana.
According to the weather service, there may be an additional 76-127 mm of water entering the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River, Baton Rouge and the Amite River, Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana are predicted to reach record heights.
According to the wearer Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that the floods downstream in Ascension County constitute a threat, as the flooded rivers are slowly emptying into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the state of Mississippi, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
The rescue work continued in Amita and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday near Gloster among the survivors.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek river, which normally is more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other half of the boy who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and there was water on a continuous feed," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years that she lived in the region.
Hansford tells us that he and his family have all suffered injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had saved all three of them in a big army-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
The wearer, Krautmann, says that floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rain continues and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was soaked after the rain started on Wednesday.
The authorities report that due to heavy rainfall and flooding of the streets, the residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and training hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipaala City Council had informed the subsidiary WWL of the TV and radio company CBS that 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County leader Robby Miller reports that 72 people and seven pet animals were rescued by the authorities who had been caught by the flood.
For the evacuated, shelters have been opened in the cities of Amita and Hammond.
"They will return to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa, almost twenty streets were closed due to the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, Member of the City Council.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued to be steady along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, "says Rupert Lacy, Chief Rescue Officer of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported to be flooded, but on Friday, so far, nothing had been reported.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has been living in the Amita region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has received multiple bullets into his body, is surviving a shooting in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another six-year-old who has been shot in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents told me on CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to his grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital, and he's had several surgeries.
The family will tell the network that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old male were also the victims of the shooting.
Another 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, "says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, a child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men might have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault-type casings originating from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters and they have been actively involved in the shooting, "reported Anthony Ginaldi, Chief Inspector of the Philadelphia Police to the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
The other 6-year-old who was the victim of the shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while playing outside her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic team for women's scaffolding, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, this team's three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and the surprising and masterful scaffolding programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a women's competition in a multi-match.
Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
These are the views at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be the case during gym hours throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic team for ruckus gymnastics will have only four gymnast, and this is Marta Karolyin's last year as a coach.
The reality is, however, that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnast trains mainly in private scaffolding clubs run by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, travel, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (coaches, gymnast and family members), etc.
The premises of most of the stand gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activity.
The teaching of scaffolding gymnastics takes place in these clubs and represents a costly and long-term commitment for the families of the gymnast.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have both trained sport enthusiasts since they started scaffolding.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible stand gymnastics for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own scaffolding department 20 years ago.
My Harlem organisations have provided free or affordable access to stand gymnastics for over 15 000 young people (mostly black and Latin American), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my home town of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality stand gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings long-lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start scaffolding, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes in pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but the proposal was rejected by 37 000 so-called junior doctors, i.e. 58% of specialist doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, the Minister for Health, Mr Hunt, announced plans to force the agreement and said that the British public health system (NHS) was "nobody's land" and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move on to a new agreement that will include changes to the practices of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, delivered an opinion last night saying: "Junior doctors continue to have great reservations about the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even unresponsive to attempts at discussion.
Even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for further industrial action. "
The previous strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13 000 routine procedures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors.
Ministers hoped to conclude the debate on the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British trade union representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend pay for 54 000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Labour fighting measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already at the extreme borders and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the junior medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the detection of malfunctions.
The workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector - was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May. "
Day about 2.40 €paying medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive a daily dose of about 2.40 €of paying medicine when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anti-clotting medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the British Public Health System (NHS), has instructed patients to receive ticagrelor for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS), which is now part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has advised patients that ticagrelor should be administered for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, around 140 000 people have a heart attack every year, of which one quarter will have another heart attack or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the build-up of fatty material in the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks out, it can pass through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
A ticagrelor manufactured by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE programme published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg, followed by aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "While effective treatment methods are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms effectively, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will have a new stroke or stroke - often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative effect on the quality of life of a person.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who will benefit from it. "
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly as regards the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft programme does not recommend the use of a treatment method for longer than that.
Due to the climate of political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, which led to a report by the government.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes of a widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, revealing today's government report.
The former government minister, Sir Eric Pickles, strongly criticised the police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud "because of the intolerance to ethnicity and religion."
According to Mr Pickles, who is now known as the former Minister of Regional Government and the current anti-corruption force figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside the polling stations in order to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
The report also proposes to dip fingers in indelible ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
The whistle-blowers should be protected more, "says Sir Eric.
He called for better access for journalists to the Council of State documents and to the decisions of informal committees and working parties.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and a culture that favours them in wider local administrations," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the vote of Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special election court ordered the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, to resign from office on account of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman 'slandered' the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamism.
Rahman was said to "base his campaign on the religious duty of every religious Muslim to vote for him."
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulent in that the person voted by pretending to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraudulent postal election in which the senior members of the Muslim community were told to put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (picture) made a number of suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the older members, particularly in communities with a background in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There was concern that... government institutions had turned a blind eye to this kind of action" because of the politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the processing of postal ballot papers by political activists, in order to prevent 'vote-harvesting'.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider options requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Dipping your fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
systematic checks to ensure the nationality and the right to vote of voters;
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition on political activists to deal with filled-in sounds and mail envelopes.
The police have the right to establish security chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhanced training to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person can enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought following the Tower Hamlet case.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the threshold for criminal evidence was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient "tick checks" of the municipal council's electoral lists.
"Last year's court ruling in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and hidden electoral fraud and its denial by some."
The likeness of the Olympic biker with Duchess Catherine and other doppelganger fad at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went wild from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance with the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the games in Rio and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the US men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the doppelganger of Duchess Catherine seen on the bike tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be an actress's favorite Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the US men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter after he was released, in which he was startling to resemble the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I personally do not see the resemblance as such, with the exception of beard and mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the London Games in 2012, British leghold jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were raised in the resemblance, which will no doubt be brought up even more in these races.
The great and obvious Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the double of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known as Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of an actor in the Inception film.
Similarly, for a long time, the resemblance between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnet has been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalyne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the US team is a "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt" according to his fans.
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter-series actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other with their faces and faces.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if a couple's likeness is a good reason.
A tweet recently expressed his satisfaction that "others on the Internet agree with the resemblance of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and Dexter-series actor really do resemble each other with their faces and faces.
Many have noticed a resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna! for Gabrielle Union wide smiles.
The CBC Olympic Commentator apologizes for saying that a Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth rather than women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message dismayed the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canada's public service broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost by the smell" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Briefer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to trigger his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC report team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that. "
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1: 57.79, and remained in Canada for 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to swim in China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC spokesman just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air. "
In the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle final, the Chinese Ai Yanhan was described as: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with fierce comments from Byron MacDonald criticising, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweets didn't hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
The tweet and Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist bunch. # Disgusting. "
Mr Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted what Mr MacDonald said: "We apologise for the comment on swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we regret that this happened. "
In the end, the CBC had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr Scott Russel, the commentator, was forced to apologize on behalf of Mr MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to more than 90 other tweets who complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they were broadcast.
On last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the record, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for what he said. "
On Thursday evening, Mr MacDonald made his apologies on the air and tried to justify his speeches by saying that he did not mean it as personal.
"I would like to apologise for the comment I made last night following the communication of women," said MacDonald on the CBC Olympic mission.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I did not mean anything degrading in my words, and I am very sorry. "
In Primark, uninhibited underwear in the middle of the shop, the woman who made up for the store shocked customers.
Clients didn't know where to look when a woman got undressed in the middle of Primark to try on her underpants.
He made things worse by judging what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and finally tried four pairs of underpants in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkänne.
Primark store in Folkestone Bouverie Place where a woman tried on underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells me what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
He wasn't trying to do it without being noticed, he was doing it without any shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took his underwear off and apparently he didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like anything about it, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he'd been wearing. "
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent Town, continues: "How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking home a pair of underwear that someone else has worn and has not been washed."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the staff of the store tried to remove these clothing items from the sale when the woman had left - which is correct.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without being washed afterwards, "more Davidson.
The spokesman of Primark commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone shop on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn from sale. '
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Association in New York and asked him how to cope with a gun-wielding robber or assailant.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the line, "says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun so that it remains between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant in the knee to the groin, and when he goes in pain double-fold, slap him in the face with the barrel of a gun and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
Technique is equivalent if an armed assailant approaches the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist into the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun targeted at the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Look at the video and see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash unless you're the Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright licks one of Europe's dirtiest places.
The British world traveler put his resistance and cappenreflexes to the test by licking Europe's dirtiest and most repulsive places.
Suffolk host and tour guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknote, handrail in Piccadilly Circus, the flush button for the train's toilet and the Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where his tongue was being pushed.
The experiment was made into a documentary film by Ian Wright on the trail of internal power, and the results came as a surprise.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are found in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals on the confirmation of good intestinal bacteria and on his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad-taste mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by travelling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
The licking of the handrails of the railway stations and the flush button of the toilet undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "I've been pretty carefree since I was a kid about my health and put a lot of things in my mouth, like dirt, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really showed that he was worthy of his reputation.
Raja met only in a filthy public bathroom in Russia.
The Luminometer measured over 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border met in the Russian public bathroom where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units - in freshly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright is going on in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright, on the trail of internal power, which makes the number of bacteria visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in a toilet.
4,000 units, nothing is dirtier than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here. "
Wright produced a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the trail of inner power in cooperation with Valio.
Wright was given from Valio Gefile, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance in the gut.
Valio's category manager Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we ended up asking Ian to come with us. "
The health of the intestines has become a global trend.
"Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestines has become a global trend and the document enables us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor! "
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian bathroom, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some targets, while some of them were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape. "
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the welfare of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58% reported that they had used at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
Before the eviction, the disturbing family destroyed a rental house owned by the city in Saltash, Cornwall.
The troublemaker family left behind 50 000 pounds of damage to a rental house owned by the city after being evicted due to the terrorist activity of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from her apartment in Cornwall in Saltash following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company found the apartment to be in a state of repair.
There were opening holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on the floors and the walls had been rubbed with graffiti.
The couple have moved now, and they're believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says that she fears that the apartment may no longer be able to be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to weigh up because the property is likely to be known as a less pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name. "
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, family tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating the nearby population, using and caring for drugs and loud screams, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an order on antisocial behaviour in June.
In several rooms in the building under threat of demolition, old waste was found.
The house had previously been sold drugs and floorboards had been ripped off.
Neighbors say the family was fighting on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forced the couple out this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction - they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times. "
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted. "
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were called in regularly.
Trash and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and family behaviour, as eviction is always the last measure considered by the Cornwall Housing Agency.
This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my group, the police in Devon and Cornwall, and to the members of the community who took part in the work and offered boldly to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send out a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted. "
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their late 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after the eviction.
Housing workers now need to clean out the waste piles around the house.
The police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's tombstone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been told to move into a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were tainted with graffiti.
The police say they're calling for eviction of tenants who violate the tenants' rules.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction is a clear warning to the tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they wish without charge, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-ridden army jet frightened tourists in Portugal
The sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at an astonishing low altitude.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were alarmed when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes near to the point of contact on the beach from tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose to their feet with understandable concern about the thrusting of jet engines that began to hear before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographers of the dramatic passing and the videos of the social media were Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveiro experienced a shock when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at an overwhelming low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by the nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Force this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected
In January-June, the Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksete) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Eksete is trying to shorten the waiting list this year.
The exote covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government of Exote will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border Rangers took a military oath in Imbola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military jury for the officers of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Imbola on Friday.
The jury of the 10th Special Border Jäger Course was held on the garrison's sports field.
A military oath was taken by 70 armed men.
Special Border Jacks are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied to be a special-border ice ranger.
They were invited to the selection tests for 250 of them.
Since 2007, special border jammers have been trained in Imbola.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in a veteran meeting at the grand jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
- Criminal investigation helps solve crime and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has operated as an RTA or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Chief Executive Officer, Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, "says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various types of investigation for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information on asylum seekers.
Modernisation of the most recent working methods
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police would not go anywhere until they got the alert.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will be used to target daily police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in the country.
In Vantaa, the PTR centre, in connection with the Central Criminal Police, is the national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, work in areas shared by the police services and are responsible for providing information to both the local police and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA is to know what is going on in the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA have computer skills better than the basic police.
With the help of registers, the alert function database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called "sequencing," and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Well, according to the M.O., the unsub is a certain kind of image.
Compilation can be done either by method or by person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
Neither own nor criminal methods are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thereby trying to prevent police crime-fighting attempts.
The police will report on the methods in public if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, in early summer, such a case was reported by the way in which empty dwellings were recorded during break-ins.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the outside door of the apartment to see if the residents were really on the road.
The evidence submitted shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has discovered that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest will order the minutes of the district court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found.
Next time, we go to the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, an interview has been conducted with Deputy Chief of Police, Tero Seppälä, Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola, Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi, Joensuu Police Station, and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela, Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage reform of the PISA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the boundaries of your own institution and Finland.
The London schoolgirl who joined the fathers was killed in Syria.
The news tells us that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee says that the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike against Raqqa, an Isis base in Syria, reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, it was precisely planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning and testament so that people can understand that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone - which will make people give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, together with two other Oriental schoolgirls, got on a plane to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
The President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court judge if he is elected President.
The Republican Senate representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge, Anton Scalia.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he was predicting Clinton's choice of Garland "with a great deal of certainty."
Reid's spokesman later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton as to whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Columbia County.
Reid says that the Republicans who block the nomination of Garland are "commanders" and "facilitators" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats, naked calendars belong to women as well as men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in 1970's style and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of using the NU Muses model, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told us earlier this year that his newspaper, which oozes naked, differs from the Playboy papers in the old school, because he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this for the ladies. "
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, just as men, can enjoy and inspire these images of the female body," says Shaw in the press release on the calendar.
"I'm sure women will want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to model a calendar can send photos online or participate in open selection sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write in the commentary section your angry objection under the title Not All Solitary Middle Age Men, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, the new appearance of much-spoken vinyl discs is not a millennium-generation boom, when the millilenals want to feel a physical object in their hands, but rather a mid-life nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, people in age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a question of the desire of the enthusiasts to hunt records; it is a matter of emotional importance: older buyers of vinyl plates are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% to 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% to 66%).
But are the results of Yougov true?
If this blog were a televised news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walk along the lively Soho Street, wearing a jewelry-free gray jacket suit. I'd make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness after hotels, Eatsi, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special disc stores left.
I would probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment when I come very close to the men visiting these shops and try to observe their age and nature.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (two young women, three middle-aged men at the time) Reckless Records (eight middle-aged men at the time, one woman probably in her 20s) is on a conference trip to London for the afternoon and spends an extra amount of time getting to know what shops are offering.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of things in the late '60s and early' 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my vice. "
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human stream that has been affected by media jumping, and these people have heard about the vinyl disc coming again and are now feeling compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on the discussions that I had had, people had usually given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back, "he says.
This could explain the vinyl-waking boom of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you realize that they provide a comforting community for similar-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset with the unconnected payment system.
The digital world may confuse some of the vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disk cases means perseverance and reminds them of the lucky days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or material property into some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I feel as a collector myself, and I believe so too many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off of things. "
"We're like social workers!" goes to Wez's colleague behind the disk pile.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of the buyers of vinyl disk have no own record player at all.
At this point in the news, I would probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
There is also a "trophy" phenomenon associated with the new appearance of vinyl discs, identified by Jonny, 42, the seller of the Sound of the Universe (three middle-aged men at the time).
"A customer came to the store recently and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead album so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they still exist.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients are telling us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby. "
The customer base is much more varied in Fopp, where I come next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
The clients are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is gratifying, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: instead of the rolling jazz on the speakers, the Wild Beasts' latest sex-oozing synthesizer.
None of our clients seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the Fop for a few minutes and watching various disks.
He's looking rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect records.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the finesse of the wine is... "he lets a lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they were jumping on denim shorts, but instead they gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter who are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the main boards for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior element and some of them are so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure art vinyl decor.
But given that all the means to attract attention to these disks may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most also has the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my studies are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist in both record stores and online platforms.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or working life.
I'm sure they won't spend their Thursday mornings grooming at Berwick Street record stores, browsing disks and avoiding a 30-year-old TV host who's staring spooky and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living vertebral column - video report
Scientists say the world's longest living vertebrate is an ice shark.
According to the shark investigator Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice shark was between 272 and 512 years in the study, which was a 5-metre-long female.
The French court dismissed the application for the dissolution of the jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities made allegations that the state should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell different kinds of tobacco to the inhabitants of the refugee camp and offer haircuts.
According to the Prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the black economy and because of the risk of fire and hygiene.
The humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, because free meals provided by a state-sponsored organisation and others are not enough for an ever-growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those who need them.
The Court ruled that there was no legal justification for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect to be "fully understandable '.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the food shops, cafes and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than simply providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, which is non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors with the most vulnerable status.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition requiring children's cafés to be kept.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of over 9,000 people.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are becoming sharply lower to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
From the analogue countries only in Britain the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
These data derive from the writing by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010's, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turn, and since then, food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now heavy by the ban on food imports imposed by Russia, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased competition in the prices of industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown to be a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, although food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in the EU countries with a level of wages similar to that of Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continued to compete in prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
School's not what it used to be.
Returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of the fine print is abandoned, and instead, schools start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start at the fourth grade.
The main change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebral column was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the polar shark is known as the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), which only reaches maturity at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate species in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland shark is swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the dogs, they can grow up to over 5 meters.
Given the slow rate of growth, according to monitoring only about one centimetre per year, adult individuals have inevitably lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen looked into it.
He defined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks examined proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 43- and 502-inch Amazonia fins, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
As previous studies have shown that polar sharks only reach maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman fired nearly 300 people, and they're not going to cut down on the sellers.
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his press release.
According to this, the number of sales agents in department stores is not reduced in order to avoid suffering customer service.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned about 3 000 workers.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background to Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store business profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store trade is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijainen, Stockmann's Acting Managing Director, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," says Veijalainen in the release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was especially due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the corresponding period last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday, it's the rain in the north. It's under 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure centre on top of the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, "says Ilona Láng, HS meteorological specialist.
In the middle of the country, there are also rainbows, but in the south there are coals.
The temperature is no longer very high in summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rainy areas, you stay between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt.
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became clear that Anzrah was a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-meter star Ferguson Rooch.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
The doping officers went to report to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because she "committed her crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour, "Kip Keino, President of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, was crushed by the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics will start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is known the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is an advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and they took him to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed, "the source said.
Where is everybody?
The general sports stadium in Rio is gumbling in its emptiness.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching sports.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was launched for the medals of general sport, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show their skills to a disconcerting empty bleachers.
On Friday, Rio's organisers reported that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
There was another one four years ago in London, where the stadium was full of cheering people.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic audience has attracted attention even before general sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When the Brazilian medallion Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people were only full of about 30% of the stands.
Bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian racing tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for the Brazilian people who are used to football.
Although even the first game of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
The spokesman for the organisers, Mario Andrada, told us this weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," said Mr Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets from the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though they cost almost half the cost in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 at the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to school children in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba's sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were a lot of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, which was established last year, acquires ecological habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities will be able to redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is split into virtual blocks which the interested parties can acquire in exchange for payment of the holder's right.
The holder is entitled to veto his 187 square metre block, which means in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is to be changed.
Holders' rights can also be acquired in several sectors.
Acquisition of the right of control is something concrete that can be left to inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, "explains Juha Levikangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The person who acquired the right of control receives detailed location information from his or her section, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the section.
On the Foundation's website, the list of names of holders of holder rights is displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
The only risk that the Leviathan sees is that the Foundation's activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation will act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be undisturbed and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land either by buying or by donating.
It finances mainly the sale of the rights of holders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected land.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The biggest torment of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your hometown
The biggest torment in the big cities of Finland is caused by bicycle thieves.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
The Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police, based on reported bike theft, how much bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year per 1 000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five wheel theft per 1 000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, the police were informed of only about two wheel theft per thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, twice the population of the population is affected by thefts compared to others," describes Police Commissioner Tommi Ree.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by the amount of wheels being moved in the city and the amount of wheels at all," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkkää.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board thinks that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are expected to take the lead in comparison.
The number of wheel theft is largely based on what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are separated from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the preferred means of movement," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the number of bike theft recorded by the police in the January to August period has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there's no reason to be happy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20 000 wheel theft every year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to file a crime report for bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten police reported cases will be solved.
The typical bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations, for example in a drug case where stolen bikes can be found in the apartment," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act or police investigation, "says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are being stolen, for example, from shopping centres' wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelbasements, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are most often stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on the market, for example via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some people might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or offence.
"The alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear price below cost," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a specialist librarian, always carries his colourful Nopsan for his working day in the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, "says Moose." Never been taken, a good monk has happened. "
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, this does not necessarily have a hipster value," says elk from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to attend a kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stuttered against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike to something solid, such as a bike rack.
"A lot of thought will be given to this, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, like the" Jopies "kind of thing."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valve himself from the house yard.
But the bike was unlocked, so Valve could wait to take it.
Under 15 years of age to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurors from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with the so-called peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to persons under the age of 15 who are now left with no criminal liability.
The peer jury is interfering with the first juvenile crime.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer jury himself in order to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Young man Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"Everyone steers the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young person after his first crime will not be faced with an adult panel, but will reflexes what has happened with approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path you have chosen," says Lovio.
The Peer Jury is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Young People, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need them, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican players want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Mr Rerence Priebus.
The signatories want the party money to be directed to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate allocation of all possible funds to the congressional elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States.
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the American economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in well-paid jobs after the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that is against workers or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculation published by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme announced by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for "favouring only millionaires of this kind."
The proposed discount on corporate taxes proposed by Trump has previously been called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small businesses whose invoices Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
In general, sports competitions are shown in television spectator statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached a huge audience.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens at their best: Tuesday evening's swim was followed by 615,000 viewers from the Yle Olympic channel at the same time.
For comparison: the European Championships in general sport one month ago received almost 800,000 viewers at a time to TV2, and the European Football Championships were well worth another million.
So far, the most interesting thing about Olympic sports was cycling on Sunday night and the gymnastics that opened the fifth race day, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic network.
PANU POKKINEN, Head of Sport, is pleased with the ratings and recalls that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns are following the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers are choosing the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sporting competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When it comes to 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or in the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a minor interest - if someone thinks it is weak - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the primaries, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, general sport is only just beginning, as are other species of Finnish interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the audience numbers at the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which rose to Apple App Store in the first days of the Games as the most free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
My guess is we're about 200 grand in charge.
"The ratings of the network will not be received until later." Pokkinen says
Rio Areena has not worked as hoped for by all users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games will be seen on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can track some species, and Yle Speech on the radio carries the races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most hard-working for the High, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Yle's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both the Upper and Commercial Channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, where the depth of the lake is 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technology diving instructor, found a 20-square-metre push-up on Ristiselä, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 meters, "says Jari Hakala, Development Engineer.
So so far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Kallavesi and Pääjärvi.
They haven't been studied as closely as Daytime.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
"There may well be unknown depths," says Kannela.
If the deepest lake is defined by mid depth, it is Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
From this point of view, your Day does not get into the top ten, and the Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Repair on August 12, at 14.29: The last paragraph was corrected, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Isolated from the tax area: Pensioners' taxation still tighter
The tax burden on pensioners is still higher than on employees.
The Ihalainen says that the injustice arose under the Parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept up to date after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their working income, which reduced taxation.
In this Parliament, the case was heated by opposition representatives who were grilling Alexander Stubb, the then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it will not grow
In the line presented by the Minister for Finance, Petteri Orpo (Co.), tax reductions are mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (middle) and Orpo's messages on the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says that it is important for credibility that we stick to the agreement.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment in a rickety
The honourable Member calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth, in the budgetary rivalry.
The number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of increasing the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed during the bombing in Thailand last night and last night of Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists who are going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions about caution are worth following, "says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season for Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombing.
The embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to find out about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalia, there's still no record of who did the attacks.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and to the referendum last week on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalia says.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalia says.
He says the town is celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
The traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should have an impact on the course of the day, so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, these attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, says the Thai police news agency AP.
There have been at least four deaths in Thailand in the last 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular by Finns, four bombs were detonated in the night by the resort Phuket, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs went off according to a newspaper in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs were detonated in Phang Nga, where according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
There was at least one death in each of the double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than in the south of Thailand and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it leads to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
No one knows who did the attacks.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta ruling Thailand, the attacker of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't be stirring people up to panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He said to the Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy advises Finns in Finland to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Embassy about caution, "says Westphalen.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and the victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little more information.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were injured in the second attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs went off in the vicinity of a bell tower, known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated in Hua Hin an area where they believe they have found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed according to the governor of the county.
An employee of the municipality was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The Chief of Police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half an hour or so.
Bangkok Post says the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America Biles won a four-way match for women.
Alexandra Raisman in the United States was the second with 60.098 points and the Russian Aija Mustafina the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still running for the Rion rink championships on the ass, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent over the last few years.
He's got eight personal world championships from the previous three years.
He has won four-game and permanto championships three times in a row and a boom in the last and the second years.
In the United States team, Biles has won two team championships in the world.
There are darker World Cup medals in Biles from the jump and the boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Strike has no impact on tourism"
Esa Hovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and runs a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think that this will lead to anything more amazing, the Finnish entrepreneur working in Asia for about twenty years will be judged by Hovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was avian flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these past ones haven't banished tourists, I don't think so either.
The office of the company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
The parlor found out about the attack on his own employee.
The employee called around 9: 00 in the morning and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The hotel says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up for the Queen's birthday, "says Hovila, referring to his Friday holiday in Thailand.
At the Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10: 00 local time.
At the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard about the attacks.
About half past three in the day in Thailand time in Patong traffic had normalized and a large part of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, "says Hovila, who visited the scene of the attack.
Later the car in question was seen in Kruunupya on Jouxholmintie.
By the time the police got there, the car was set on fire.
Patrol picked up two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was caught right away.
One of them ran away, but the guy was found in the woods later with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of the use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated assault.
The police thank the people who tipped us off.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear sidelining
On Friday, the highest level of leadership change took place in Russia in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Estonian-speaking Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat. He was second in command of Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from exercising power independent of the President.
It is also possible that Ivanov may have been in trouble with other managers or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other posts and proposed Vaina to replace him, "said Russia Today.
The fabric stream says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but became President Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pyhänniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, "said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of approximately 90% of the city of Manbiji, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.

Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, "says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister based the decision on the instructions of the Government Administration and on the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to the STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has run against time under the prestige.
He insulted his back legs in the early ages and had to skip the Olympic tryouts in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, "Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
The story around Porina Bolt is that the Jamaican star has risen in a time when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 metres in the early stages of 21.05.
At the time, a 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of the rivals at the end of the celebration, at the time of the birth of 9.69.
This is harder.
One year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career at a legal point in time.
The world record that was born in Berlin at 9.58 and 19.19 at two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second run-down, but nobody believes in it but Bolt himself.
With a hundred Bolt's toughest challenger, the Olympic champion of Athens 2004, Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American with only one hundred guns.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in the finals of the World Cup, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu, 2011, the 100-dollar World Cup was missed by Bolt because of a false source.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He's an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line for the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes are suspected of doping.
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the Chinese banner Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner, Silvia Danekova, is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
He ranked fourth in Rio in women's 100-metre butterfly shooting.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese banner has brought its doping case to the CAS of the International Sports Appeal Court.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that a Bulgarian female runner, Silvia Danekova, has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has sent a sports coach home from Rio because of the doping violation.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media records, this is Kenyan speed coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from a 800-meter runner, Ferguson Rotich.
The Phelps will not be stopped - historical gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympic Games, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam 200 metres in a mix in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the mix before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at a quick interview from Evening Magazine.
The article made on Monday by Helen Skelton (right) is one of the most read-out on this week's website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton won't be too stressed if there's a slight noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
I mean, the television is visual media. He's stressing it.
Skelton is dressed in high heels and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough prowess - at least for the eyes of many conservative British cats.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and the little rumors are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be a little startled, maybe even a bit alarmed, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the noise has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a rumour of nothing if it comes from (presenter) dressing.
I'm a little amused if someone's been hit by one of these things.

Argentinian dami pounced the Betrayer-Siren - Finnish contemplation protest
The wind of the Betrayer Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind, Siren the Betrayer, went through a rough time on Thursday.
The lady of Argentina, the wind of the Betrayer-Siren on Thursday in Rio on the start of the women's surfing day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, "said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete was considering a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been in vain under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, "said the Betrayer-Siren.
The Finnish man hung on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get caught in the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish was left in place 27 with the accident.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Politalist is the eighth.
The crash didn't have much effect on the tip.
Friday's a big day for the race 10-12.
Modified to 0.39: Unlike the first information, the Betrayer-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that according to science extend age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring to him extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency to mid-body or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to piss. Just pick up the milk can is enough.
There have been many studies to try to find out the secret of a long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research findings.
Science tells me that all these things may bring us more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The Harvard University study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "reduced risk of death," especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, studies in favour of alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - one to three days - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental floss can extend the life of a person for up to six years, a study says.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected the life of a person.
A seven-year project watched over 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were more likely to live by the end of the experiment than those who were more obnoxious.
Sex, where protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity will add years. It will not be denied.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute tolerance.
A study by the University of Oxford found that the cholesterol levels of women with a big butt were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won an Oscar at the Olympic Games, he's more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life for additional years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long-term life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among the over 65-year-olds found that a person shopping on a daily basis was probably less likely to be older than a shopper.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver with a dead body derailed into a truck.
On Friday night, there was a serious collision between a truck and a passenger car at Koski in Varsinais-Suomi.
The accident occurred in Koski, in the middle of the Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9: 00 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came in against it had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left in its lane after the crash, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and from there on over the ditch to the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's under suspicion of aggravated DUI.
The post office sent loose candy to the wrong town.
There were deficiencies in the selection of loose candy at Salon K-Citymarket because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candy at the Salon K-City Market when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in loose sweets because the Post delivered our load to the Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post is able to deliver the load!
So if there's no traffic on the lawn mowing, the sign said so.
The sign that foxes its shop has to do with the fact that last spring the Post extended its services to lawn mowing.
Grass mowing is on the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with surprise.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this has attracted is incredible, "says Haltia.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 breakdowns on Facebook.
Elf got his own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few floors were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesosos, responsible for the business of Business Transport Services at the Post, regretted the damage suffered by Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets were lost yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki), and we no longer went to make a part delivery (Saloon) by three, but only today took five pallets, Kaidesoa told Ilta-Sanomat.
The first news to come out is the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not upset about the sign because she found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.

District Court issued a judgment against Post for infringement of the Equal Opportunities Act
The post did not have the right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to introduce the temporary agency worker, assessed by the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the wages withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post Office could have withheld only part of the orientation salary corresponding to the share of the education throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage by virtue of his trade union activities in breach of the Equal Opportunities Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Association of the Union for Postal and Logistics Pau to ban familiarisation.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Post's employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who broke the strike.
It was first told by the People's News.

Putin fired the head of his regime... and replaced the Estonian-speaking Vaino.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired President-in-Office Sergei Ivanov, Kremlin says.
Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino, Communist leader of Soviet Estonia.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, "says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin report, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will take on specific tasks in the field of the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other posts and proposed Vaina to replace him, "says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet period in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before the re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: Departure of ManU - not seen in the opening of the League
You can't see the world record man in football moves on the field when the English Championships kick off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with him to England.
Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, "said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to the Italian Society Juventus in Pogba.
However, the English Football Association (FA) is keeping him out of the game, as Pogba was left with Juventus as a burden on the game ban.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world-class artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festar travelers have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is the punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
Flow Festival event area is stalled with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's pretty unusual for an event production to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, "says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70 000 last year by 5 000.
A number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festival this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because we have to finance the work in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, controlled by huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks in a partially artificial grass-trimmed area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, the tent of 15,000 people will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our case.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work that has been done for the Kallio is that, today, great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the company operating Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "Greek things," like the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out in terms of content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, "says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own genre, but he does not have the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a concert in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a good job in the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, the guardian of wild animals who lived in Asia, referred to a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you can't get a good look at the tweet, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bars in the world, told Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet, the Swedish tourist.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs were detonated on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with Finns.
No one died, as far as I know.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one of them died and three of them were wounded.
And another bomb went off in Trang City.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there is likely to be rebel troops behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership's actions.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations dealing with trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by force starts in a war situation
In the event of an acute war, it is not until several months after taking a military oath that military officers are ordered to fight, "says Keski Suomainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Military Training, interviewed by the magazine, the military personnel serving 5.5 months in the event of war are only able to fight those who are in the final stages of their training.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve forces are first assigned.
No conscripts or reservists are assigned to a post that has not received the required training, "says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it appeared that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel in immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a huge compensation for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, President and CEO Pauli Worma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house which caused microbial growth that was hazardous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Worma won the case both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeal.
The court of appeal issued a verdict on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the legal and procedural costs of the couple.
The right made the price reduction somewhat more moderate because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a fit home because they did not want to undertake any repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the facts mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned ventilation as risks and malfunctions and the lack of adequate management of rain- and melting-water flows along the rock study.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter in any way.
Tola and Worma were left with the impression that rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled in a few years' time.
The sales were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
In 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth due both to the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also be reached indoors, according to the inspector.
The mould or yeast, which allows health risk, was found in brush samples from the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window opener and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
There was also a dispute in the court as to whether the apartment had been extended in contravention of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Worma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to change the dwelling in breach of the permit prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although no appropriate permits were yet in place.
However, mold problems were at the heart of justice.
According to the court of appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, it could be assumed that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider that there was any particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to provide information, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive survey: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children of the Nazis - also Finns in the register
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter how documents have been stored on microfilms in the US National Archives in Maryland for a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards originate from the National Agency for Racism in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the authority of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
This was even more true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
Ratification was a study of the background of women, including through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency hand-written biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the brides of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive's documents.
The SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, it was stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, the site of the US Holocaust Museum is reported.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
The German mother was awarded an honorary prize to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were prohibited by law, as stated on the museum's website.

Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the barman of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, Finland's best selling solo artist, and the star of the dance stage and festival, Sillanpää can still boast, and she is currently in a very violent state.
The book Jari Sillanpää, which was written by Mari Koptinen, is about the life of her favorite singer, was published today, Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in good and evil.
The career of the bridge head rose to a total climb when he won the crown of the tango king on the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang thongs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppämäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of music in Finland.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: the bridge head sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
Oh, my God, I was so crazed!
The head of the bridge remembers in a book.
You wouldn't know it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to insist on being perfect and top.
The second incident related to the most popular pieces of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his former partner and the case ended up in the texts of "You deserve gold" published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara Kola were not what the Shillhead would have liked.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the chapter on divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the newspaper news, Jari and his ex-lover's divorce was attributed to Jari's excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was full of crap and it wasn't true.
Jari called the record company angry and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end of the day, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls for the week of the vote anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the resignation, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign by the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid," flew into the junk in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, is responding to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists' loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's away from the real British.
Many also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
The economist felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently evident.
They were particularly struck by the neutrality of the BBC, which allowed only a few per cent of the economists in favour of the EU divorce as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other high-level economic combinations were about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not share any common interests.
Academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant puts congestion on your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British man get a doctor's appointment if he didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for a real British kid to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they took off?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The economists did not succeed in explaining that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU-divorce camp, began to prepare for more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We left to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, "says Mr Vanhanen about the only open daily real estate fund in Aberdeen, which the news was about.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15% and 20%.
The value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, "says Vanhanen about all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was at or even below 10%.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp in favour of the EU divorce won, Europe went nuts.
However, the last few weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, "says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that the Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they raided the situation and put it in the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, "says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash collected, but it was also eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and the majority withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it has been very smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, "says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the Aberdeen continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of enquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
In his view, the closure of real estate funds' transactions received excessive attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds on the side of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ramped down, but the situation does not appear to be "wilder 'for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Mr Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Old Man says.
Brexit brought down the real estate market in London.
At 2: 00 in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at 4: 00, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, came back to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of strength.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B, "says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the early hours of the morning.
At the office, the TV screens, which were normally set to be silent, filled the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals were looking at nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd be alive, "says the Old Man.
It is not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate transactions on the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. on the midsummer.
It was a mixed mood.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that was why the situation was in a sense calm, "says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went in for a change.
The market was beginning to anticipate drastic reductions in the real estate market in Britain and in particular in London.
The London office premises were expected to be negative by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberde did it for six days, too.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not, however, show its last summer holidays in the face of the old man who spent his summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit will do.
So much remains open: how the difference is made and how Scotland responds to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of primary information.
CBRE's data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all buildings in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the minus was generated, "says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index started to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, "says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began on the US property market.
The old man does not think that the comparison is quite right, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
The mood is different too.
The real estate market has now not seen a panic sale like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, "says Mr Vanhanen.
You can find a financial balance as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he does not think that the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of real estate in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, "says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a very high level.
London prices have been tightening upwards for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, "says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has meant, for example, that pension companies have had to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Mr Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used much less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Spread out, scatter, scatter
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, "says Vanhanen.
Aberde also started to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's next?
That depends on how the British economy develops, "says Mr Vanhanen.
A lot he's afraid to judge for the future, but he says there's probably not much to go on.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even trend ahead.
The old man has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can handle the holes with work.
If you are well prepared for risk, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, "says Vanhanen.
S-group starts to register purchase data more closely than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group today told us that it will start collecting more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, when information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start to collect it at the beginning of May for purchased products as well.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most powerful channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information, "says Riitala.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to grocery purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil, for example, do not give up their knowledge.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty program and is not currently planning to do so.
The Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkönsbonus customer-client program, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer loyalty programme is to be revised in the future, but the close-up shop will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
The customer register and the customer register of SOK have been relatively wide until now.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data included occupation, education, housing and birth years of children and past personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-Front card purchase records the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, the information provided by the S-bonus partners is derived from their cash schemes.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismas, Terror Home and ABC chains data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, "says Marjaana Saarikoski, customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they will inform their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the checkout, whether they like it or not.
The person wishing to do so may check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cashiers have no access to the data, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tulli's latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever puppy is vigorously sniffing five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio awards his Heila dog to play with that favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of shells that smelled like gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Main reasons for security and online commerce
Heila is Tulli's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, work may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job of Heila because the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs and, following the attacks, controls have been strengthened, "says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gundog and an explosive dog in Tulli's tasks is mail through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail deliveries via the airport every year may include foreign-ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors, from the purchase of online shops at Helsinki Airport, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, "says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Mrs Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio will also attend training with Heila with police and military experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs, and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what odours Heila is taught to identify.
Helila is always further trained as needed, "says Grönberg.
Helila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and Massi, a money and drug dog.
The Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected at the airport include a high-speed and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila is close to the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
There's nothing you can do without Hila at home. Suntio's laughing.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time shot.
The evening-message cameraman loses the camera's microphone to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy guard immediately on the "off" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be ready next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in Helsinki Airport on the next half of the year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to ironing the dog on top of the vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work rates only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Tulli.
Hila's owner was applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Fortune hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The mini-state received its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off
Fiji's Olympic gold in rugby, with less than one million inhabitants, is valued so high that the government has ordered 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the nation's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed this after the championship was over.
The day off will be the day after the team gets home.
There will also be celebrations for the Hero Team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian tells us that there was a final in the country in Suva, capital, where a screen had been erected on the stadium.
Normally only native Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheer, said the Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lift fainted after a wild performance
Milko Tokola, the weightlifter, succeeded with his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a unique and life-threatening feature for a lifeguard.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got 175 kilos of labor in Rio and 145 kilos of stunt.
He came in at 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push at the last 175 kilos, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights were raised by a lot of screaming.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finnish lifeguard was caused by the fact that he has suffered knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian invader Prosa - The League of Values - Evening-Messages
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a long-term contract with the Estonian invader Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player with a low threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good option, "says Juha Malinen, coach of RoPS in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the Tallinna Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goalKing Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The daring Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with Alex Dunphy as a modern Family comedian, flashes again by showing her threatening body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet, but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making her style and behaviour much bolder.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very sparse outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look it up here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At that time, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter was only 11 years old when he was in Modern Family.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time, when the downhill is already so tough, says a woman at Winter's Instagram.
Some women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, glowing up a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see the stormy mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese visitors to start Northern Lights as early as early autumn, "Visit Finland explains in the press release.
The main destinations for Japanese northern lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
There is a strong demand for northern lights trips in Lapland in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the northern lights season starts from early autumn and goes on to long spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times a fairy tale, "says Anne Lind, Vice President Marketing of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign focuses on wealthy women aged 25 to 35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the country among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lind, the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, "Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby-7 race when Fiji's champion team won gold.
Great Britain's impressive success in the rugby competition of seven players was crushed when Fiji won it in the final of the Rio Deodoro stadium on Thursday, 43-7.
Fidzi taught masters in ball handling, transfers, sidelining, supporting games, running lines and raw power, winning gold - if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a bit more thin for Britain, because it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first Rugby-7 tournament in which the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough win from the Boxes in South Africa in the 7-5 semifinals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team, in its form, would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full strength.
It may be comforting for Britain that at least one British will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, during Ryan's training, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
It hurts to lose, but progress is startling.
Fidzi started off very well and introduced his tackle skills to Great Britain as if it were for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team ran into a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a crash at the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the rugged Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal at the right angle, after which Great Britain was 17-0 at a loss.
Nakarawa scored a second goal from the extension, when the first half was still over one minute left.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the increasingly powerless tackle of the British team and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in situation 29-0.
It seemed that the Fiji people were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the sport as apprentices.
Which is very much the case.
In the middle of the day, Britain made major changes and managed to hold the Fiji people back for a whole four minutes, which, compared to the first half, was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team game played by the Fiji people.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the score to 36-7 by scoring for Britain at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the Southern archipelago, whose fans in the bleachers sang, waved tickets and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure exhilaration.
Mata Viliame did the final touch of the Fiji cake by scoring at the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fiji embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day Fidzi had won the semi-final in Japan, 20-5, and Great Britain had crept past South Africa in a tight semi-finals, where the balance was resolved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took over the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, the rugby team player of England's 15 players, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold.
There can't be any more emotional gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious strokes into history and found an added purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
While the two were in the oars, the third voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo, makes them the first women in the history of British sport to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39th in a row and once again record-breaking.
What we see, two great athletes floating on the water level like swans at age, is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there are a large number of helpful hands, each of which has taken a duo towards achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
If it wasn't for the surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think. "
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky to have been able to start treatment outside the season of the species in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say so in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, and I walked around six, nine, and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
The row itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger. "
Immediately after the victory, the two ideas were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan, says: "On an emotional level, I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cashier have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so, like, a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach. "
Helen Glover and Heather Stoning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The duo has found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very caught in a moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important that you do not drift off the path. "
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything amazing.
We didn't go for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did. "
Two people think about their future for a year.
Glover is celebrating his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure. "
"After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took me about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better, "he says.
Iceland will change the government that has been bugged by the Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already demanded by protestors who have been infuriated by the Panama data spills in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict the impact of the people's last spring's rage on the results of the autumn elections.
In June, the presidential elections showed clear criticism of the power-holders, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside of politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of the Isis.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States Republicans, withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic when he said that President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and that the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the army who could sink that low, Clinton txt.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkin bathing suit, which is popular with Muslims, on the beaches, says Guardia, among other things.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and to swim for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are a major expression of religious affiliation, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - blue algae opacity in Lake Pushukösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only a blue-leaf opacities have been observed at the beach in Lake Euskösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E. coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water concentrations of E. coli and enterococci were confirmed at Meriniemi beach on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity observed at the shore of Lake Euskösjärvi does not yet make the water unbathing, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, making blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water as ferries.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through more frequent inspections.
If the blue-leaved bloom turns into blue-leaved bloom, it will also be communicated separately on the table on the beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MK Hakkarainen's forest gift reduction: over 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the conversion of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal on forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hackarainen finds something to criticise in the tax amendment proposal.
A reduction in forest gifts is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkarainen argue that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales result of wood.
The VM's proposal is based on the fact that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of the income from forestry which would be deducted from other taxes.
A person like this would get tax benefits even if the wood wasn't sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to grasp it, "says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high by Hakarainen.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forest policy, according to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been carried forward for decades.
The background to this is the ageing of the forest owners' community.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about one-half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful hail deaf surprised the motorists in Himanga, two cars derailed and collided with each other.
On Friday morning, there was an unusual chase on the Himanga of the Kalajoki River.
According to the rescue department, two cars that drove in a row went into a ditch, and then the one behind them ran into the one who drove ahead.
According to the on-call firefighter, Harri Pyhankä, the fall into the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
The car in the back had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's nothing more specific about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the car above did not get hurt.
An accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to become more effective.
The findings of the Academy aprof- Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumour increases the malignancies of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of drug treatments for cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The research results were published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The murder of Muhos' family home is continuing in court, the prosecution is demanding a murder sentence for another perpetrator as well.
In the court of the court, the family home invasion of Muhos continues for both sentenced persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home murder in Muhos.
The second was given eight years for four months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The second is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The guilty party was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and the unauthorised carriage of a vehicle as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls on a man with a lesser sentence to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years in prison.
At the time they were made, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a director of the child protection unit in the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked a pilot from behind on the couch in the living room.
The pilot had gotten out of his grip and led the young to his room, and one of the young people hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time.
According to the court, young people had been planning to escape from the family home at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived backbone, growing only at 156
The world's longest living vertebrate is confirmed by the ice shark, "says the study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swimming around Greenland can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The fact that it grows only a centimeter per year increases the lifespan of the ice shark.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found out about age with the radio-carbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as financial wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's total tax revenue would not be received if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through tax cuts that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax rate would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money left to collect, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the Trump rebate of 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Mr Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the economy and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in the event of an emergency need to be reformed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed 'experts rather than bureaucrats'.
According to Mr Trump, a 'destructive' trade policy is one of the main causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be denounced.
For imports from China, a penalty tax of 45% and for Mexico 35% would be imposed.
We offer a new future.
American, not global, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his methods, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well organised protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme as taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday Finnish time.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is a fateful turmoil, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street riots - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun and raggedy satirical comedy, a prelude to the Skin where I live (2011) at the top of the career of a Spanish champion.
On a level playing field, Julie (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventional serene love, relationship and family drama, centred on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen much as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a rear and long letter, Julie times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Juliet as a young teacher, will be the second leading woman, from the TV-familiar series "The Time Between the Ommelte" (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a mess, but I would say that it is rather timely and verbatim with a single sweep.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance to such characteristic blaring, up to the humor of Juliet.
It is a film that is equally played, restrained, and has some good music and is quite sad, with elements of elegy in it.
On the other hand, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is still present and is gradually beginning to appear as a pure formality rather than as a functional drama tool.
The people in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true in the case of clothing: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from one scene to the next, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, which is the tune of the scene in question, is not going to improve in particular.
In mechanical repetition, the impression is external and a little spirit-free.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Alice Munro, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book "Runaway: Stories."
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unparalleled for more dramatic drama, that much big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the film will be dealt with.
Direction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is August 12th.
The Government is trying the election trick - People's News
No further cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of the United Kingdom do not collapse completely.
However, there are a lot of cuts decided on in the spring.
There will be no further cuts.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided are sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (third party) with a budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic protection for unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension definition are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts are continuing.
The municipal elections are haunted.
Why are the ministers so hesitant to stress that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The polls, however, tell us that the Party of Government is waiting for the Finns to lose their butts, even though the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the Parliamentary elections of 12.3 per cent.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new councillors, most of which will be realised next spring by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three governments of a party of about equal size depends on the survival of the Finns.
Today it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the state of fermentation of the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
There will be no further cuts in rhetoric, firstly, to obscure the fact that next year they will be draconian and, secondly, to try to soften the waiting blow for the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of settling debt in this parliamentary term, but the draft budget of Petteri Orpo will take on EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not or is not slowed down.
One is to hold on to the program.
It means even tougher cuts on the former in the 2017 budget rigidities.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring we will take what comes into the parliamentary elections.
These measures did not reduce the debt ratio
It is quite clear that the current measures did not solve the debt problem, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Mr Martti Hetemäki at the awareness-raising meeting prove this unquestionably:
Projections of growth in the world economy have repeatedly proved to be university-based, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
Finland's economy has not increased much since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary recovery policy in the early 2010's.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered entirely by a new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the Finns as to what is responsible.
Questionnaire: A lot of tasks to be left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population is responsible to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building control, upper secondary education and waste management.
For their part, the province's responsibility is the province's planning, special medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks of local authority authority are intended to be transferred to the State.
At the end of the chase, the underage drunk driver ran away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu was driving a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsi Road on Friday night around half past 1: 00.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off to run from a police officer at a fair speed.
The chase continued to take place on the Sonkaajannantie, where the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, a young man ran away, but a faster-legged cop ran off to catch a fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night around 9: 15.
The truck had drifted to the left in a turning turn out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
The truck fell down and ran down into the road with hydraulic oil that the rescue department sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Air River.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 5 '6 "tall, thin and well-timed with white hair that goes under her chin.
Observations and tips on missing persons's movements are requested to call Pohjanmaa Situation Centre's tip number 0295440513.
Major material in the air - look at the photo gallery of Parafest's destruction
The surge that hit the tents of the Parafest Festival caused a great deal of damage.
The Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
At the end of Friday night, Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, performed on the stage.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances on the premises of the city theater starting at 1 p.m.
The Parafest exhibition is held at the Art Centre in Ahja between 1: 00 and 3: 00.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The plunge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the thunder are binding on heat and therefore the declining air mass is cooling and its speed towards the ground is accelerating.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is told that there are several downcurrents in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash currents.
The crash flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum of Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5: 00.
Three tents fell over, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child who was transported slightly injured to follow-on treatment.
Air pollution is aging the people of London.
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many people of retirement age in London have two and a half years older skin than, for example, those living in rural areas.
Skin aging particles are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk along congested streets on their way to work.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
The brakes of the tractor failed... pushed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not get hit by it, but the tractor did push the man to the point where he was transported to the central hospital with serious injuries to follow-up examinations.
The tractor didn't have time to run any further, because it crashed into the rocks in front of it.
The Riento with new strength for the coming season
The Olympic League-Riento, playing in the Championships of the volleyball, is going to the series starting in October from a better starting point than a male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks now.
A common tune can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when Rienno has had a gloomy beginning.
Jani Säisä, who continues to be the head coach of Rinko, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, Fred Musoni will begin his second term in Rienno.
The new face is a 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwanda national team, is a 5 '5 "picker.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team.
Anne Jumpanen has been playing at almost all the World Series of Salibandy since 2003.
Now in Tampere are already going to the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada when it was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States of America was setting up a national team for the Salibandy.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumpmann, 48, says.
Jumpanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jukmanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, they didn't yet play that kind of game on the SM level like a salibandy.
They played electricity in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the Jokiboys hockey in the SM series, Jumpanen remembers.
During the 1991-92 season, the following three seasons were played in Josba with the university.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumpanen played in the women's SM series through 10. The balance was accumulated in 169 matches 51 + 34 = 85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänen were nominated to the national team
Joensuu's Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoist Tatu Väänen to participate in the Finnish national team, which will play at the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who invades Helsinki, has previously played six men's land games where he has accumulated a total of 9 + 4 = 13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of the Swiss-based Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänen, has recovered from the pain of the thighs and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 ground games experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, a basketball player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, who was last seen in a Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, Contilahti, is the main coach of the Salibandymaa team.
Beach volley bender Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Beach Volley Finnish Championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola volleyball players and Finnish volleyball association, the Finnish Championship final tournament is eligible for the top six pairs of each series of rankings.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Eimäki NMKY, who was raised by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley championships for several years.
Today, the Helsinki resident, Hasu, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the laundry stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals in the homestead, Hasu's atmosphere.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark in sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started the volleyball when I was nine years old at the E-girls at the NMKY in Elimäki.
On top is the idea of too big a jersey, knee protectors spinning around the ankles and the staggering ace screams and choreography after the point, "Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - our teammate's father coached us and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hassel's beach volley was already a natural selection of the species to counterbalance the volleyball.
There have been songs playing at the Lake Koyräjärvi since the 1990s.
At the pulpit, the activity has always been active.
I also went on my own tour of the Junior SM tour, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Annie Parkinen from Pieksäkeläinen during the Finnish Championship finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti the goal of the second-punished duo is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack the SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws riddles.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be the last to go to Hasus in front of a familiar audience.
New challenges in civil work await us at the beginning of September.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the flip-flops will be placed on the nail.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near.
Three tents were knocked down at the Parafest festival of disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further care.
According to Karelian, there were a total of about 200 people in tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5: 00 p.m.
On-call firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karelian, tells the newspaper that there was a major accident.
According to the paper, the continuation of the event is at stake.
The great architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles in the front row
Now you can get to know more about the history of the Central Library of the Centre, when the local department of the Association of Architectural Historians in Southern California is organising a demonstration event led by Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, who have published a new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture."

Salomon Koli was brave enough to go into farming.
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working with his little brother Valtteri Koli shortly two years ago as an extension of their home estate.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and an increase in the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always liked to do things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard drive, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was very brave enough to participate in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, "says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is going to be okay.
Salomon Kol, who grows meat cars, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
Right now, he's competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and for the first time since October last year when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
CPI-measured annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%, compared with June 2016.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016% compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, increases were observed in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport equipment (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that are close to absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple or a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lentils are unembellished, features-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to the attention of the public.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin surfaces as a beauty product.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into crooked, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions refer to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday, including the web publications The Verge and the Mother board the day after Snapchat told us that he had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not to be the caricature of the Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some of them vehemently denied the anime analogy.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet of pictures was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is equated with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not only a "yellowface," but one taken to the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that must avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, ranging from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
The general public in Snapchat is made up of young people who, from an ethnic background, are more diverse than their parents' counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, this type of thing is no longer easily overlooked, as before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Designer on the Medium publication platform, decided to remove his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In his paper and telephone interview in the media, he said that he believed that ethnic contradictions reflected the lack of respect for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company's leadership, mostly male and white, and ended his writing with hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff who can make decisions like this, or they also have colored employees, but their position is not that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily" says the Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff based on its status as a private enterprise.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but its spokesperson said that the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and on promoting participation within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress's expert group, military officials falsified intelligence on Isis.
On Thursday, a report was published by a group of congressional experts saying that the US military officers, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave us cause to understand.
The Republican Chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee set up a working group to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in brief, is a US military headquarters in the State of Florida in Tampa, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of inquiries approved by the senior officials of the Central Com generally gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other units of the intelligence community ', a press release on the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level political decision-makers," says Ken Calvert, Republican representative of California.
"The mistakes at the management level of Centcom extend to the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report gives details of the continuing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by Central Command's descriptions and analyses of the American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by the Obama administration have been falsified, it provides an image of the analysts, which gives the impression that the leaders of the Centre have put pressure on them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were much more positive than what actually happened," says the report.
"For example, a Centrum official made a public statement that a major military assault on Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo, Republican representative of Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders in the United States armed forces manipulated the intelligence results received in order to belittle the threat of Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group after having been informed of the doubts expressed by the analysts that intelligence on Isis had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into the intelligence of Centrom.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Cencom created an excessively limited process to evaluate intelligence on Isis and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the high-ranking Democratic Representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results," violated the morale of analysts' and "fails to take sufficient account of divergent views'.
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to put pressure on the analysts in the centre to adapt its conclusions to the 'predetermined or political official line'.
The daily beach news site told us on Tuesday about the preliminary results of the congressional inquiry.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon's Chief Inspector-General, which was initiated as a result of actions brought by the analysts at Centrom.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his statement that the DOD will not comment on the congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other sequelae, in addition to seeking to ascertain whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (claim from an increasing number of defence authorities).
However, the arguments made last year questioned President Obama's confidence in Central Command and its honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence on the Isis is more than a decade ago in line with the differences that emerged when the Centrom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, published a study according to which the government of President George W. Bush, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only a small number of troops in Iraq and spent little time considering what the consequences of the 2003 invasion would be.
Hooker also played a central role in the uprising against the intelligence concerning Isis.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Working Party concluded that, despite opposing public statements, the air strikes in the refineries controlled by Isis had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside Central Command, reported by The Times in September.
Last year, the then commander of Cencom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's hockey and establish its position in the dispute with Britain
After scoring three goals in a victorious, goal 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure whether he had before succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of the goals they score."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost zero games and will share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued its winning streak on Thursday when it won Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first of the six teams and which will be the second.
First placed to avoid a long-term encounter with the hard-considered Dutch team, who won the second block.
Despite what happens at the game on Saturday, the Americans have already stirred up their surprising success in these races, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and was the first to catch a field hockey bat at the age of 3 (his two sisters played the sport in Drexel). He was the country team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final list of players.
After this came the 2012 race, where he and his team did not see much success.
The following year, the English man Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and then things started to change.
"The change was cultural, spiritual and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace in London was not as it is now.
We've done a full turn. "
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a backhand.
India had come to the game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, wriggling in the middle field, hitting the ball in the goal and thus taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal halfway through the fourth period.
The game was the first tournament in which the US goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal was sunk in each one of the hits.
Briggs is now living on his success cycle.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympiahulina trampoline brings zen
Whatever the place or the time, the Olympics are bound to collide.
Events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be following a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic fire itself is a flaming baton which is passed from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You cannot open a television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's this guy named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley is smiling and might well have a name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be favoured by sponsors and would appear on TV ads of a good mind if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for an Olympic ball with a trampoline.
Olympic fire does not shed equal light on all competitions.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are less known sports such as aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest article about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the Sydney Games in 2000, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be area-specific.
Although athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never made it to the medals and has never made it to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the women's side the Canadians have been chained to the medals.
China's Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, trampoline has the charm of underdog, partly because it sounds more appropriate to an uncivilized ear than to an Olympic circus school.
(In this context, I confess that I am not an expert, just a common fan.)
The species has its comical potential, which has been used in drawing images in endless bouncing scenes of characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jump, i.e. species that are essentially combined in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "springboard."
The ambitious masters will jump on a huge trampoline that will hurl them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers will have to make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time."
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries are competing for the Championships of trampoline gymnastics, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field while seeking gold.
In addition to the finish line or the departure wall, they also have a second objective, which they are pursuing in televised reports, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical, and it's even enough to make a watcher cry.
But I also find this a little exhausting just to watch the games.
This is where the trampoline offers respiration.
In the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up like an astronaut, falls down and hurls back up without a hitch.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a ferocious rush to the finish line or jumping far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as an Olympic race can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and men's similar competitions on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will start on either day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the midst of Olympia, they bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that could be overlooked in the midst of a common hoodlum.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering men-to-be-looking surfers and objectifying them - as the American male gymnast Wall Street Journal recently suggested - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his agitated new band of fans.
An entire generation protest in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The government's forces have violently disbanded demonstrations that call for political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protestors have been shot to death in a series of attacks with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable West ally with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations which are spreading to increasingly large areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was relentless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protestors.
The videos of the demonstrations, probably at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security forces are beating young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer now calls for an in-depth investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa.
The population of Ethiopia after Nigeria is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The US military and intelligence are very supportive of the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, will receive this much aid from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from a model country for democracy: human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the repressive policy of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation could be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and have no choice but to show their minds, they will burst out," says Seyoum Teshomme, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All the young people are showing their minds.
A whole generation protesting. "
There are many reasons for dissatisfaction, ranging from the use of land to the strangulation hold of the coalition government.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place previously belonging to the opposition, which is why they now dominate the whole of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the Eritrea border, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the fight in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons why the bitterness that has been ploughed under the surface for years is unraveling right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and Internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people have access to the Internet via proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many young people in Ethiopia told us that this is how they called people to demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Orons and Amharas.
Oroms and Amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas, mainly from the Christian Highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the politics and business of the country and exploited the Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest demonstrations have just taken place in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromas feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population and nevertheless controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unmentioned disease in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly skilled in identifying the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled the differences between the counterparties.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says Conflict Investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' boots for almost unknown reasons.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no trust in the security forces administered by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this means more bloodshed.
For the last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which, according to the analysts, were first screwed up and then stolen by the government.
In post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the Ethiopian leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment of the Ethiopian Government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And the resentment is about to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the city of Amhara, Gondari, protesters attacked companies owned by the tigres, and anti-tigres hate speech is becoming more common in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
Ethiopia has been used by the US Government as a base for unmanned aircraft surveyed by neighbouring Somalia, but according to the US, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires a firm balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of the Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull back his words in the latest dispute over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious on several occasions this week when he claimed President Obama and Hillary Clinton as the 'founders' of the terrorist group Isis.
Clarification raised new questions about the Republican side of the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly with the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he perhaps did not mean.
Trump made an argument at the election on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump made a full speech on the tweet from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he had been quite serious about his accusations.
When the radio host and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest review yrsky rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the numbers fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
On Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump will stretch the boundaries of political speech and withdraw its words if necessary.
"I believe it is his way of testing certain messages that give rise to a response from his supporters. He looks at how the supporters react to the messages, and" clarify "then in one way or another depending on the reactions," says Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to penetrate different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral public, Trump has, in recent days, turned his style even more pungent as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristi, published on Friday, reported that Trump's support was significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the last few months of his presidential campaign, the jokes of Trump have placed his loyal supporters in an awkward position, in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, however provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, strongly defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a well-founded political speech," answered Giuliani when he was asked whether Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization which Obama incorrectly called the" lower-class team "and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama regime, in which Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to continue its efforts when it failed to take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of insubordination and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "worthless and pathetic" television commentators who were trying to find out about him, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some democrats made fun of Trump's explanation and said it was only more clear that he was not fit for President.
Due to the rise in unaffordable rent, the coffee shop opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a raggedy cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its street-side seat on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose to an unreasonable level.
Soap Cherie, who came to replace Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The local people find this loss of a coffee shop that has been avoided under the middle class to be deplorable.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club no longer exists, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, they're also creating new ones.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a few miles north of its original location.
The new verb café has Wi-Fi and can be paid by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also reactivated even old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says that he also wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese-sandwich and filling with capers and brownish onion rings.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
No more beer from the coffee shop, but instead of juice made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of holding the café, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers started going to Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited a coffee shop recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb on a regular basis.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took his usual iced coffee instead of a chai tea mix, which is also a new item on the list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully from 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work, and he ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into a coffee shop every day at 7: 15, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butter bagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he changes the baggel of bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez says there's no hard feelings that the soap store took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is manufactured by Verb's own cold-breasted coffee.
"We may yet take up the offer," says Rodriguez.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee shop's cold-breasted coffee.
The café may also expand to the next building.
However, it is enough for many customers to have their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, "says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The sad food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary aristocracy, was fond of luxurious food from the restaurants on Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and the Maryland tortoise soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity in agreeing to meet with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the major stock market crash took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meatloaf, the couple said it would be suitable for a discussion about eating a major recession.
"The mugs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They were made of ingredients that were cheap and plentiful.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they'll be enough for the whole meal. "
Andrew Coe makes a mockery.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table especially in the countryside operated on the buffet principle "eat as much as you want."
Women made food for farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly baked pies were served.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the way the people survived when there was suddenly a need to give up their abundance.
"This was the time when food became a central and distressing topic for the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as meatloaf and casserole foods became the main food, and the casserole dishes were called a "great way to exploit the food residues" because the chefs could have covered up the unattractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the central part of the American meal for years, became sparingly used luxury.
They tried strange mixes where the most important thing was the fulfilment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
When doing a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage-time dish.
"It did not get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion onion don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes. "
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, directed the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be specific budget managers and to meet the challenge of making larvae like carrot cream spaghetti into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical flavors.
Especially tasty are the reports of the reactions of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's' let me eat cake 'attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman, who he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He almost ate in a golden dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality. "
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the food served at the White House was not only the most boring but also the worst prepared in Washington. "
Many of the food in the recession was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When they write the book, the couple say that they have started to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she couldn't throw food away.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once upon a time..."
After the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out the plum dessert they made at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It is called plum foam," says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sunk our spoon into a thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did the second time and the third time.
"Walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation to Gilead for legal fees for the patent dispute with Merck on the anti-hepatitis C drug
The judge of the US Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it incurred for a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was released in June from the damages of $200 million imposed on him for the violation of two Merck-owned patents in relation to the success medicines known as Sovaldi and Harvoni in Gilead. An American judge found that Merck committed offences involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, the judge of the US Regional Court, Beth Labson Freeman, says that Gilead was entitled to the exemption from the legal fees which it incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to reach Gilead, which controls the market with new generation of anti-hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded that sofosbuvir, which is under laboratory work, be privately owned. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead medicines.
The city of Manbiji has been taken over by US-backed troops from the Isis.
The forces supported by the United States have taken over the town of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, when the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, says the spokesman for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
A representative of the military council in Manbiji, a member of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages captured by Isis' fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely in our possession, but we are still running search and rescue operations," said Darwish.
The Clinton people earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax.
On Friday, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return, showing that his and his husband's income at that time was USD 10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clinton Group donated a million dollars to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's book on his term of office at the State Department.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced 10 years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to serve as a model for financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri.
The exact opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
According to the custom, the US presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax board to review it and call it the reason why Trump hasn't released his income information.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted by Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams referring to the tax information of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special lawyer, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax information until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity capital, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and published on Friday an online video showing prominent Republicans who are forcing Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Mr Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business column quoted on Friday several tax lawyers and auditors that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential elections.
According to Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, Clinton, has supported a rule that would ensure that more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax information.
Buffet says that he too has been audited by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, who now live in the city of Chappaqua in the state of New York, paid a real federal tax on average of 32% between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton Group reported the sum of dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Fillet condoms filled with chili powder to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Protectors in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements - elephants are thrown at them by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has, together with the American organisation Nature Conservation, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to haunt elephants.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Having developed the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as the villagers can now rely on their ability to keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguard Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is disturbed by pointing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this does not work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The chilli powder mixed in the soil is placed in the condom together with the firecracker, and the end of the condom is twisted closed so that only the fuse is left out.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chilli powder cloud into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a thrower that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker criticises the Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli area number from the Arab "invitation" - RT News
A French film director with a Jewish roots gave birth to a media boat after discovering that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention the area number of Israel on its land number list. The hotel worker appealed to the "invitations" from Arab customers when asked.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, disillusioned the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of area numbers offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was completely destroyed - as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that he was shocked by the receptionist's response.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the procedure further shocked the film director.
According to Mr Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the area code of Israel."
The Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said "a great disgrace."
"The case is shocking and upsetting to all of us.
It's a great shame.
And it is all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and it is precisely this chain of hotels.
That's all the explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a resistance in the network, where it was called a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply gave in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a publication which highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski's representative.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets at the Brazilian students' demonstration.
The students joined forces with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot started when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration who wanted to express their dismay at the plans of the government.
The Governor of the Land of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has put forward a proposal for a savings measure, which will close down nearly 100 public schools and invest 300 000 students in new schools.
Some protestors graffiti the walls, which were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, the President's office.
The protest of the students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protests in favour of the disgraced President, Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate of the country voted on the impediment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% - RT business
Since the lifting of the sanctions, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, "says Levan Dzhagarya, Ambassador of Russia to Iran.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies will be ready to enter the market.
The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cross-border cooperation, "says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased rapidly by 91.5% to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
Trade was driven by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects that a record number of Iranian tourists will travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries whose citizens were travelling in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year, "he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner scored while the British won cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner was reputed by the men's team print at the Rio velodrom last night, when the British Triangle defended the 2012 World Cup in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow was in the anchor role he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud as he raced to the finish line and captured the victory of the team of New Zealand, which was considered to be an advance favourite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic games.
And they repeated the trick after they were only six in the World Championships for track cycling in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialises in the role of first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to end his career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man that British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
With Hindes, Hoy, Kenny and Skinner won the championship four years ago, made the Olympic record in time-driving, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British Triangle won gold in a duel.
Hindes was a little behind in his rounds, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy in such a way that Hindes drove the speed down with a higher gear, which enabled Kenny, and particularly Skinner, to keep it going.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eyes as they entered the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I am flattered by the parable.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it. "
After winning London 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he fell on the track on purpose because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the British rivals did not have a way of complaining.
This time, there were no problems of this kind associated with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The atmosphere was as it was in London, all the British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team was united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory in the Olympics feels great. "
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railway championships both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, we are facing the most successful five days with a velodrom.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold in one of the Olympics.
This would mean the accumulation of an account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
This would have the same medal achievements as Hoy's.
Kenny's next to compete in a sprint that starts today and solves in three days.
Kenny, 28-year-old Bolton, says, "At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team competition is always the best.
You and your friends will enjoy winning together.
Winning alone is a little lonely. "
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the knight's rank."
This was the only medal race today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doulle were the fastest in a four-man team chase.
Their time was 3: 51.943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and final (22.42 p.m.) will be in competition today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition agents before the time drive, when they invited him to measure his height.
In a similar race for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald, from Milngavie, reached the world record 4: 13.260.
The British team can now count on its great track cycling team to take over the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations prior to Rio have been underestimated.
The background has been drama, the least of which is the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of allegations of sexuality and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions on the first evening of the velodrom show that Britain's already legendary reputation will be brought to the top at the perfect moment once again.
The future of the Portland smelting plant is at stake as a result of the end of the electricity contract.
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland in the state of Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers, are at stake when the power company operating electricity in the melting plant said that one of the owners of the plant is about to dismantle the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victoria Government earlier this year not to continue the aid to keep the plant in operation.
A fixed aid of 20 years will expire in November.
As many as 2000 jobs are at risk from the Alcoa Portland factory.
As a result of the closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland melting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
These measures are in line with the speculation on the future of the plant which has been going on for years, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of production.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects three other smelters to terminate their contracts as well.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority interests in the factory.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL reports that the agreements are so-called hedging agreements which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already says that it has reduced the value of the contracts by USD 187 million in its accounting system "in anticipation of the termination of the contracts."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's... capacity to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant."
The American company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the poor economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious in their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland in the state of Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
In his speech to the analysts earlier this week, the operational director of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, explained that, on an annual basis, Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
"If these plants exit the market, this will mean a significant fall in demand (electricity) on the market.
For us, as a producer, that would not be good news, "says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian true television star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris Kendall Jenner, 20, posing in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, an advertising face of Estee Lauder and performing at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps just the Kardashian style?), a written video showing all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar crew Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite, the Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest) showing that they forgot their sister's cover picture. The video ends in a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché and used in almost all the birthday episodes of the asterisk programs (Seacrest says: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
For appearing in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's big sister Kim could have reached Vogue's claim before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite different.
September issue is Vogue's most sold release in the year.
A number resembling a larger picture book than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site from Fashion calculated that last year's 832-page wood had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September coverage star is expected with such fervour that, in the last two years, the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Earlier in September, cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities on the cover who work as models rather than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and the Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and one year later, Lady Gaga got the credit.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is more of a model-working celebrity, he is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
You can rightly call them talented women who prosper in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year, Beyonce, who appeared in the cover photo, has one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of its reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches."
These feelings have been stirred up again since the news of Jenner appearing on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the constant indignation of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks around in Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
He's the face of the Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through pay-per-view applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he filmed in LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he's on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, the most vulnerable people in over 160 000 countries are turned away from the legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the effects that further cuts in the budget will have on centres already operating at extreme borders.
In the state of Queensland, three of those seeking free legal assistance and legal assistance are already being turned away from five people - the majority of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public assistance services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Since June next year, there is a risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Public Legal Assistance Centre in Queensland, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not faint its decision, Farrell says that the situation will only get worse.
"The public legal aid centres in Queensland are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they seek the essential services they need," says Farrell.
"People who leave violent relationships, people who are under an uncontrolled and crippling debt burden, families who are getting divorced, workers who are unfairly made redundant - all have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to stop these financial cuts immediately so that people can receive the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the Land Government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of the public legal aid centres and their customer communities, and the Palazzczuk Government must invest in this important work. "
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: A complaint was brought against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was likely to be taken after its leadership had been informed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened the worker with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
My Bordini says that he has been waiting for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he, according to his own words, understood that this is not going to happen.
My Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "pulled out the pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, after lodging a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini was informed that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini in her lawsuit.
The suit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the Second Amendment - considered to be gun-owners and arms-takers - can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media took his words out of context, and Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation for the indifferent conduct of the campaign and for Phillip for the assault, assault and psychological suffering caused by it.
The Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to the message asking for comments.
No one could reach Phillip, despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB told me Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call from the Phillip consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case-law: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Supreme Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also revive the economy and create prosperity, not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was a matter of greatest interest in Heathrow, and as we did at the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge effort to ensure that all of our nations and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, thus eliminating youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who believe that the extension of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
This extension is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force at Heathrow which has implemented a GBP 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in the budget, including the T5 terminal - which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years - and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that this will also be the extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the extension of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow's board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a cat-mouse game
The efforts of companies that earn their money from online advertising to mislead advertising software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own website that it would block advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it told that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes on its desktop website so that advertising tensioners will find it more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock is telling us that he has discovered the new codes.
Adblock's spokesman, Ben Williams, wrote in his blog that "this kind of spin between the open source advertising community and the decoys has been going on since the ad tensioners were invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be doing its own repair business again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertising operators have become in the sector.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people are using advertising tenets programmes, as reported by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising tensioners in its desktop application, as the publicist says that mobile advertising blocking programs do not work in Facebook mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from the Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that they are updating the user settings advertising tool so that users can control how advertisements are directed to them more effectively.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters as they also prevent the appearance of some ordinary Facebook writings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook spokesman in his email release.
"The TV programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving her car under a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of witnesses on the freeway during the first hours of Thursday when a woman deliberately left several cars behind.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the Canton of Vaudi near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate deed by lying down on a dark road, and she was hit by several cars, says Vaudi police in her press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was clearly trying to commit suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneva that criminal investigations have been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether there are any charges brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to determine, "says Hofstetter.
There have been two similar cases over the last five years which do not hold drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on a dark motorway and the court decided that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges brought against him for manslaughter following his encounter with a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one August night in 2014.
The court found out that a 22-year-old victim had been drinking a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the conduct of a police officer - who was responding to a distress call - was justified and the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Anyone who knows anything about the accident that occurred on Thursday near Morges is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus's past using the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions of Venus could sometimes be similar to those of the Earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous on its surface and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to earlier presentations by scientists, the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the Earth and has nevertheless been slowly rotating.
The model was also used to determine the early topography of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus revolves slowly and has a daily side per sun for almost two months at a time," says Anthony Del Genio, GISS researcher in the press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface for a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the vaporised water.
With hydrogen's karate, all that was left in space was a thick carbon-carbon atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect - i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy renounces his position as coach of Avalanche.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his duties as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey activities, arguing for a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Vice President / CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as Deputy Director General of the club's hockey activities energetically, passionately and decisively," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"During the summer, I have long and hard thought about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and club's hockey director must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met. "
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his commitment to the team.
"Patrick told me today of his decision," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league year for his first season as head coach of Avalanche in 2013-2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the extension period in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in 2015-2016 and was five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing for another Wild Card place at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two in Montreal Canadiens ranks and two in Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and break the strike
The main negotiators report that wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has had strikes on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties "Wood Group and Trade Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute '.
From the beginning of next week we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, in which we will be dealing with the problems with recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which, according to them, were the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group will cut tariffs for its contractors in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working on land in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the room for manoeuvre needed to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has lost thousands of employees and announced its plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to improve its operations after its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the British decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Earlier this week, Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the Labour Directors to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that have been experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need an economy that benefits many people and not just a few," says Anderson.
The new North Sea projects are expected to spend less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, compared to some USD 7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejade constellation.
The latest task of the Kepler space telescope has been to measure the rate of rotation of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speed of rotation of the stars of the Plejades.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why the stars of the same constellation rotate at different speeds and how rotation times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star forces, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age and even about the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Plejad constellation is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars of the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just about reaching their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever right now.
With the speed of rotation at its peak, large amounts of star wind are released from the growing stars.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they advance through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of recognisable star spots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers... the bigger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the" dance "of the Plejads that the slow ones are typically larger, while the fastest ones are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejads are so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Plejad constellation offers a pillar of support for theoretical models for the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to know a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and end their "dance."
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of Plejade rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
