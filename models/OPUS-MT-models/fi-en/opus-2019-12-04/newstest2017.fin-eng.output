A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local mall stairwell this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says: "His affairs were finally going well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancis Frank Galicia, the San Francisco coroner's office was said to be.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a homicide and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a line chef in Boston, had had his dream job as a line chef at the Sanfrancisco's Sons & Dauphters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Dauphers said that they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missed very much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the beginning of the hostels, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well."
"He found an apartment and went out with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent, and he had a great heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make dinner, "Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted along with the flow.
"In a world in which so many things are wrong, he was a diamond without grinding, which shined brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade unions to adopt new industrial action measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the Council as a whole to support new industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address their concerns regarding the agreement.
In July, doctors' trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the Members who voted.
On Thursday evening, in a letter to Members via Twitter, Mr Ellen McCourt, President of the JDC, said that the government had remained "persistently silent" on the issues which, he said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement in full and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request to the BMA Council for a special meeting in order to obtain a mandate for a gradual and expanding industrial action programme starting early in September.
As a result of the dispute, doctors' trainees have taken part in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The Director of BMA's Medical Trainees, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the rejection of the terms recommended by the BMA in the vote.
He had told the members of the BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors' trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
A life that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands with each other and to declare the fight for eight months of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the palace of St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that Ankara wanted more than this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands at the ceremony.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he didn't say much about heat, even according to his own subdued standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke about his "dear friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better ones.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as having behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness that radiated Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an assumed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild real confidence.
The public opinion of Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led to an astonishing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories dominated by Isis.
He has expressly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to a strict truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown by last month's failed coup d'état.
He has also clearly been shaken by the continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
In addition, there is a financial motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, in particular the ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by nearly 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved by the fact that flights will eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season run into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But there was also political added value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
With the long-standing resentment of the snail's advanced EU membership negotiations, Mr Putin, who is keen to exploit coolness and crush Turkey's ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader was certainly given points off from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a breakthrough for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the flashy seaside palace enabled the 'outside coalition' presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described to me: two countries that feel that the West abandoned them and treated them wrongly, joining forces.
These two, however, have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of the peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It may be a lot of talk that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering their differences in relation to the question, while Mr Putin chose to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter plane, it is certainly better that two leaders should be on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up these objectives.
The Bank's strategies have now used the "RBS" brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sport, from the Six Nations rugby to the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in operation with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted again.
In England and Wales, all RBS references with the exception of the main office and stock exchanges will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will be our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we will now become much more a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has increased the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we have been asking) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3,000.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory, he has a total of 3,000 wins.
Frankie Dettori, the racer, confirmed his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone of his second victory on his home track as he competed with John Gosden at Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time master jockey dettori, who won earlier at Ghayyr, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here, too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The Dettori absorbs cheers when he leads Predilection forward after victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in the obstacle contests - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Pigget, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins.
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical intelligence separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been dragging fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey at the big races!
Seriously, Frankie has ridden the winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a vibrant person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a drone landing from the saddle.
From flying stops to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A series of wins in big races, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed considerable character in challenging the sceptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has said before that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin is separated by Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement stated that Mr Putin had "ordered Ivanov to leave the office of President of the Russian presidential regime ', but that there was no reason for him to do so.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
The deceased, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence."
In my opinion, the most important task for the administration is to support your activities as head of state with regard to the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Mr Vaino be replaced.
Are those smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a security service for the Soviet Union in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a public television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some sort of aftermath of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official argument that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complicated task for four years, I wish I could even say working.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months. "
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second term of Mr Putin, because Mr Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another ally close to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Criminals star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the series set in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and a fight at the scene.
I regret that it happened, "he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how to remove Gibson's character from the FBI team series are expected later.
Previously, the 54-year-old who starred the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminals series, and I have given it all I can for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series is scheduled for 28 September.
The mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
The man who lives in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by a vortex of water.
Bain, which lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the revelation in Periscope hoping that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the northern deck of Queensferry's overpass with the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four brackets between the "chicken threats" which are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 braces.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's overpass.
We are all witnessing very impressive engineering work on this project, which has used more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section. "
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the barrier between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precision measures must be matched.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck will be cast in Rosyth today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised to its seat on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first closure of any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this shutout represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last section of the road deck was installed and combined with the expanding north pillar road cover, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is to say inland, side.
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the land bridge of the northern fairway.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge because the soil is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled around 3% at the slope angle.
Complicated, because the permitted measurement deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Salvation on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" since they fell off their fishing boat outside Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNL rescue boat station made an alert at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperate to swim to safety while their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw a boat circling closer to men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helmsman of the Moelfren lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got there," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a kill switch rope in the boat's engine, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable health and happiness hunt
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out and play, but rather spend their leisure time watching displays.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some kind of action.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games and now recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s in video games (later they gave rise to a series of drawings, playing cards and other extension products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the publication of the game in other countries was delayed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be "photographed" (using phone screen capture) or "caught" after discovery.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the craze and jumped out of the couch with the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person."
The Apple Watch application, which follows 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the publication of the game, the number of people moving from 45% to 53% of the users followed by the cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
Many public health campaigns' find 30 ',' get off the couch 'and' not active every day 'have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and caring people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of getting cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they're hunting.
As usual, disgraced party poachers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new charm disappears and the use wears off in due course.
However, because of the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with real world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's gymnastics multi-match.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
I can't believe it on the ass.
It's great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles balance lines for women's gymnastics multi-match at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to have won the multi-match championship in a row, and the fifth American champion in all, and at the same time he strengthened his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps all-time.
He broke into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement raises him to the same class as other of his generation's best athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
For the past three years, Biles has been in control of his species, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold, with programs whose mixture of ambition and precision has been so astonishing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Going back to the family home in Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles in the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the Golden and Silver Medal (in this order) women's gymnastics multi-match at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination of the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyin.
Although Mr Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes the volt bypass of his trademark - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as toddler by her grandparents, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force factor.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak should go on for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance beam and the permanto, where Biles is the dominant world champion, were waiting.
He got to the top with the boom points 15.433 and crossed them by getting 15.933 on the perm.
Raisman hugged him kindly as they waited for the credits - a mere formality - and tears rose to the glitter-red, white and blue eyes of Biles when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the public after his performance as a perm in emotional turmoil about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting from this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot in a serial murder while listening to music in a car
The two women who died in the most deadly attack on Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the driveway on June 12.
It is reported that the shooter standing on the passenger's side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled with another means of transport.
According to the police, the triple homicide didn't seem to have been the result of the robbery because the assailant didn't take the handbags or the $2900 he had on another adult victim.
A representative of the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was connected to the four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks in four months, which have been committed in two mainly Latin American districts.
"These happen in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
Suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including Nissan, brown in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police release on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple murder, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have also been the work of a serial killer.
Forensics found bullet casings, bullet casings in the seat, bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike a large number of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, and this is the result of a genetic disorder which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not at all true - of course I promised, "he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking stand.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
Plus, he loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund invented the sign for "sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own signposts.
Microcephalus may be caused by a variety of causes: genetic infections such as Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hope-rich advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You have to believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi.
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reported that many rivers in southeast Louisiana and the Southern Mississippi overflowed and caused a large flood due to extreme rainfall.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are in constant contact with the local authorities and that help is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele from the governor's security and emergency office said they were getting requests for high water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipavia County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in the statement that a further 3 to 5 cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a peak flood record during the weekend.
The wearer Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding of Ascension County along the river, as the flooded rivers slowly land in Lake Maurepas.
On the south side of the border of the State of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool in Louisiana was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The Saviors are still picking up people from flood water in Amita and Wilkinson County, southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were close to Gloster on Friday among the survivors.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally more than 400 feet away from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family all had injuries, and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the trio in a big military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Mr Krautmann says that floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rain continues and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated by the heavy rain that has been going on since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, as reported by the authorities.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipao said that 200 homes were flooded.
The population had been evacuated to two churches, but both of them are now flooded.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that 72 people and 7 pets were rescued by the authorities who had been surrounded by high tide.
In the cities of Amita and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipaala, about 20 streets were closed due to rising water, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said the city's administrative authority Lacy Landrum.
This is about to turn into a case like this.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the emergency manager of Harrison County, said that the steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far on Friday no cases of flooding have been reported.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amita, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, "full of bullets," survived the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in town this week.
The baby's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown got multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he's had several surgeries.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The kid was starting first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were at steady state according to CBS Philadelphia.
A child was found shot in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reported by the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men might be the shooter.
Scientists are telling CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The shell types of the assault weapon, which originated from various weapons of attack, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," Anthony Ginaldi, Philly Police Commissioner, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are checking surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, got hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman to have won individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And team mate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but this is not what it looks like in gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went along the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (last five), because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnastics players, and this is Marta Karolyin's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (coaches and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnalists get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must bring cheaper and accessible gymnastics training to communities where numerous young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, live.
I started my gymnastics department 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (mainly black and Latin) and we have prepared national and international champions.
In September, we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
The gymnast develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing a serious "girl strength" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young femininity.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was on "unknown territory" and that even minor additional delays would damage staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new agreement that includes changes to the night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said last night in a statement: "Medical Trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis, and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a lack of willingness on the part of the government to participate and sometimes a deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he doesn't do that, medical trainees will be ready to continue their work-fighting activities.
The latest strike at the end of April meant almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, while nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants better weekend pay for 54 000 doctors under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers' Association, appealed to doctors' trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Labour battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a difficult situation and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - would show how serious employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine that pays £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are on the verge of benefiting from a two-pound daily medicine after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
Anti-clotting medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS's supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fat in the artery wall, which forms a stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If a clot breaks out, it can travel along with the blood and cut off the blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a company in Great Britain and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft guidance document for NICE published today recommends the administration of 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
The fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to add available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance document does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread rejection of voting fraud in Muslim communities being revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former Minister of Government, Sir Eric Pickles, shouts the police, electoral officers and city councils that they have ignored evidence of electoral fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity."
The former Secretary of the Community, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so serious that the police should be allowed to set up security chains to protect voters who were frightened outside the polling stations.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when they vote to prove who they are.
Nowadays, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes to put an indelible ink on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistle-blowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and financial fraud, which goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "cyically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islam.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting with someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the vote on election fraud by post, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a number of recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the identification with an identity card.
He says in his report: 'Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh backgrounds.
"Concerns were expressed that... government institutions had ignored such behaviour due to" politically correct "racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals for the system to be cleaned up, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with the ballot box issued by post in order to put an end to 'collecting votes'.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for stricter checks on registered persons in order to prevent the use of an electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options for proving the identity of the voters before voting.
Use the invincible ink on the person who votes so that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting via mail.
Prevent political activists from handling the ready-made sounds and envelopes in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set up security chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling stations.
Require that only English (except in Wales) be used in polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that staff stick to the rule that voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is going to kill the Great London police force saying it's "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The Electoral Court will remain as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty without suspicion on the basis of numerous grounds, according to the threshold of forensic evidence.
He also criticised the ineffective "tick-in-the-box checks" in the municipal council voting register offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation. "
Crazy for Kate's bike double and other celebrity photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been confused by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous double - at least according to the social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: member of the US men archery team Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, many people online have been quick to notice how a certain archer could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the US men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures came up, where he looks like he's scared like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that since he was a child he had heard that he looked like Leo.
"Personally, I don't see a great resemblance, except maybe with the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons of London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the startling resemblance between British height jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, obvious eyes, has been said to be the double of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor.
Another long-term comparison has been between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who both have the same strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the tanned skin and blond hair of the actor Annalyne McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sporty version."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, sharing the same face and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presenting theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the football star in the United States and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic Commentator makes an apology for saying that a Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth message of women's 4x200 metres of freedom, instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan, was infuriating on Wednesday to the viewers of the CBC's direct Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female officer "lost like a bad smell 'and" dead as a pig'.
Briefer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 metres freestyle messaging finals.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC briefing team to bring a "color," they heard him say, "That little 14-year-old from China blew it, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that. "
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC spokesman just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer" died like a pig? "?
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air. "
The Chinese Ai Yanhan was filmed in the 4 x 200 metre message finals of women's freestyle: "That little 14-year-old from China was a mess, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was loud and fast, when many challenged him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves back when they found out how indifferent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a bunch of racist people.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC broadcast, apologized to MacDonald's comment on the broadcast, saying: "We regret that the comment on swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened. "
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
On behalf of Mr MacDonald, the rapporteur, Mr Scott Russell, had to apologize.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and were sent live.
Last night, we took rapid action and, on a live broadcast, we apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Mr Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Mr MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to define his comment by saying that he did not mean it as a personal attack to be interpreted.
"I would like to apologise at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said on the CBC Olympic mission.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not as a person."
"Needless to say, I didn't mean it disrespectful, and I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was appalled by a woman who bravely suited underwear in the middle of the store.
Clients didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes off in the middle of Primark's shop to try out her underpants.
Things didn't get better because, after assessing what she looked like in her pants, the woman would peel them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually arranged four pairs of underpants at the bouverie Place shopping center in Folkänne.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkenne, where the woman was fitting underwear and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two at the store, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again and walked away from the shop without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman was standing in the middle of the floor of the store, taking a pair of panties on display, taking off her own pantyhose and underwear and putting on her matching feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for reconciliation, he just stood there unshamelessly."
"Everyone stared at him while he took his underwear off and clearly didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf."
He did the same thing for three more couples before finally deciding he didn't like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in the city of Kent, said: "It is disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried, but has not been cleaned."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I understood that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing items from the sale after the woman left, which is all right."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they haven't been washed."
The representative of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's shop on Tuesday, 9 August.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn from sale. '
This allows you to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the great champion Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the groin; and when the attacker goes into the curvature of pain, twist the gun from his hand, and strike him in the back of the gun, and back off with the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so the criminal can't fire.
At the same time, place weight on the gun and hit the assailant in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound awkward?
Look at the video and see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places for a tour guide
The British traveller has put his immune system and vomit reflex under serious challenge by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The host from Suffolk and traveller Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknote, the railing in Piccadilly Circus, the flush button on the train's toilet and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before he licked every target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made with a film called "Inner Power," produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the sink in the kitchen.
On his way across Europe, Wright constantly talked to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him anything else in the mouth of a bad taste.
Wright became known as the endurance tester of his bowels while travelling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
This task, which extends from public rail station rails to toilet seat flush button, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film that was made, he said: "Since I was a child, I have been quite carefree about my health, and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth from soil, worms and mud water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained a photometric reading of over 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should read below 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed over 4000 units, and the newly washed hands are less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist's film, Inner Power, along with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's disgusting in here.
After internal power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefile, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to improve the efficiency of human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Valio snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the probiotics' interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'.
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we can find an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say it like this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the porky Russian latrine in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things that were licked were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded. "
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% said that at least occasionally they use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The Berk family destroyed the rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted.
After being evicted due to the terrorist activity of the neighbours, the Berk family caused damage to their rental house of £50,000.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash in Cornwall after several complaints had been filed against them.
When they had been removed by force from the property, the shocked housing company employees found the property in poor condition.
The walls had been made with spilling holes, the floorboards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been soaked with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the property couldn't be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here because this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous. "
The couple had three sons who lived in real estate at times, and according to the police, the family tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the demolition threat found old waste.
The floorboards of a property from which drugs were previously delivered had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and the police called regularly.
By force, Cornwall Housing evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to change voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors praised the eviction saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen a police officer here on an incredibly many occasions.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone. "
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall House, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were invited to the property often.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and for the behaviour of his family, as eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall House.
This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police and the courageous members of the community who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in real estate at different times, but they were all in twenty.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding
The housing company's employees need to clean up the garbage piles around the house now.
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis as well as a scale, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting to possession of a B-class drug as an intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are homeless after being left behind in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house had been squashed graffiti.
The police say they're trying to evict residents who make fun of the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to the other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their behaviour is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behaviour," he said.

Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew along the beach at a low altitude.
Sunshine tourists in Portugal in Aveiro experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft swept by very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, the terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came near contact distance from the sun worshippers on the sand strip in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of a dramatic pass on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice at a really low level, and at one point it seemed that it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats close to the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the poor visibility caused by the smoke of nearby fires, but the air force assured that no one was in danger of safety.
The fires this summer have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low-visibility conditions, smoke caused by fires and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected
In January-June, the Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksete) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
The result of the exodus was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
Eksete is trying to shorten the waiting list this year.
The exote covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government of Exote will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border Rangers took a military oath in Imbola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military jury for the officers of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Imbola on Friday.
The jury of the 10th Special Border Jäger Course was held on the garrison's sports field.
A military oath was taken by 70 armed men.
Special Border Jacks are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied to be a special-border ice ranger.
They were invited to the selection tests for 250 of them.
Since 2007, special border jammers have been trained in Imbola.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in a veteran meeting at the grand jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
- Criminal investigation helps solve crime and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has operated as an RTA or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The unit's operation is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being pulled by a sergeant placed in the Bay.
Chief Executive Officer, Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, "says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various types of investigation for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information on asylum seekers.
Modernisation of the most recent working methods
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police would not go anywhere until they got the alert.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will be used to target daily police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in the country.
In Vantaa, the PTR centre, in connection with the Central Criminal Police, is the national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, for their part, work in areas shared by the police services and are responsible for providing information to both the local police and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA is to know what is going on in the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA have computer skills better than the basic police.
With the help of registers, the alert function database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called "sequencing," and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Well, according to the M.O., the unsub is a certain kind of image.
Compilation can be done either by method or by person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
Neither own nor criminal methods are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thereby trying to prevent police crime-fighting attempts.
The police will report on the methods in public if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, in early summer, such a case was reported by the way in which empty dwellings were recorded during break-ins.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the outside door of the apartment to see if the residents were really on the road.
The evidence submitted shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has discovered that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverest will order the minutes of the district court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found.
Next time, we go to the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, an interview has been conducted with Deputy Chief of Police, Tero Seppälä, Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola, Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi, Joensuu Police Station, and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela, Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage reform of the PISA, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects data from outside the boundaries of your own institution and Finland.
A school girl from London who was killed in Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, has been reported dead in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard her death in the Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
The ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape the war-torn land and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a testament to others that there are real risks - that it could make people give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Oriental schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton thinks Garland is the Supreme Court candidate if he's elected.
The President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation ever since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
President Mitch McConnell, head of the Senate majority, says the next president will elect the person to replace Anton Scalia, the late Supreme Court member.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he was predicting "with some certainty" Clinton's choosing Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He said that the Clinton team didn't want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who oppose the appointment of Garland are "henchmen" and "facilitators" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is "for women as well as men."
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The President of the Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his newspaper with a lot of nude pictures is different from the Playboy in the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them, too.
"We must begin again to present timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in the press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the commentary section with irritated insults, written by the initialEAll UnitedMiddle Age Men, you will find that this claim is based on actual data.
According to Yougov, the much-talked-about reappearance of the records is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the middle-life yawn.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl disc are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of all are those in the 18-24 age group who buy records.
It is also not just a question of collecting hobbyists, but also of emotional importance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of Yougov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign with great vigour before I stopped, I would form a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it more carefully."
Let's take a closer look.
At the same time as Soho's charm and dirt is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies stores are now filling the buildings where there were previously independent shops - a handful of great specialised record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty-two), spends the afternoon in London for a meeting, and travels around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover his living room walls.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally published and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Much of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early' 70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I do not smoke or drink much.
This is my vice. "
The 25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets fit the profile of Yougov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and have come to need to buy back their old records.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have generally disposed of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back, "he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakens of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a shop like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for similar-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar disk covers; objects that awaken the memories of teenage happy days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning things creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said suddenly from the disk pile.
The April ICM poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned to be browsing the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of awakening is something that Jonny, who works at the Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), 42, has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said," I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead album so we can put it on the shelf, "he says.
It is not a big deal, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late teens, who are about to get excited.
There is a much more diverse audience when I arrive in the Fopp, which today has almost a whole layer reserved for vinyl.
Seventy-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous movements, the loudspeakers are raging on Wild Beach's freshest sinful and sex-filled pop, and the improvisation jazz is not great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, watching various albums on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record picking is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is... "she sigh in love.
"I don't know how to explain... it's really unique."
It is said that my last stop has awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look at denim shorts, I'm picking up a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before Dad and the daughter are thinking about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
But given that even the slightest attention given to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It will not come as a surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and more money is also the one that spends most on luxury goods, such as vinyl.
But even though my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings lying around the Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy 30-year-old fake TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the furthest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the vault has a longer life span than any other planet's vertebrate.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the request to terminate the trade in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pennies), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's Bureau argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent an untaxed parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the government-sponsored organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting people who run 72 temporary shops, but said that the concern of the Calais Prefect "was entirely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people living in "extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the facilities offered peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of dismantling was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which is non-profit-making and provides 200 meals daily, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9000 people - top reading - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are becoming sharply lower to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price of food in the EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
From the analogue countries only in Britain the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
These data derive from the writing by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010's, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the price level in 1994.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turn, and since then, food has become cheaper every year.
The price is now heavy by the ban on food imports imposed by Russia, which has stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased competition in the prices of industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown to be a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, although food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in the EU countries with a level of wages similar to that of Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly influenced by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the average level of the EU countries and continued to compete in prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
School's not what it used to be.
Returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of the fine print is abandoned, and instead, schools start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social studies start at the fourth grade.
The main change, however, concerns the role of pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebral column was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even the polar shark is known as the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), which only reaches maturity at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reporting a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate species in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic mussel, the oldest known specimen of which is scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland shark is swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the dogs, they can grow up to over 5 meters.
Given the slow rate of growth, according to monitoring only about one centimetre per year, adult individuals have inevitably lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen looked into it.
He defined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carbon timing of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks examined proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 43- and 502-inch Amazonia fins, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
As previous studies have shown that polar sharks only reach maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockman fired nearly 300 people, and they're not going to cut down on the sellers.
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his press release.
According to this, the number of sales agents in department stores is not reduced in order to avoid suffering customer service.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned about 3 000 workers.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background to Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store business profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store trade is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijainen, Stockmann's Acting Managing Director, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," says Veijalainen in the release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was especially due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the corresponding period last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday, it's the rain in the north. It's under 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure centre on top of the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, "says Ilona Láng, HS meteorological specialist.
In the middle of the country, there are also rainbows, but in the south there are coals.
The temperature is no longer very high in summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rainy areas, you stay between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt.
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became clear that Anzrah was a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-meter star Ferguson Rooch.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenyan national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
The doping officers went to report to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because she "committed her crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour, "Kip Keino, President of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, was crushed by the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics will start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is known the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is an advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and they took him to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed, "the source said.
Where is everybody?
The general sports stadium in Rio is gumbling in its emptiness.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching sports.
On Friday in Rio, a battle was launched for the medals of general sport, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show their skills to a disconcerting empty bleachers.
On Friday, Rio's organisers reported that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
There was another one four years ago in London, where the stadium was full of cheering people.
The tickets to the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic audience has attracted attention even before general sport.
For example, there have been thousands of empty seats in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When the Brazilian medallion Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people were only full of about 30% of the stands.
Bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian racing tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for the Brazilian people who are used to football.
Although even the first game of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
The spokesman for the organisers, Mario Andrada, told us this weekend that 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," said Mr Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets from the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though they cost almost half the cost in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 at the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba's sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were a lot of people in the galleries.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, which was established last year, acquires ecological habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities will be able to redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is split into virtual blocks which the interested parties can acquire in exchange for payment of the holder's right.
The holder is entitled to veto his 187 square metre block, which means in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the use of the land is to be changed.
Holders' rights can also be acquired in several sectors.
Acquisition of the right of control is something concrete that can be left to inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature, "explains Juha Levikangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The person who acquired the right of control receives detailed location information from his or her section, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the section.
On the Foundation's website, the list of names of holders of holder rights is displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
The only risk that the Leviathan sees is that the Foundation's activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation will act in some way unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be undisturbed and peaceful.
The foundation acquires land either by buying or by donating.
It finances mainly the sale of the rights of holders, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected land.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The biggest torment of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your hometown
The biggest torment in the big cities of Finland is caused by bicycle thieves.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
The Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police, based on reported bike theft, how much bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year per 1 000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five wheel theft per 1 000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, however, the police were informed of only about two wheel theft per thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, twice the population of the population is affected by thefts compared to others," describes Police Commissioner Tommi Ree.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by the amount of wheels being moved in the city and the amount of wheels at all," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkkää.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board thinks that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are expected to take the lead in comparison.
The number of wheel theft is largely based on what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are separated from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the preferred means of movement," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the number of bike theft recorded by the police in the January to August period has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there's no reason to be happy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20 000 wheel theft every year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 wheels a year.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes because only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to file a crime report for bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten police reported cases will be solved.
The typical bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations, for example in a drug case where stolen bikes can be found in the apartment," says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act or police investigation, "says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are being stolen, for example, from shopping centres' wheelchairs, courtyards, warehouses and wheelbasements, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopas are most often stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up on the market, for example via the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some people might have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or offence.
"The alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear price below cost," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a specialist librarian, always carries his colourful Nopsan for his working day in the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, "says Moose." Never been taken, a good monk has happened. "
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, this does not necessarily have a hipster value," says elk from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to attend a kiosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stuttered against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike to something solid, such as a bike rack.
"A lot of thought will be given to this, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR 500.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, like the" Jopies "kind of thing."
A year ago, a bike was stolen from Valve himself from the house yard.
But the bike was unlocked, so Valve could wait to take it.
Under 15 years of age to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurors from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with the so-called peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to persons under the age of 15 who are now left with no criminal liability.
The peer jury is interfering with the first juvenile crime.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer jury himself in order to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Young man Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"Everyone steers the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young person after his first crime will not be faced with an adult panel, but will reflexes what has happened with approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path you have chosen," says Lovio.
The Peer Jury is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Young People, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need them, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican players want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Mr Rerence Priebus.
The signatories want the party money to be directed to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to democrats in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate allocation of all possible funds to the congressional elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are decreasing every day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he has shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as President.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States.
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the American economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in well-paid jobs after the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that is against workers or wages," said Clinton.
According to the speculation published by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme announced by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for "favouring only millionaires of this kind."
The proposed discount on corporate taxes proposed by Trump has previously been called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of small businesses whose invoices Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton said.
These are Rio ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
In general, sports competitions are shown in television spectator statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympic Games have so far not reached a huge audience.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens at their best: Tuesday evening's swim was followed by 615,000 viewers from the Yle Olympic channel at the same time.
For comparison: the European Championships in general sport one month ago received almost 800,000 viewers at a time to TV2, and the European Football Championships were well worth another million.
So far, the most interesting thing about Olympic sports was cycling on Sunday night and the gymnastics that opened the fifth race day, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic network.
PANU POKKINEN, Head of Sport, is pleased with the ratings and recalls that viewers will be divided into several instruments for the first time in the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns are following the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers are choosing the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sporting competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When it comes to 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London Games or in the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a minor interest - if someone thinks it is weak - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the primaries, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, general sport is only just beginning, as are other species of Finnish interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the audience numbers at the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which rose to Apple App Store in the first days of the Games as the most free app in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
My guess is we're about 200 grand in charge.
"The ratings of the network will not be received until later." Pokkinen says
Rio Areena has not worked as hoped for by all users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games will be seen on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can track some species, and Yle Speech on the radio carries the races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most hard-working for the High, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Yle's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be displayed on both the Upper and Commercial Channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, where the depth of the lake is 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technology diving instructor, found a 20-square-metre push-up on Ristiselä, the depth of which was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 meters, "says Jari Hakala, Development Engineer.
So so far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Kallavesi and Pääjärvi.
They haven't been studied as closely as Daytime.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
"There may well be unknown depths," says Kannela.
If the deepest lake is defined by mid depth, it is Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
From this point of view, your Day does not get into the top ten, and the Suvasvesi is even further from the top.
Repair on August 12, at 14.29: The last paragraph was corrected, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Isolated from the tax area: Pensioners' taxation still tighter
The tax burden on pensioners is still higher than on employees.
The Ihalainen says that the injustice arose under the Parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
The government's proposal does not include this.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept up to date after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their working income, which reduced taxation.
In this Parliament, the case was heated by opposition representatives who were grilling Alexander Stubb, the then Minister of Finance, for election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it will not grow
In the line presented by the Minister for Finance, Petteri Orpo (Co.), tax reductions are mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that a tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (middle) and Orpo's messages on the desire to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact.
He says that it is important for credibility that we stick to the agreement.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment in a rickety
The honourable Member calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth, in the budgetary rivalry.
The number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of increasing the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed during the bombing in Thailand last night and last night of Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists who are going to Thailand to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions about caution are worth following, "says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalia, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season for Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombing.
The embassy has tried to target Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to find out about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalia says.
No information on the author
According to Westphalia, there's still no record of who did the attacks.
The ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and to the referendum last week on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalia says.
The Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalia says.
He says the town is celebrating Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
The traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should have an impact on the course of the day, so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, these attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, says the Thai police news agency AP.
There have been at least four deaths in Thailand in the last 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular by Finns, four bombs were detonated in the night by the resort Phuket, says the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs went off according to a newspaper in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs were detonated in Phang Nga, where according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
There was at least one death in each of the double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than in the south of Thailand and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it leads to the resorts of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
No one knows who did the attacks.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, leader of the military junta ruling Thailand, the attacker of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't be stirring people up to panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He said to the Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy advises Finns in Finland to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Embassy about caution, "says Westphalen.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the night in Finland and the victims.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little more information.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were injured in the second attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs went off in the vicinity of a bell tower, known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated in Hua Hin an area where they believe they have found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed according to the governor of the county.
An employee of the municipality was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The Chief of Police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half an hour or so.
Bangkok Post says the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America Biles won a four-way match for women.
Alexandra Raisman in the United States was the second with 60.098 points and the Russian Aija Mustafina the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still running for the Rion rink championships on the ass, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent over the last few years.
He's got eight personal world championships from the previous three years.
He has won four-game and permanto championships three times in a row and a boom in the last and the second years.
In the United States team, Biles has won two team championships in the world.
There are darker World Cup medals in Biles from the jump and the boom.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Strike has no impact on tourism"
Esa Hovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and runs a children's playground in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I do not think that this will lead to anything more amazing, the Finnish entrepreneur working in Asia for about twenty years will be judged by Hovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was avian flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these past ones haven't banished tourists, I don't think so either.
The office of the company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
The parlor found out about the attack on his own employee.
The employee called around 9: 00 in the morning and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The hotel says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up for the Queen's birthday, "says Hovila, referring to his Friday holiday in Thailand.
At the Patong the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10: 00 local time.
At the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard about the attacks.
About half past three in the day in Thailand time in Patong traffic had normalized and a large part of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, "says Hovila, who visited the scene of the attack.
Later the car in question was seen in Kruunupya on Jouxholmintie.
By the time the police got there, the car was set on fire.
Patrol picked up two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce.
The other man was caught right away.
One of them ran away, but the guy was found in the woods later with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of the use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated assault.
The police thank the people who tipped us off.
Research Director of Russian leadership changes: Clear sidelining
On Friday, the highest level of leadership change took place in Russia in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his regime chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a 44-year-old Estonian-speaking Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat. He was second in command of Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from exercising power independent of the President.
It is also possible that Ivanov may have been in trouble with other managers or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on specific environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said that the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other posts and proposed Vaina to replace him, "said Russia Today.
The fabric stream says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but became President Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pyhänniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, "said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of approximately 90% of the city of Manbiji, which is important to Isis.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.

Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, "says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister based the decision on the instructions of the Government Administration and on the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar rather than in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to the STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Like the last few years, Bolt has run against time under the prestige.
He insulted his back legs in the early ages and had to skip the Olympic tryouts in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, "Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
The story around Porina Bolt is that the Jamaican star has risen in a time when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 metres in the early stages of 21.05.
At the time, a 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training position.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of the rivals at the end of the celebration, at the time of the birth of 9.69.
This is harder.
One year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career at a legal point in time.
The world record that was born in Berlin at 9.58 and 19.19 at two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and a 19-second run-down, but nobody believes in it but Bolt himself.
With a hundred Bolt's toughest challenger, the Olympic champion of Athens 2004, Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated an American with only one hundred guns.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in the finals of the World Cup, if only he has made his way.
In Daegu, 2011, the 100-dollar World Cup was missed by Bolt because of a false source.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He's an old man of the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line for the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Revelations from Rio: two athletes are suspected of doping.
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, the Chinese banner Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner, Silvia Danekova, is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
He ranked fourth in Rio in women's 100-metre butterfly shooting.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese banner has brought its doping case to the CAS of the International Sports Appeal Court.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that a Bulgarian female runner, Silvia Danekova, has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has sent a sports coach home from Rio because of the doping violation.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) reported that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media records, this is Kenyan speed coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from a 800-meter runner, Ferguson Rotich.
The Phelps will not be stopped - historical gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympic Games, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam 200 metres in a mix in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in the mix before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, the BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton is laughing at a quick interview from Evening Magazine.
The article made on Monday by Helen Skelton (right) is one of the most read-out on this week's website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton won't be too stressed if there's a slight noise in the social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
I mean, the television is visual media. He's stressing it.
Skelton is dressed in high heels and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough prowess - at least for the eyes of many conservative British cats.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and the little rumors are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be a little startled, maybe even a bit alarmed, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
This isn't about me, he says.
They're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the noise has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a rumour of nothing if it comes from (presenter) dressing.
I'm a little amused if someone's been hit by one of these things.

Argentinian dami pounced the Betrayer-Siren - Finnish contemplation protest
The wind of the Betrayer Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind, Siren the Betrayer, went through a rough time on Thursday.
The lady of Argentina, the wind of the Betrayer-Siren on Thursday in Rio on the start of the women's surfing day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, "said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete was considering a protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been in vain under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, "said the Betrayer-Siren.
The Finnish man hung on his board until the last, because he didn't want to get caught in the dirty water of Rio.
The Finnish was left in place 27 with the accident.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Politalist is the eighth.
The crash didn't have much effect on the tip.
Friday's a big day for the race 10-12.
Modified to 0.39: Unlike the first information, the Betrayer-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that according to science extend age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring to him extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency to mid-body or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to piss. Just pick up the milk can is enough.
There have been many studies to try to find out the secret of a long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research findings.
Science tells me that all these things may bring us more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinking has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The Harvard University study concluded that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "reduced risk of death," especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, studies in favour of alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - one to three days - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental floss can extend the life of a person for up to six years, a study says.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected the life of a person.
A seven-year project watched over 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were more likely to live by the end of the experiment than those who were more obnoxious.
Sex, where protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his or her life, he or she must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity will add years. It will not be denied.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute tolerance.
A study by the University of Oxford found that the cholesterol levels of women with a big butt were lower.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won an Oscar at the Olympic Games, he's more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life for additional years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long-term life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among the over 65-year-olds found that a person shopping on a daily basis was probably less likely to be older than a shopper.
This is due to the fact that running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver with a dead body derailed into a truck.
On Friday night, there was a serious collision between a truck and a passenger car at Koski in Varsinais-Suomi.
The accident occurred in Koski, in the middle of the Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9: 00 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came in against it had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left in its lane after the crash, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and from there on over the ditch to the roof.
The woman who was born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's under suspicion of aggravated DUI.
The post office sent loose candy to the wrong town.
There were deficiencies in the selection of loose candy at Salon K-Citymarket because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candy at the Salon K-City Market when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product defects in loose sweets because the Post delivered our load to the Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post is able to deliver the load!
So if there's no traffic on the lawn mowing, the sign said so.
The sign that foxes its shop has to do with the fact that last spring the Post extended its services to lawn mowing.
Grass mowing is on the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with surprise.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this has attracted is incredible, "says Haltia.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 breakdowns on Facebook.
Elf got his own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few floors were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesosos, responsible for the business of Business Transport Services at the Post, regretted the damage suffered by Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki), and we no longer went to make a part delivery (Saloon) with three, but only today took five pallets, Kaidesoa told Ilta-Sanomat.
The first news to come out is the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not upset about the sign because she found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.

A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and adress with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinary Station and also had a nurse training there.

The update mentions that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily to the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviera woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Magazine that the victim was a very dear animal.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roosters.

The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court issued a judgment against Post for infringement of the Equal Opportunities Act
The post did not have the right to retain the salary of the employee who refused to introduce a temporary agency worker, assessed by the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the wages withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post Office could have withheld only part of the orientation salary corresponding to the share of the education throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been put at a disadvantage by virtue of his trade union activities in breach of the Equal Opportunities Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Association of the Union for Postal and Logistics Pau to ban familiarisation.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Post's employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who broke the strike.
It was first told by the People's News.

Putin fired the head of his regime... and replaced the Estonian-speaking Vaino.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired President-in-Office Sergei Ivanov, Kremlin says.
Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino, Communist leader of Soviet Estonia.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, "says Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin report, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's close inner circle, will take on specific tasks in the field of the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other posts and proposed Vaina to replace him, "says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet period in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before the re-election of Putin in 2012.
BBC: Departure of ManU - not seen in the opening of the League
You can't see the world record man in football moves on the field when the English Championships kick off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with him to England.
Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, "said the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to the Italian Society Juventus in Pogba.
However, the English Football Association (FA) is keeping him out of the game, as Pogba was left with Juventus as a burden on the game ban.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world-class artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festar travelers have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is the punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
Flow Festival event area is stalled with artificial grass and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival in Suvilahti Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's pretty unusual for an event production to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, "says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70 000 last year by 5 000.
A number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festival this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because we have to finance the work in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, controlled by huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks in a partially artificial grass-trimmed area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, the tent of 15,000 people will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our case.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work that has been done for the Kallio is that, today, great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the company operating Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It allows you to create "Greek things," like the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out in terms of content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, "says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own genre, but he does not have the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a concert in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a good job in the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, the guardian of wild animals who lived in Asia, referred to a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you can't get a good look at the tweet, you can check it out here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bars in the world, told Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet, the Swedish tourist.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs were detonated on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with Finns.
No one died, as far as I know.
At the same time, there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one of them died and three of them were wounded.
And another bomb went off in Trang City.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that hadn't yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there is likely to be rebel troops behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the Thai military leadership's actions.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations dealing with trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by force starts in a war situation
In the event of an acute war, it is not until several months after taking a military oath that military officers are ordered to fight, "says Keski Suomainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Military Training, interviewed by the magazine, the military personnel serving 5.5 months in the event of war are only able to fight those who are in the final stages of their training.
According to the Head of Education, the reserve forces are first assigned.
No conscripts or reservists are assigned to a post that has not received the required training, "says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it appeared that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel in immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a huge compensation for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, President and CEO Pauli Worma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house was EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house which caused microbial growth that was hazardous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Worma won the case both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeal.
The court of appeal issued a verdict on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the legal and procedural costs of the couple.
The right made the price reduction somewhat more moderate because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to the buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a fit home because they did not want to undertake any repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the facts mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned ventilation as risks and malfunctions and the lack of adequate management of rain- and melting-water flows along the rock study.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter in any way.
Tola and Worma were left with the impression that rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled in a few years' time.
The sales were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became clear that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
In 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth due both to the rainwater of the rock and the capillary rise in soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could also be reached indoors, according to the inspector.
The mould or yeast, which allows health risk, was found in brush samples from the home care room, the basement staircase, the living room window opener and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
There was also a dispute in the court as to whether the apartment had been extended in contravention of the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Worma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to change the dwelling in breach of the permit prior to the sale.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although no appropriate permits were yet in place.
However, mold problems were at the heart of justice.
According to the court of appeal, on the basis of the information received from the seller prior to the sale, it could be assumed that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider that there was any particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to provide information, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive survey: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children of the Nazis - also Finns in the register
Editor Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter how documents have been stored on microfilms in the US National Archives in Maryland for a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards originate from the National Agency for Racism in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the authority of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
This was even more true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
Ratification was a study of the background of women, including through the study of church books.
The purpose was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency hand-written biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good national socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the brides of SS men.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive's documents.
The SS leaders created a government-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, it was stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not promoted very actively, the site of the US Holocaust Museum is reported.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
The German mother was awarded an honorary prize to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were prohibited by law, as stated on the museum's website.

Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the barman of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, Finland's best selling solo artist, and the star of the dance stage and festival, Sillanpää can still boast, and she is currently in a very violent state.
The book Jari Sillanpää, which was written by Mari Koptinen, is about the life of her favorite singer, was published today, Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in good and evil.
The career of the bridge head rose to a total climb when he won the crown of the tango king on the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang thongs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppämäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in the history of music in Finland.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go according to plan: the bridge head sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
Oh, my God, I was so crazed!
The head of the bridge remembers in a book.
You wouldn't know it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to insist on being perfect and top.
The second incident related to the most popular pieces of a man, which is described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his former partner and the case ended up in the texts of "You deserve gold" published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics ordered from Saara Kola were not what the Shillhead would have liked.
The bridge head had imagined that he was making a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the chapter on divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the 7-day news.
In the newspaper news, Jari and his ex-lover's divorce was attributed to Jari's excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was full of crap and it wasn't true.
Jari called the record company angry and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
At the end of the day, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls for the week of the vote anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the resignation, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign by the former President of the United States, Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid," flew into the junk in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, is responding to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists' loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's away from the real British.
Many also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
The economist felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently evident.
They were particularly struck by the neutrality of the BBC, which allowed only a few per cent of the economists in favour of the EU divorce as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other high-level economic combinations were about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not share any common interests.
Academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant puts congestion on your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British man get a doctor's appointment if he didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for a real British kid to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they took off?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The economists did not succeed in explaining that immigrants have made it possible for the British to have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU-divorce camp, began to prepare for more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large liquid assets, but they could now be needed.
We left to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, "says Mr Vanhanen about the only open daily real estate fund in Aberdeen, which the news was about.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15% and 20%.
The value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, "says Vanhanen about all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was at or even below 10%.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp in favour of the EU divorce won, Europe went nuts.
However, the last few weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, "says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that the Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they raided the situation and put it in the main headings of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, "says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash collected, but it was also eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade, but changed prices downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and the majority withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it has been very smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, "says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the Aberdeen continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of enquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
In his view, the closure of real estate funds' transactions received excessive attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds on the side of 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ramped down, but the situation does not appear to be "wilder 'for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Mr Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Old Man says.
Brexit brought down the real estate market in London.
At 2: 00 in the morning, things didn't look so good yet.
But at 4: 00, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, came back to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of strength.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B, "says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the early hours of the morning.
At the office, the TV screens, which were normally set to be silent, filled the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals were looking at nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd be alive, "says the Old Man.
It is not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate transactions on the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. on the midsummer.
It was a mixed mood.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that was why the situation was in a sense calm, "says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went in for a change.
The market was beginning to anticipate drastic reductions in the real estate market in Britain and in particular in London.
The London office premises were expected to be negative by up to 20% in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after the other.
Aberde did it for six days, too.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not, however, show its last summer holidays in the face of the old man who spent his summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit will do.
So much remains open: how the difference is made and how Scotland responds to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of primary information.
CBRE's data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all buildings in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the minus was generated, "says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index started to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, "says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began on the US property market.
The old man does not think that the comparison is quite right, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
The mood is different too.
The real estate market has now not seen a panic sale like that, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, "says Mr Vanhanen.
You can find a financial balance as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he does not think that the price adjustment movement is a miracle - it could have been in front of him without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of real estate in London and other world's top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, "says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a very high level.
London prices have been tightening upwards for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, "says Vanhanen.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fed by a low interest rate, which has meant, for example, that pension companies have had to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Mr Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used much less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Spread out, scatter, scatter
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, "says Vanhanen.
Aberde also started to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's next?
That depends on how the British economy develops, "says Mr Vanhanen.
A lot he's afraid to judge for the future, but he says there's probably not much to go on.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even trend ahead.
The old man has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can handle the holes with work.
If you are well prepared for risk, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, "says Vanhanen.
S-group starts to register purchase data more closely than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group today told us that it will start collecting more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
So far, when information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start to collect it at the beginning of May for purchased products as well.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most powerful channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information, "says Riitala.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to grocery purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil, for example, do not give up their knowledge.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty program and is not currently planning to do so.
The Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkönsbonus customer-client program, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer loyalty programme is to be revised in the future, but the close-up shop will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
The customer register and the customer register of SOK have been relatively wide until now.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data included occupation, education, housing and birth years of children and past personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-Front card purchase records the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the method of payment.
In addition, the information provided by the S-bonus partners is derived from their cash schemes.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismas, Terror Home and ABC chains data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, "says Marjaana Saarikoski, customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they will inform their customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the checkout, whether they like it or not.
The person wishing to do so may check the data stored on the S-Group website.
For example, the cashiers have no access to the data, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tulli's latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever puppy is vigorously sniffing five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio awards his Heila dog to play with that favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of shells that smelled like gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Main reasons for security and online commerce
Heila is Tulli's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, work may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job of Heila because the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in Customs and, following the attacks, controls have been strengthened, "says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gundog and an explosive dog in Tulli's tasks is mail through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail deliveries via the airport every year may include foreign-ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their precursors, from the purchase of online shops at Helsinki Airport, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be looking into registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, "says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Mrs Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio will also attend training with Heila with police and military experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs, and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what odours Heila is taught to identify.
Helila is always further trained as needed, "says Grönberg.
Helila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and Massi, a money and drug dog.
The Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected at the airport include a high-speed and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila is close to the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
There's nothing you can do without Hila at home. Suntio's laughing.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time shot.
The evening-message cameraman loses the camera's microphone to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy guard immediately on the "off" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be ready next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in Helsinki Airport on the next half of the year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to ironing the dog on top of the vest, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to EUR 70000 per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work rates only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Tulli.
Hila's owner was applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Fortune hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and surveillance duties in Customs.
The mini-state received its first Olympic medal - the people get the day off
Fiji's Olympic gold in rugby, with less than one million inhabitants, is valued so high that the government has ordered 22 August as a national holiday.
According to the nation's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed this after the championship was over.
The day off will be the day after the team gets home.
There will also be celebrations for the Hero Team in their country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian tells us that there was a final in the country in Suva, capital, where a screen had been erected on the stadium.
Normally only native Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheer, said the Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lift fainted after a wild performance
Milko Tokola, the weightlifter, succeeded with his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a unique and life-threatening feature for a lifeguard.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
Tokola got 175 kilos of labor in Rio and 145 kilos of stunt.
He came in at 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push at the last 175 kilos, as did the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights were raised by a lot of screaming.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finnish lifeguard was caused by the fact that he has suffered knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian invader Prosa - The League of Values - Evening-Messages
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a long-term contract with the Estonian invader Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player with a low threshold for Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good option, "says Juha Malinen, coach of RoPS in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the Tallinna Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He's also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi people will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goalKing Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The daring Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become familiar with Alex Dunphy as a modern Family comedian, flashes again by showing her threatening body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet, but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making her style and behaviour much bolder.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very sparse outfits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look it up here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At that time, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter was only 11 years old when he was in Modern Family.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time, when the downhill is already so tough, says a woman at Winter's Instagram.
Some women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, glowing up a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see the stormy mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese visitors to start Northern Lights as early as early autumn, "Visit Finland explains in the press release.
The main destinations for Japanese northern lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
There is a strong demand for northern lights trips in Lapland in winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the northern lights season starts from early autumn and goes on to long spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times a fairy tale, "says Anne Lind, Vice President Marketing of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign focuses on wealthy women aged 25 to 35, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and its design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the country among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lind, the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland, "Lind says.
Britain is satisfied with rugbyhopea as Fid's master course leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed on Fiji's final challenge in the Thursday night finals when the team experienced a 43-7 crush loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master course in reading, biting, evasive, supporting, running lines and in pure force when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat was accompanied by a reasonable consolation of the silver medal - the third of British Day - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic Rugby tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semifinal played the same day may have bothered them in the finals.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 in the best shape.
Great Britain may be comforted - but probably not - by the fact that at least one British guy has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip in Great Britain.
Eight years ago, trained by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they only lost one.
This spanking hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently in the fight against the British tackle for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running towards the moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner of the target area.
When there were four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was just a slow-down for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for the new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... for the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through Britain's loose tackle and stormed the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's actually the way it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes during the break that blocked the Fid dam... for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half period was good until Josua Tuisova scored the goal after the impressive Fid feeder game.
Dan Norton scored for Britain when he scored the touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Isles, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyous approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute paint was frosting on Fid's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidites hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semi-final of 20-5, and Great Britain won South Africa in a tight semi-finals, where both scored one goal - Britain's goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of the England 15-step rugby team Anthony, secured victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's battle against cancer paved the way for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to roam.
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard yawns towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present the whole time when the two of them were playing their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's match - the first ladies in the history books of British sport to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two great athletes soaring on the surface with swan's sweetness, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually contribute to the things that matter; and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know whether he would live to this day, having been diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, it was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the interoperable things, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trident was lucky to be able to start his treatment in early 2014 outside the period when they caused as little interference as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stoning, a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment who had been deployed to Afghanistan, said: "I have been a emotional union this week, which may be a little over-reacting, but this means so much to me."
It only highlights how important this is to me, how hard Helen and Robin have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
If it weren't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so she deserves a big thank you, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stoning haven't lost the race in five years.
A couple of them set a rough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very caught in a moment.
Helen screamed, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.

Iceland will change the government that has been bugged by the Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already demanded by protestors who have been infuriated by the Panama data spills in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict the impact of the people's last spring's rage on the results of the autumn elections.
In June, the presidential elections showed clear criticism of the power-holders, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside of politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of the Isis.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States Republicans, withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic when he said that President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and that the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the army who could sink that low, Clinton txt.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkin bathing suit, which is popular with Muslims, on the beaches, says Guardia, among other things.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to beaches and to swim for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are a major expression of religious affiliation, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist men linked to Isis attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - blue algae opacity in Lake Pushukösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality standards for bathing water.
Only a blue-leaf opacities have been observed at the beach in Lake Euskösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E. coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water concentrations of E. coli and enterococci were confirmed at Meriniemi beach on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity observed at the shore of Lake Euskösjärvi does not yet make the water unbathing, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, making blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water as ferries.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through more frequent inspections.
If the blue-leaved bloom turns into blue-leaved bloom, it will also be communicated separately on the table on the beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MK Hakkarainen's forest gift reduction: over 80% of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the conversion of forest holdings.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal on forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest holdings is a good one, commented Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hackarainen finds something to criticise in the tax amendment proposal.
A reduction in forest gifts is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
The MTK and Hakkarainen argue that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales result of wood.
The VM's proposal is based on the fact that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of the income from forestry which would be deducted from other taxes.
A person like this would get tax benefits even if the wood wasn't sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to grasp it, "says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high by Hakarainen.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forest policy, according to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been carried forward for decades.
The background to this is the ageing of the forest owners' community.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about one-half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful hail deaf surprised the motorists in Himanga, two cars derailed and collided with each other.
On Friday morning, there was an unusual chase on the Himanga of the Kalajoki River.
According to the rescue department, two cars that drove in a row went into a ditch, and then the one behind them ran into the one who drove ahead.
According to the on-call firefighter, Harri Pyhankä, the fall into the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
The car in the back had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's nothing more specific about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the car above did not get hurt.
An accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to become more effective.
The findings of the Academy aprof- Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumour increases the malignancies of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissues, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of drug treatments for cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The research results were published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
The murder of Muhos' family home is continuing in court, the prosecution is demanding a murder sentence for another perpetrator as well.
In the court of the court, the family home invasion of Muhos continues for both sentenced persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home murder in Muhos.
The second was given eight years for four months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The second is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The guilty party was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and the unauthorised carriage of a vehicle as a young person.
The district court's judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor calls on a man with a lesser sentence to be convicted of a murder committed as a young person for 12 years in prison.
At the time they were made, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young people killed a man who worked as a director of the child protection unit in the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked a pilot from behind on the couch in the living room.
The pilot had gotten out of his grip and led the young to his room, and one of the young people hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time.
According to the court, young people had been planning to escape from the family home at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived backbone, growing only at 156
The world's longest living vertebrate is confirmed by the ice shark, "says the study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark swimming around Greenland can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The fact that it grows only a centimeter per year increases the lifespan of the ice shark.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists found out about age with the radio-carbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as financial wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the state's total tax revenue would not be received if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through tax cuts that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax rate would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money left to collect, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39,6, after the Trump rebate of 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Mr Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the economy and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in the event of an emergency need to be reformed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed 'experts rather than bureaucrats'.
According to Mr Trump, a 'destructive' trade policy is one of the main causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be denounced.
For imports from China, a penalty tax of 45% and for Mexico 35% would be imposed.
We offer a new future.
American, not global, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his methods, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well organised protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme as taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early Friday Finnish time.
Tsunami from the past - People's News
The sea is a fateful turmoil, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street riots - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun and raggedy satirical comedy, a prelude to the Skin where I live (2011) at the top of the career of a Spanish champion.
On a level playing field, Julie (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventional serene love, relationship and family drama, centred on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen much as a long flashback.
Life seems to be the model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a rear and long letter, Julie times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Juliet as a young teacher, will be the second leading woman, from the TV-familiar series "The Time Between the Ommelte" (2013-2014).
The aging of Juliet has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a mess, but I would say that it is rather timely and verbatim with a single sweep.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance to such characteristic blaring, up to the humor of Juliet.
It is a film that is equally played, restrained, and has some good music and is quite sad, with elements of elegy in it.
On the other hand, the typical visual saturation of the Spanish director is still present and is gradually beginning to appear as a pure formality rather than as a functional drama tool.
The people in the film are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true in the case of clothing: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from one scene to the next, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue, which is the tune of the scene in question, is not going to improve in particular.
In mechanical repetition, the impression is external and a little spirit-free.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Alice Munro, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2013.
The novels have been published in the book "Runaway: Stories."
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unparalleled for more dramatic drama, that much big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the film will be dealt with.
Direction and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is August 12th.
The Government is trying the election trick - People's News
No further cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of the United Kingdom do not collapse completely.
However, there are a lot of cuts decided on in the spring.
There will be no further cuts.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided are sufficient.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (third party) with a budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic protection for unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension definition are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts are continuing.
The municipal elections are haunted.
Why are the ministers so hesitant to stress that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
The polls, however, tell us that the Party of Government is waiting for the Finns to lose their butts, even though the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the Parliamentary elections of 12.3 per cent.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new councillors, most of which will be realised next spring by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three governments of a party of about equal size depends on the survival of the Finns.
Today it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the state of fermentation of the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
There will be no further cuts in rhetoric, firstly, to obscure the fact that next year they will be draconian and, secondly, to try to soften the waiting blow for the Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different if the government of Sipilä is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of settling debt in this parliamentary term, but the draft budget of Petteri Orpo will take on EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not or is not slowed down.
One is to hold on to the program.
It means even tougher cuts on the former in the 2017 budget rigidities.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring we will take what comes into the parliamentary elections.
These measures did not reduce the debt ratio
It is quite clear that the current measures did not solve the debt problem, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Mr Martti Hetemäki at the awareness-raising meeting prove this unquestionably:
Projections of growth in the world economy have repeatedly proved to be university-based, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
Finland's economy has not increased much since the collapse in 2008, except during a temporary recovery policy in the early 2010's.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered entirely by a new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the Finns as to what is responsible.
Questionnaire: A lot of tasks to be left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population is responsible to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building control, upper secondary education and waste management.
For their part, the province's responsibility is the province's planning, special medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks of local authority authority are intended to be transferred to the State.
At the end of the chase, the underage drunk driver ran away from the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu was driving a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsi Road on Friday night around half past 1: 00.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off to run from a police officer at a fair speed.
The chase continued to take place on the Sonkaajannantie, where the Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, a young man ran away, but a faster-legged cop ran off to catch a fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch on Lake Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night around 9: 15.
The truck had drifted to the left in a turning turn out of the road and fell on its side in a ditch.
The rescue service pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
The truck fell down and ran down into the road with hydraulic oil that the rescue department sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Air River.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about 5 '6 "tall, thin and well-timed with white hair that goes under her chin.
Observations and tips on missing persons's movements are requested to call Pohjanmaa Situation Centre's tip number 0295440513.
Major material in the air - look at the photo gallery of Parafest's destruction
The surge that hit the tents of the Parafest Festival caused a great deal of damage.
The Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
At the end of Friday night, Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, performed on the stage.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances on the premises of the city theater starting at 1 p.m.
The Parafest exhibition is held at the Art Centre in Ahja between 1: 00 and 3: 00.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The plunge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the state of the water in the thunder are binding on heat and therefore the declining air mass is cooling and its speed towards the ground is accelerating.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is told that there are several downcurrents in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash currents.
The crash flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum of Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5: 00.
Three tents fell over, there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child who was transported slightly injured to follow-on treatment.
Air pollution is aging the people of London.
According to the study, the skin of the Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is about the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many people of retirement age in London have two and a half years older skin than, for example, those living in rural areas.
Skin aging particles are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
In the Cac study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk along congested streets on their way to work.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
The brakes of the tractor failed... pushed the man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not get hit by it, but the tractor did push the man to the point where he was transported to the central hospital with serious injuries to follow-up examinations.
The tractor didn't have time to run any further, because it crashed into the rocks in front of it.
The Riento with new strength for the coming season
The Olympic League-Riento, playing in the Championships of the volleyball, is going to the series starting in October from a better starting point than a male memory.
The team's been together for three weeks now.
A common tune can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when Rienno has had a gloomy beginning.
Jani Säisä, who continues to be the head coach of Rinko, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
From the foreign trio, Fred Musoni will begin his second term in Rienno.
The new face is a 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwanda national team, is a 5 '5 "picker.
Garchet is a passport, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team.
Anne Jumpanen has been playing at almost all the World Series of Salibandy since 2003.
Now in Tampere are already going to the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada when it was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States of America was setting up a national team for the Salibandy.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumpmann, 48, says.
Jumpanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jukmanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, they didn't yet play that kind of game on the SM level like a salibandy.
They played electricity in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the Jokiboys hockey in the SM series, Jumpanen remembers.
During the 1991-92 season, the following three seasons were played in Josba with the university.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumpanen played in the women's SM series through 10. The balance was accumulated in 169 matches 51 + 34 = 85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänen were nominated to the national team
Joensuu's Salibandy Society was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoist Tatu Väänen to participate in the Finnish national team, which will play at the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska, who invades Helsinki, has previously played six men's land games where he has accumulated a total of 9 + 4 = 13 power points.
The 32-year-old defenseman of the Swiss-based Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänen, has recovered from the pain of the thighs and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 ground games experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, a basketball player of the Seinäjoki Game Brothers, who was last seen in a Finnish shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, Contilahti, is the main coach of the Salibandymaa team.
Beach volley bender Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Beach Volley Finnish Championships will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola volleyball players and Finnish volleyball association, the Finnish Championship final tournament is eligible for the top six pairs of each series of rankings.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Eimäki NMKY, who was raised by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley championships for several years.
Today, the Helsinki resident, Hasu, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the laundry stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals in the homestead, Hasu's atmosphere.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark in sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started the volleyball when I was nine years old at the E-girls at the NMKY in Elimäki.
On top is the idea of too big a jersey, knee protectors spinning around the ankles and the staggering ace screams and choreography after the point, "Hasu remembers.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - our teammate's father coached us and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hassel's beach volley was already a natural selection of the species to counterbalance the volleyball.
There have been songs playing at the Lake Koyräjärvi since the 1990s.
At the pulpit, the activity has always been active.
I also went on my own tour of the Junior SM tour, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Annie Parkinen from Pieksäkeläinen during the Finnish Championship finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti the goal of the second-punished duo is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack the SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws riddles.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be the last to go to Hasus in front of a familiar audience.
New challenges in civil work await us at the beginning of September.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the flip-flops will be placed on the nail.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near.

Salomon Koli was brave enough to go into farming.
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working with his little brother Valtteri Koli shortly two years ago as an extension of their home estate.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and an increase in the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always liked to do things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard drive, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was very brave enough to participate in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, "says Solomon Koli, and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is going to be okay.

Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure for years (after June 2012) and the first one above zero since last year's October, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, stood at -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), when compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost-of-living index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, an increase in the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages was observed in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, anime has been an inspiration to the filter, but according to some observers it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million of its daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, or a dog, or a character that would fit into Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lentils are simple, face-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
The Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised by accusations that the app advertises a blackface mask or favours bleached skin color as a beauty product.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellow face" or Yellowface.
And they're wondering if these recurring polemiks could be a sign of the company's bigger problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and the Mother board, a day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters, not a caricature of the Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied a comparison of the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photographs was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison of the outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects side by side."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the meeting rooms of the corporations to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And the huge audience of young people who are more diverse than their parents at Snapchat can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
The 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much harder for these guys to be discreet."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu judged the company's main white male management and finished writing with hashtag # DeleteSnapchat (# DelistäSnapchat)
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private enterprise.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to the representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and to take forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Do you think they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the congress panel, military officials falsified Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the congress panel said that the authorities at the headquarters of the US Armed Forces Military Region modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against Isis than was justified by the events on the ground.
The interim report by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee of the Defence Appropriations identified "widespread dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts at the headquarters who said that their superiors tampered with their assessment of the American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Cencom, is the headquarters of the Military Region in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The findings of the inquiry, which were accepted by the senior CEECCOM leaders, typically gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground, which were normally more positive than the analyses produced by other elements of the intelligence community," said the press release in the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said representative Ken Calvert, the Republican of California.
The failures of the Centrum leadership reach the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the persistent problems encountered in the descriptions and analyses of the headquarters of the United States of America's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the senior administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be tampered with, it shows that the analysts felt that the leaders of Cencom put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from headquarters to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centrum Authority publicly stated that a major attack on the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of Isis.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders in the US Armed Forces Military Region headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters in order to belittle the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence from the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results in the course of the investigation.
The Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional ongoing investigation into Centrum's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic Committee of the House of Representatives published its own findings, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015," said Mr Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democrat, who set up an unnecessarily isolated process in the intelligence assessment of Isis and the Iraqi security forces.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs," deteriorated the mood among analysts and "did not allow enough room for diverging perspectives."
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure the analysts at Centrum to reconcile their conclusions with the 'predetermined or political narrative'.
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday's preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has opened an investigation following complaints from the analysts at Centrom.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congress report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions than the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned the extent to which President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reflects a dispute of over a decade ago when the Centrom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote an article saying that, despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush's regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion concerning the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, the air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic state had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil via the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Last year, after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war, General Lloyd J. Austin III began to be criticised.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organising a showdown with Britain
The day after having scored three goals for the team when winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday the American women's field hockey team's first two goals for the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation at the Olympic tournament and they are sharing their group's first place with Britain, which was still undefeated after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who is first and second in their six teams.
First placed to avoid a strong Dutch leader, the second group leader, a little longer at the beginning of the quarter finals.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans have been stirring up with their surprising success here, four years after they were the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (he and his twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) in connection with the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, the English man Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a full turn.
On Thursday night Bam started the first half-time goal with a backhand close to the goal.
India had come into the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation from 1-0 to the end of the third period when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then rolled into the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, bringing the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in mid-fourth period.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender to play for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the trampoline in the midst of the Olympic zeal
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympic Games are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton of messages passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read the newspaper or listen to the conversation of the guest in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympic Games and the future heartbreaker with a smile cup, could well be one of the names known to all, which are presented at the best time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-faith TV ads - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for an Olympic ball in a trampoline.
The Olympics don't light up all the species as much as they do.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, are the species that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breast. Long live it.
But if I may make a reasonable number of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, there are so few comments in the past 16 years about its presence that many of the people I interviewed did not realise it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal, and its athlete did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russian usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their gold medals in London.
However, trampoline has a certain charm for underdog, partly because it sounds more suited to clown school than to the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
There are opportunities for amusement in the species, as you can see from the vibrations of the endless bouncy of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swim jumping, the two species that are basically combined in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means a springboard.
The aspirers of the championship jump with a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet and they have to carry out rolling motion series (turns, folds and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
In Rio, there are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those who wish a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in television coverage, another grotesque border: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and can even make the viewer cry.
But that's also the reason why watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers me a moment of rest from this.
Trampoline heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises again, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no fierce rush to the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as it can get at the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 1: 00 (ET), men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 1: 00.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon program starting at 2: 00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which most likely will not be noticed in public chaos.
And if consciousness is only achieved by offering male surfers to stare and objectify (as the US male gymnast suggested some time ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan community.
"The generation is demonstrating" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protestors have been shot to death during the clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to break?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, demonstrations against the government have shaken the country as they spread to an increasing number of regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The spread of videos recorded during demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, shows how the security authorities are beating young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' main human rights authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives that much aid from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the repression of the government, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are showing their minds.
One generation will show their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition ruling on land use in the strangulation hold.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last place held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why, after years of turbulence, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first one seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the Internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate via hidden web relays.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Orons and the Amharas, are getting along better.
Oroms and Amharas are not natural allies.
The very long-term Amharas, which come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business using the Oramas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"We are on our way to organization under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo Director.
The biggest demonstrations have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromas think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, which account for about 6% of the population and control armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"There is no such basic instinct today," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethiopia Tigre region, Hailemariam is from the south.
The analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this could lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in a state of such turmoil in 2005, thousands of people protested at the elections which, according to the analysts, appeared to have been faded by the government and then robbed.
In the aftermath of the crackdown, many demonstrators died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the Ethiopian leaders for their vision of infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and for their considerable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt of the Ethiopian Government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked companies owned by the tigres, and the anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights in neighbouring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it had closed this base.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, they do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This one," Abdi said, "is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-founded-Isis claim to be "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the dispute that had taken over his last campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when this week he repeatedly suggested that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also put his defensemen, who have been struggling to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position in which they have to explain remarks which he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump said the same more and more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, in which he suggested that it was indeed his intention to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
In the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said, however, that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When the Conservative host, Hugh Hewitt, tried to help Trump lift his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The latest critics come from a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign among the results of opinion polls that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
Running back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, when he was faced with widespread criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course I am sarcastic."
This approach will allow Trump to make a political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then" clarifies "in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is cunning about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several lenses.
Instead of softening their speeches for the great turnout, Trump has been more glaring in recent days, as his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist survey, published on Friday, showed that Trump lags behind Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misreading his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position, in which they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe there are real political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about veracity in relation to Trump's assertion that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
That is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organisation which he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter the attack on the news media, which are going on about every word he says and are biased against him.
He made fun of the "bad, pathetic" television experts who were trying to figure him out saying, "They're not gonna make it!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new piece of evidence that he was unfit for president.
The previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soap in the shape of cupcake.
The locals regretted it as the last loss in a city to be restructured to be middle class.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is about change, it's about reinventing.
The revived verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and it has the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and buys the same model espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try it.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon and egg egg cheese sandwiches on the menu, and the covers offer for example capers and brownish onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers too," he said.
One of last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb on a regular basis.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a coffee shop.
He says after Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, although on that day he ordered a chai, mixed instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully from 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, on a regular basis as the clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
The photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese for a change.
Rodriguez says he has no grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient in cold-extracted coffee at the coffee shop.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to bring it up soon to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the next building.
A lot of customers need to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said he was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: the paralyzing food of the recession
In March 1933, shortly after becoming President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated food from Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
On that day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is a bunch of food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in 97 Orchard.
Their newest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some sort of culinary solidarity, they meet at a journalist's dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been active since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato mash and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the recession.
"The crumbs were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from a ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe made a mockery.
"It must have felt heavy in the stomach," he said.
The years before the recession on American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-as-much-as-episodes-pick-up table.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal chronized the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing subject for the Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as meatloaf and boxes, became the main dishes, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, because the cooks were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the centre of American meals for years, became a thriving luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when calories and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman prepared a course of the era in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter when he did the research for a book containing recipes.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of converting blooms like soiled spaghetti and carrots into tasteful portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavors.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat the cake attitude.
While he publicly praised his childhood's simple, Iowa country food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gold-plated dining room.
He was so out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only the worst food in Washington, but also the worst prepared food."
As soon as the country got back on its feet, many of the poor eating habits were abandoned.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she could not throw food away.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman thought, "He even made people sick."
There's been an incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give a name to modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was unwilling to sink their spoons into a sticky, brown dustpan.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe said once and again.
Sounded like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: "A little chopped walnuts could be helped."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Mercedes
The US betrothal judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to legal expenses incurred in a case involving a patient with hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million fee for violating two Merck patents relating to Gilead's success drugs in Sovaldi and Harvoni, which followed the discovery by an American judge of Merck's abuses, including false oath and other unethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, the US Advocate General, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it suffered in the event of opposition to the action.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, which controls the market in a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can cure clearly more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case is due to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of Sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead's medicines.
The forces supported by the United States say that Manbij, ruled by Isis, has been completely taken over.
Since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday, troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manbij in the north near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2000 wing hostages, held prisoner by the combatants, of Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally group, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was USD 10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, the former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for his book on his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10 years of tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's campaign assistant.
As a strong contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for the presidential candidates of the United States to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax board's audit to refuse to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, a special assistant to Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his transactions and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem by publishing an online video on Friday, highlighting visible Republicans who are urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in recent decades: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two nineties, and the business column of the New York Times borrowed on Friday a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
According to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Clinton has supported a rule that would ensure that more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Omaha in Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he too had an audit of the tax administration and that Trump was not "afraid" of the tax collection agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clinton people living in New York Chappaqua was around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and their actual combined tax rate was around 40.5%.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an inexpensive, indexed investment fund, and Clinton reported $109 000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephant
Protectors in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw out animals with chilli powder-filled condoms.
The method has proved to be effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without the animals being injured.
In the past, a lot of people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we've developed... tools, we've seen a change in attitude in these communities. They're now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Chief Executive Officer of Honeygues.
The first two steps include pointing the intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud."
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and a firecracker, after which the condom is rotated so that only the fuse is visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts and bursts the chilli powder dust into the air.
One fragrance is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a detonator that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT news: A Jewish filmmaker criticises a Berlin hotel that removed the area code of Israel at the request of the Arabs
A French filmmaker with a Jewish background unleashed media yrsky after discovering that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not list the area number of Israel. According to the worker, this is due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary film about the Holocaust, decapitated his frustration at the Berlin hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to find the area code list of the countries offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own telephone centre.
While looking for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from there "shocked him."
The hotel's prescriber said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision was even more dismayed by the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli area code," says the employee said Lanzmann.
The Israeli German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That is a great injustice in itself.
But the greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "said the official.
The incident produced quite a resistance online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame," said the second publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called what happened "inattentive" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the shortcut list was never made," says Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students.
On Thursday, students joined forces with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when the students gathered to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems started when law enforcement was trying to break up a bunch of students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Land of Sao Paolo, Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed down and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters started to move together to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended while the Senate voted on his impeachment.

Since the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent from the previous year, "says Levan Dzhagaryan, Ambassador of Russia in Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in their transactions in the country, as the ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, Iran's two-way cooperation is one of the main objectives of trade expansion," said Dzhagaryan.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015, totalling USD 856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to 158 million dollars.
"Trade growth was achieved by the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will break," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner hit the finish line while the British caught bike gold.
The Callum Skinner of Scotland praised the men's team print at the Rio Biking Stadium last night, when the British team trio defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man when he went to the finish line, gaining a victory over the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick when they made a modest investment in the March race at the World Cup in London, even though Hoy has since ended his race.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was replacing special sender Jamie Staff.
This was achieved just in time when Hindes appeared.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches were holding onto in front of the Scots for the potential that is now being met.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner made the Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took over the first round.
And the British Triangle won a duel for gold.
After his own round, Hindes was a little behind, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation and included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We made an Olympic record at the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling sports both in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are facing a successful five-day cycle stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic balls in one of the Olympics.
That would mean that the total number of medals of Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (apparently on that holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next to compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one.
The team competition is always the best.
You win it with your friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely. "
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the knight's rank."
This was the only medal race today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doulle were the fastest in time for a four-man, four-mile team chase.
Their time was 3: 51: 943.
The world record in London 2012 is 3: 51: 659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time drive when the officers invited him for a height measurement.
In a similar race for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald moved forward in world record time as the clock stopped at 4: 13: 260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and reach a whole series of medals.
After a truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
The background has been drama, the least of which has been the resignation in April of the Technical Director, Shane Sutton, for sexist and bullying charges, and the end of a career of great people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first-night competition at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's legendary reputation at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The future of Portland's meltdown is questionable as a result of the cut in the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the owners of the plant is closing the distribution agreement, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria administration that the aid required to keep the plant in operation will not be extended.
The subsidy for a period of 20 years will expire in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland factory.
Up to 2000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the fuse uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's meltdown, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea plant.
The Alcoa Portland Melt is losing money and under threat of closure.
The measure now follows the speculation that has lasted for several years about the future of the plant, which started with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of its production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the smaller shares are owned by the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL looks forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the melting-free physical electricity demand will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "hedging agreements" which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a period of notice of 12 months and will therefore be effectively terminated in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects contracts to result in profit for the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said that it had already, "in anticipation of the end," reduced the value of the contracts by USD 187 million in its accounts.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to maintain the melting process or to secure the non-melting power supply."
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it was supposed to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert both to the melting of Portland in Victoria and also to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic situation in this sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL's Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen said to analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago around 900 megawatts every year.
"If both plants exit the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us, as a power producer, this would not be a good thing, "he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, model and mother manager, is on the cover of the American Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, who is a brand messenger for Estee Lauder and has been a model for Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of people I love made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release was followed by an extraordinary (or perhaps just a Kardashian style?), a handwritten reality video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, which was accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but ended up in a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the cliché of almost every children's "birthday period" (Seacrest says the lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny guy), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era with the location of the Vogue in September.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's application first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite different.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more similar to the coffee protocol than the fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of the 832 pages last year was advertising content).
The revelation of that star will be so eagerly awaited that for the last two years the photos of the newspaper have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities" on the cover as models than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's honorary seat.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, who the magazine describes as the "success model" of his generation, would hit the first category, he'd be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or real stars or young people today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are quite rightly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career since Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of the moment."
This feeling came back to the surface with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But it's inappropriate to spin around in discontent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications beyond the pay-per-view wall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her kids, she's a reality star.
Each year, 160 000 people are turned away by Community legal centres.
The most vulnerable among more than 160 000 people will be turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the effects of further financial cuts on its already extreme border activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the means to fight unfair evictions and so on - are already being turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Community Legal Centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres calculation report, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, families separated, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected residents of Queensland will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palazzczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was accused of being held with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after being told that the head of North Carolina's campaign was holding a gun to the employee in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordin in Charlotte on Wednesday at the state court.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "pulled out the pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
Having complained to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, it was said in the action.
"Guns do not need to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of the second addition" - usually understood by weapons owners and arms takers - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless control and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
The Trump representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, local news company in Charlotte reported Phillip recently leaving the campaign.
His consultant's call to Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
The campaign of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Supreme Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and bloom to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and to different parts of London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to a tremendous amount of effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 London Games, some will come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the race and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just for a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and an economic growth of GBP 211 billion, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented the £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5, which has been voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising are a "cat and mouse game," said one of the companies that produce such a programme.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers from using their computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program filters to prevent further ads on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's circled a new code.
In the blog, Adblock's representative, Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of back-fighting between the open source advertising community and its travellers has been going on since the discovery of the blocking of advertisements," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great sorrow that has become for industry as a result of the blocking of advertising.
Worldwide, around 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in last year's Pagefair and Adobe study, which is almost quadruple the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company is after computer-based ad advertisers, as mobile advertisements do not work for Facebook mobile applications for social networks or Instagram, "said the representative.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook think that this type of transaction is worth investing in.
Even on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more power over how to target advertisements.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the non-advertising content of the site.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," said the Facebook representative in the email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway in the early hours of Thursday in a case which was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the Canton of Vaudi just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and laid down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, "Vaudi police said in a statement.
The victim, clearly trying to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Many of the drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, said the police, who appeal to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, a lawyer named Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - where there was a person who walked on a dark motorway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night, it was said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent manslaughter after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court was informed.
The Court found that the police who were responding to an emergency call were driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man in the road was a "completely unusual and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, could sometimes have been subject to ground-like conditions.
Scientists have previously argued that Venus's slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and could still have been rolling slowly.
The model also examined the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect from rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 per cent darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun on the day side for almost two months at a time," explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface for a large part of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story of the evolution of Venus, similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at some time, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapours burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
The results were distributed by researchers from their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy renounces the job of Avalanche's coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the coach of Colorado Avalanche and the vice-president of the hockey team, pointing out the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The vice president / CEO of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as Vice President and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche hockey field with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the vice-president of hockey matters must be fully aligned with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today of his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organisation and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first season of the Avalanche 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and to the victory of the central division, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team hasn't made it to the next round in the last two years.
The Avalanche games in the season 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Wild Card slot of the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame's elected goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
Labour disputes between oil workers in the North Sea due to wages will be postponed when all sides of the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, as the leading negotiators said.
The strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have been arranged randomly on the North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT federations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolving the current dispute," said the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will be holding several full day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year Wood Group cut North Sea contractors' fees by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's commission will result in a 10% reduction in 2014 for contractors in its countries.
The company said that further cuts would provide the company with the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people from its payroll and announced its plans to abandon oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, as the company will reduce its activities as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, a Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with federal leaders to discuss one of the biggest industrial disputes in the North Sea of a generation.
He said the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just for few, both in the North Sea and in the country as a whole," he said in the statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejade constellation.
The most recent task of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the star speeds of the Plejads' constellation.
New data will help astronomers understand why the stars of the constellation rotate at varying speeds, and how the rotation times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star forces, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre in the press release.
The Plejad constellation is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at their top level now.
At its peak rotation speed, these growing stars are feeding large amounts of starry wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, the speed of its rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger of whom make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
In the "Plejade" ballet we see that slow rollers are usually more massive, while the fastest rollers are usually very light stars, "Rebull said.
Since the Plejade constellation is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Plejad constellation offers an anchor to the theoretical models of the rotation of the stars, which include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and so on, hang their 'dancing shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejade rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
