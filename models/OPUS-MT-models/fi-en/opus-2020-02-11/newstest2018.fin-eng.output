Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "People should have a right to their own body"
There are dozens of patient stories hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he was.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
By the process he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to the diagnosis studies of "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the Internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
Translakis, i.e. the law establishing the sex of the transsexual (563/2002) obliges transgenders to coercive sterilisation in order to bring the right sex into the population register centre and passport, for example.
At the moment, each sex repairer is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive failure.
A person has the right to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights", says Auer.
The reform of the Translativa has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and the European Court of Justice is a preliminary ruling which obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change of law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections came and the True Finns came to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes which do not even have anything to do with this law.
"The board does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the board about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland's Department.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
The second consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient history installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolian psychologist at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these he wrote a report that would define the treatment and assistance of Auer's court.
The sense of the reality to be studied appears vulnerable to wavering.
The studyer's perception of himself appears at the border level in a fragmented manner and personality-related unstable features are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these shoots.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
The shock was even greater when Auer was not given sex repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the waiting lobby of the transpol into the television.
Later, that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is named as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove their breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are more than the number of genders defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
For many, the sex repair process is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified for their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many of those seeking the process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these considerations, medical personnel may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
"To prevent treatment and assistance can put a person in a worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, the feeling got easier.
He had finally been able to lyric the feelings that had existed since childhood and in his teens.
Why the broad jaw didn't seem to fit into its own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using your voice and moving," he says.
Now Auer already feels like he's being seen. He exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you get wrong.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and the long research process, however, there can be no formal confirmation of their own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the opposite sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is crystallized by Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art is still important and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organisation issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP for African-American civil rights has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP's Missouri travel notice comes into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state where there have recently been numerous questionable racial events", states the association's release.
The recent law in Missouri makes it more difficult for cases of discrimination to be brought to justice, and the implementation of state law is disproportionate to minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped by color and beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The Missouri travel notice is the first warning for the United States State.
The association mentioned racist comments against African-American students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel and was arrested by Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Justice Minister's report that the police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare, for example, by including money for bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth largest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relations.
The ACLU organisation, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for illegal immigration offences.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but have recently been published by NGOs in response to specific laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintil√§ asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintil√§ (Kesk.) has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo," Yle says.
According to the Minister, it contradicts the state's expression of will.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by the prosperity company emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of remuneration for listed companies' directors.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on the Supplementary Pension of Vauramo in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The government has agreed that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The State owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's principle decision on corporate governance.
The sanctions immediately increased the volume of speech.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be on their way from the cold to the warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted in Russia.
The most stunning response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who said that the Sanctions Act signed by Trump means 'a full-scale trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were to be offset only by political rhetoric and excesses, it is a fact that the tension between the United States and Russia after the brief honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, it was not simple to pass sanctions laws against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress did, however, approve the law with considerable agreement, but the President found it much more difficult to approve the law as stated.
Trump recently criticised the law he signed as "significantly inadequate".
President Trump's splendour must have been due in particular to Russia, although the adoption of the law restricting his own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is being carried out in the United States on Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections as well as on the Russian connections in the Trump campaign.
The tightening of the relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandals have been almost updated, it seems more and more evident that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President but despite the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a kimur in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea will strengthen relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades heavily with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project may be affected.
Acidification in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas ing, for example, important to the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and rigorous.
Otherwise, they can easily be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most secure sign of a change of power is the intervention of statues.
The Americans know this as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief thinkers in Trump's administration, well knew what was going on in a heated debate with the CNN channel Jim Acosta.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the importance of the statue, especially the addition of Emma Lazarus' poem in 1903 ‚Äî 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller raved Acosta: "I don't want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The key are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of their kind, where the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your laid, your Poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The written relief of your theme store."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, and he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" is not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of the broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
After Lazarus ' death, his friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to his statue's pedestal, knowing well that it was a powerful political act.
The statue was designed to express the links between French and American republicanism by a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Putting the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh ‚Äî a mouthpiece that can now be considered some kind of sign of Trump ‚Äî claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives leading the US torch into a world of darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants on the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's definitely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not lead the way but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
Athletics World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made the British national team.
Neil Black, the result leader of the UK Sports Federation, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships on Friday in London.
According to Black, in Scotland "something special is happening", which British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I talked with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Sports Federation, on the other hand, believes that it has something to do with the activities of the Union,
and the British Association of Athletics believes that it is based on their actions.
And a common streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, it is something absolutely wonderful, which is why."
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His Captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and a passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in a 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth World Championships. He thinks it's "incredible" that the national team has 16 scots.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
During the year Laura Muir, a mid-range runner, has run five British and two European records.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London, and you should also keep an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings at the UK World Championships and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scottish on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's "greatly proud" of having so many Scots, some of whom are seriously competing for finals and medals.
"It is a great honour to become a captain anyway, but it is even more special because the captain was voted by the national team members," Doyle says.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They participate as distinguished athletes who compete for awards.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking Reviewers on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, all the way to his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as foolish and silent as sheep for slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge to be unjustified, and his attitude was also trivial online.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many commentators.
But it matters.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic state.
He has received the second best estimates of his operations among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not very responsive to hotheads.
He has led the state firmly and held fast to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users entering the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's website is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, saying that it was only a question of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told us that their comments were respectful, considerate, and proper.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked about hate crimes.
"I politely said that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments on the Washington Post report.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organised group and ignored as a large group of citizens concerned."
The governor's staff called the comments a "centralized attack", and someone else could call them "the promotion of important issues".
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers that had published critical editorials, or arrested and silenced demonstrators.
The real issue, however, is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
He's been sued by Twitter users blocked by President Trump.
The first major decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria District Court, the Loudoun County Government violated the first amendment of the United States Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association had a conversation with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's day, cheap postage had a similar effect to that of the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers scold Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers in which they barked at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions that criticised Jay's agreement, the US-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about 30 places, and also online notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but also from the individual Haapavesi and Sein√§joki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green hairs have died of a tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in wild birds.
In 2009, it went really well.
At that time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green fin stock, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green hairs, but not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, the museum master at the University of Helsinki's Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
The fear is that the last epidemic of green fins will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at the Renaissance Club
Former European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will hold the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament on Archerfield Links, next door, before the last round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and is an ambassador to the tournament on behalf of the founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field."
For the first time, Eales, an Englishman, has defended the championship, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a very special opportunity," says a player living in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil and went on tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"In the home region, playing is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scotsmen: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament, and the car parking costs ¬£5 if there is only a driver in the car, and ¬£10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK cancer organization.
In S√§kyl√§, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were solved
In S√§kyl√§, the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's communications company, at least so far, has not found any indoor air problems, as the Brigade was reported on Thursday.
Further indoor studies will be carried out.
The studies began when the man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought that his health was weakened by the bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified with regard to the health situation of the other armed forces.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that no other person serving in that unit had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The Brigade's release says that due to the arrival in July, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stuffy as a result," Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove for cooking.
Even the boiler is rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato ‚Äì locally "not" ‚Äì directly into the fireplace.
Half an hour later, the sweet potato burned to the ground will be devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
In Degei's home, there are no furniture. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing in murky water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is provided by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to be treated.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot, and soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after five at night," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 villages were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which is holding the region under strict control and preventing foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is isolated and dismal. The trip begins on a one and a half hour flight from the province's capital, Jayapura, to Nabire and continues on a five-hour journey with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the city of about 19 000 inhabitants, wood houses surrounded by bamboos have been stained by rust into yellow browns by corrugated roofs.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the people of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven tweezers, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"Before we had only leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Paniai is a highlands area about the size of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants, only about 100 kilometres from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, for they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and military local units between 1998 and 2004, and that up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 beans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s took on proportions of genocide.
Last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
The report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of 2016 contains stories of previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture ‚Äì rape and electrocutions are particularly popular ‚Äì and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The bolts have been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in search of a better livelihood.
Java food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"The movers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the marketplace at a lower price than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who comes from Pania and moved to the province's capital after work.
"Local women lost their customers."
In his 2014 election campaign, the Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, promised to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential castle of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our wish and restore justice," You says.
Panics experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow's inaugural ceremony in October.
Eleven children were singing carols at a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, and according to the local pastor, Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and Witnesses, drunken soldiers caught and beat children with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of an assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand beanmen ‚Äî young men and women and children ‚Äî met in front of the local police station and the military command center in the football field to demand justice.
They were carrying hunting springs for celebrations, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, which dances in a ring and imitates the bird's song.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers in the internal radio system received a command: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, sensed that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told the Time magazine his brightly colored wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"There were several shots fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," said Yohanes TIME, sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua told reporters that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, publicist of Papua's police in 2015.
"Then it's life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The following day, the news of the killing came to Jakarta.
Three weeks later, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave an emotional speech expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want this case investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his words immediately.
"Most of the violations took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but certain processes are needed to do so," he said.
In an interview with Time magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start the investigation in Papua.
"It's all settled in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of 'crimes against humanity', which relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999.
The families of Paniai's victims view claims with gloomy disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He tells us that he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He reports that he had been abused by soldiers when he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will hunt me down after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood of Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the director refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught by water while fishing on a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire toward the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and for a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live in the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the Beans by random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the directors of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of thousands of people in Pania in the name of "the safeguarding of national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that's too expensive for the locals, too.
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food ‚Äî mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five batat fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihood of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they tend to go to better educated and wealthier local migrants.
Only a few beaners have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The outlying Papua is being overlooked in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were expelled from Papua, even though they had been granted a rare filming permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"There are new risks for journalists reporting on Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces in Papua and West Papua: refusal of visas and blacklisting", Kine stated in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states ‚Äì Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands ‚Äì called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "multiple and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights violations".
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
On 4 May 2017, when an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Ambassador of Human Rights Kees Van Barar, visited Jayapura, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who attended the meeting.
In Indonesia, there are presidential elections in 2019, but the beans tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health care and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the rest of the Beans, regard their votes to Jokow as a "debt" that has to be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of Paniai's shooting once more showed resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," Yacobus says.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks at Robert Helenius for canceling the rematch: "Even your own fans don't want to see"
The heavyweight fighters Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight in Hartwall on May 27.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, sees the reason why Helenius has completely failed to rematch the game.
My fight in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent's fault.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora is rude.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial dots.
The ticket sales of the rematch were slow, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been postponed to autumn.
Since then, there has been no news of the match.
However, Chisora is no longer upset by the withdrawal.
The fight would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My tyr was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on," Chisora says.
The British say they're in about 45 percent condition at the moment.
From what I can tell, he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered the defeat of Whyte in December with a split voice.
Fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames took over the highest residential building in the world in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to flee from a 79-storey building 337 metres high.
This was already the second fire within two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and we woke up with a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai's rescue services, fire - extinguishing forces were able to shut down at four o'clock in the morning local time and were left to cool down the building.
The government announced that they would arrange accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of Directors of the Torch building commissioned a study to find that the boards used to cloak and isolate the facade were the most damaged.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cloaking plates of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
The Joensuu parking lot was stolen between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkam√§entie 2.
The moped was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, discloses survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited items to aircraft past the TSA checkpoints. At least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1 percent said that they had only learned afterward that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
More than a thousand passengers replied to the questionnaire and was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7 per cent of passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules were representatives of the Y generation and less than 15 per cent were members of the X generation.
The rules were most commonly broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking articles with blade on board, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said that they had deliberately taken prohibited drugs on board.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many of the smuggling goods had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelers are also most likely to pass a security check ‚Äî knowingly or unknowingly.
However, as the surveying company states, the TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken into the aircraft and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For a while there was also a belief that books were not allowed on board the plane.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, twisted his decision to delay decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, director of the EPA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under Obama's regime to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency that he is running takes better account of the needs of the state's environmental decision-makers.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
Member States should start to comply with the 2015 ground ozone standard as of 1 October.
In June, Mr Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year, so that his office would have more time to study the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor for the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA Director exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama ruling on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In its opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his turnaround in relation to the ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the L√§nder in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and then waited for the activists and others to sue it to reach an agreement on the timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he sued the Environment Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the public prosecutor of the state of New York, who was the head of the EPA's federal coalition this week, stated that the group was going to continue to exert pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct effects of the smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and District of Columbia.
Land-level ozone is created when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for vulnerable groups of people, which is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure it took to make the guy in charge of our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight against Trump's regime, as its ideological objective is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups."
The supercar manufacturer is coming up with a SUV "events in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive status.
This is likely to happen, but it happens Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said about plans at a press conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of East Savo measles in the same type of virus
Rantasal measles infection is the same type of virus as East Savo's previous cases, reports the THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the Department of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed by a beach salami person on Friday 28 July is of the same type as the previous East Savo cases.
Based on this information, all infections detected in East Savo are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth sufferer, new infections may still appear until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over," says Mirkaleena Erkkil√§, Soster's doctor responsible for primary health diseases.
New measles infections or suspicions have not been detected since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection," says Erkkil√§.
More on the subject: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a legitimate scream
Pontika's soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
In the background, the argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Making a scream at home will be legal next year, but legalizing a moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic in addition to alcohol.
There has been no political will to make the pottika soup a right to every man, commented Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the moonshine was not considered to be legalized.
The issue was not brought to the political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation," says Outi M√§kel√§, Member of Parliament.
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of government parties who took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
You can't even grant permission to distill a moonshine at home in the future.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Importing tells us that the home preparation of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be produced at home by fermentation.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make a scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes requirements for flavours and flavourings and allows the production of a scream, M√§kel√§ specifies.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavouring and flavouring ingredients resulting from their fermentation are clearly present in the drink.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It's still not allowed to be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland," Tuominen believes.
A much greater change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The bill of alcohol law is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will come before the Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, M√§kel√§ rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital with armed guards escorting him.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital because of suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Attridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
The spokesman for the Pistorius family, on the other hand, said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a sixfold Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pushed Mexico to build a border wall
The phone conversations between President Donald Trump of the United States and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been flattened to Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, to stop his public talk about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a literation of Trump's first call to Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Mr Trump said to Mr Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would accept refugees on their way to Australia is 'scaring', 'poor' and 'dirty', and that the agreement negotiated during the Obama period would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant phone call I've had all day."
Georgia's Massacre: Activists reshape racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in the country of Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man squirms.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a reenactment presented on 22.7.2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is put around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-encapsulate the events of 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years ‚Äì even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the restructuring arrangements.
"It's a disgrace of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former congressman from Georgia.
To him, the re-conception is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe's people that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be brought to justice. We want things to finally be concluded, and we want to recover from grief and to make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files from NBC News, over 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motive for lynching has always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, Georgian state blacks were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, at the time of the election, there was an incident in which a black tenant named Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving his wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the town was rumored that Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI records, the powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid off on July 25, 1946, Malcom's $600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and organized the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. They were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks will be more concise.
"It was a right-of-vote murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to the black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade now.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating: it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because we would have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's performance started in June. On the first day, about 30 actors ‚Äî some ten blacks and 20 whites ‚Äî gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the head of the local Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
"I'm gonna feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history should also be displayed so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are practicing their lines.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester's been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Did you not hear me?" I said, "Get off my land, n--"
Rascona or Hester will respond.
And then you hit him.
And then everything (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene's laughing the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally find too fast?" he asks.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the white people used the word n---u at the time."
"That's right," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the sake of the show, but to honor the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are getting out of hand.
No one's laughing.
Recasting ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks with every other word.
About 50 viewers a few feet away are wiping sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Almost half the audience is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a performance in Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks to the graves of the victims in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have turned from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites a crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy murmurs to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors playing lynchers take off their robes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then tears after a tough show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for dinner together.
A white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings she has generated.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and look at the horrible things people say and do that look like you ‚Äì just because they look like you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Recasting is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Harassing vegetables in shops is a source of excitement: This much is actually saved by removing "extra parts"
Is it permitted to remove the cauliflower leaves at the store before weighing?
What about taking off a big hat part of pineapple? It weighs all the time?
The answers strongly share opinions: for one it shows extreme nudity, while others do not want to pay for parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go into the garbage at home.
They'll recognize the phenomenon in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket's vegetable department in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people rip out the leaf parts of cauliflowers, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste from the store.
According to the news published by the financial reports, the shopkeepers are surprised by the snorting at the vegetable counter.
But how much does the removal of excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is this to be?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take off leaves or strains.
Cauliflowers: the price of cauliflowers paying EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80, after peeling off all the leaves.
Ananas: the price of an entire pineapple paying EUR 2.30 fell to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Artichoke Latva: EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short-term stock was cut off.
Sweet mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost EUR 1 and with no stock of 80 cents.
End result: If leaves and strains begin to pluck off, at best a few tens of centimetres will be saved for one vegetable.
In terms of percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
A total of EUR 1.20 would have been saved for these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona. The Brass Star signed a five-year contract with the PSG.
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league, EUR 222 million to buy out.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, costing EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league blocked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the League's rules, the purchasing club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also announced in its press release that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Federation in order to enable it to determine any disciplinary action that might result from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that the PSG's use of its money violates Uefa's rules of economic fair play.
Uefa may be penalised by a company that will lose more than EUR 30 million over a three-year period.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic policy.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an impact on the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with considerable amounts of money, UEFA was announced.
The PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning impact, flash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work on a plane at the Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly lightning struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane into the ground of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said he got electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I'm just asking if he's alive," says Austin's sister Autumn.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and brain hemorrhage.
The experience was hard on the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced a reduction of 3 000 jobs and a 72% reduction in dividends when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Mr Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by ¬£300 million in May as part of his third austerity programme aimed at reviving the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the year unchanged. In the first half of the year, its turnover increased by one per cent and amounted to GBP 2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city, and the authorities say that the attack killed a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured during the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed during the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh area.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "man-held self-made explosive device".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20 per cent were in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in a suicide attack in Kabul, in an area where Shiia Muslims live mainly.
The Taliban reported it was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in the centre of Kabul during the bombing, the country's most devastating attack on the militia after the United States-led forces overthrowing the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also seriously undermined people's confidence in the government, in its policies and, in particular, in President Ghan.
The EPA shall reverse its decision to suspend the implementation of the smog regulations.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) twisted its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under Obama's regime to reduce smog emissions the day after 15 states had sued the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "otson definitions" in 2015 late Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the L√§nder.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone specifications by one year to October 2018. According to these definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Bureau sued 15 states mainly ruled by Democrats, including the District of Columbia, which said that it was illegal to postpone execution.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to alleviate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's era, and Trump says that these measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing of ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures in ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and to take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
Managing Director of Neste: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refinery Fluid's profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year's comparable operating profit was improved by the tax relief of the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in the release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match during their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future for a group of under 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's master of the upper feather series.
On Saturday, Garcia won the first four-weight world champion Adrie Broner with a unanimous decision. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven Saturdays.
When the two posed to photographers, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved higher than the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small-sized man, about six and a half pounds.
I want to get back on the light show.
He has to get on a lightweight [61.2 kg]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the match should be organized on a pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in a lightweight later this year and fight next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in a lightweight Forum on 23 September.
"The match could be on the pay-per-view channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll take it as soon as we can reach an agreement..."
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomachenko as "an incredible fighter" and that he might be going to see the game on Saturday.
Lomachenko stopped complimenting Garcia and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing his punch force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being fought more and more strongly.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was expecting to fight the best. "Mikey's a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary 5 300 euros, training whatever - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and various sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
Tightenings are based on the new MiFID, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements defined in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment firms carry out their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of qualifications for APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, which has experts from both Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both exams are "rare in terms of requirements".
The study materials of the degree include 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, says that the pass percentage of exams is roughly around 70.
Of the employees of the largest banks, about all investment firms have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose staff seem to have avoided completing their qualifications," Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" bankers like this.
According to Savigo, since 2000, APV1 has completed 13 000-14 000 people and more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisors.
Some bankers consider that a degree is an advantage.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is the investment sector competence that will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average earnings for regular working hours of monthly employees are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working for the job earn over ‚Ç¨5 900 a month and women earn over ‚Ç¨4 500 a month.
On average, the tithe of those making the most money earns about 8 100 euros.
The tithe of men who earn the most earns more than ‚Ç¨9 000 per month or more, one tenth of women who earn the most earns makes ‚Ç¨6 400 or more.
Investment advice according to the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, self-regulation has been relied on at the level of employees and tasks.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by FIVA met individual cases where the skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the advice.
In principle, the seller of investment products can also act even if the skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In essence, the situation has been wild and free in this regard.
Several other industries have considerably stricter skills requirements," Savikko says.
According to Savigo, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened up by the new MiFID II Directive.
It requires each undertaking to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial supervision should, in turn, be empowered to determine what needs to be done.
FIVA's market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on the skills and experience requirements of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms and to tied agents selling products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in this outlook during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing training.
All of this must be documented and the company has a duty of proof that this has also been done.
The Court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the staff's positions at individual level.
There will certainly be different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline, if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if the company hires a new employee who does not entirely meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the Court, the change will tighten the rules and make them more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner "drawing" a giant plane over the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was performed on Thursday 787 Dreamliner aircraft, using which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, the plane leaving Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 kilometers, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the United States' borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's tenacious beach swimmers don't lose their rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen pedaled tenaciously with the help of the swimming pool village
Iines Kaikkonen moved at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liett√§ and Lempukka this week and next week.
Although it rains sometimes and then shines again, young swimmers are not bad at all, says Taina Itkonen, the director of swimming schools.
This week's swimming schools have a total of 13 children, 10 next week.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that school and an essay will begin then, assessed Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised jointly by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, Liete beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with swimming tables, someone without a doubt.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first had doubts about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to pedal toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me she went swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the waterfront is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming with the swimming pool village was persistently practiced by Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, four, wanted to go to the water war sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 swimming on the beach, sees the beach swimming school as a good start to learning how to swim.
No matter what the weather has been, Anna has always liked to go here.
I had to warm up once in a while.
The swimmers packed up at the pier.
The boys had a lot to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking fruit and frying the day.
In the water, the lesson went on, but there was no hurry at the pier.
You know, when you don't belong in summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's one of those unifying stories"
You can see all kinds of things.
A couple of days ago, Blue Product, a cleaning product manufacturer, launched the Unknown Soldier product series.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks and a "wc brush on the edge of the brush."
In these autumns, an unknown soldier refers to his premiere film and film marketing.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products are grotesque on social media: When will unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask them what this is all about.
What about Aino M√§√§tt√§, Vice President of Sini Product?
We're the film's partner.
We're here to support this film, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," M√§√§tt√§ says.
According to him, special presentations of the products will be made, and the film will thus be visible.
Isn't there something a little funny about this often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, there is a common story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products," M√§√§tt√§ says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture, M√§√§tt√§ points out.
Other partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichyt have been introduced, which are called Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already made by Kalle Kinnunen, blogist of Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time for further action.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products.
The results of the new Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were published
The latest results of the medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not all consider the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Bureau of Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker more accurately and a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the Finnish Legal Service has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases, the Department of Laws determined that the test was ‚Äòpossibly 18 years of age or older'.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is ‚Äòpossibly under 18'.
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan G√∂ransson of the Department of Legal Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite uniform. There are no significant differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified as over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and indicated that 442 cases had ‚Äòreferences to the fact that the study is 18 years old or older'.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it became clear that 243 cases had been openly reported by the applicant to be 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolininen Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to Metro newspaper.
However, G√∂ransson of the Department of Legal Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "You can generally say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon reach 18 years of age and the risk will be around 10 %."
Joyn collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 sections with a score strip downwards in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
On Saturday, Ilonen left in 11th place, but at the end of the tour, 41 places were found.
In the difficult weather, the joy accumulated with three bogs a double bog.
The others were having trouble too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose up to share one of the top positions in the under-par round, even though he told me that there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung along and eventually the day was good, Poulter thought.
He's sharing the lead with his fellow countryman Callum Shinkwin and Andrew Dodt of Australia.
Governor of West Virginia is changing party
On Thursday night, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at the Trump campaign event that he would change the party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflection... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Governor of the Democrats."
The crowd began to applaud.
"Tomorrow as a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a major announcement would be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of Republicans (RNC) published a statement on Thursday evening stating that "the election of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that prefers to build obstacles rather than better America."
"Democrats only have 15 governors and fewer states than ever before.In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people", Ronna McDaniel, a representative of the RNC, said in his statement to CBS news.
Lightnings sow damage - Thursday becoming even the hardest thunder day of summer
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
Over the past week, thunder has thundered especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck several fires.
According to the Meteorologist, Thursday may be the hardest thunder day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, lightning has been especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
On the dust, lightning struck the electrical center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of a fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The power centre was located in the sauna space at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department disassembled the roof and wall to find the firehouses and put out the fire quickly.
Eleven homes were left without electricity, but personal damage was avoided.
In Loimaa, the lightning set off the outside building in flames on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue service could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An outdoor building about 50 square feet [50 sq m] in size burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in R√§√§kkyl√§, lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department came by to check on the case, but this time the lightning didn't cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway track between Sein√§joki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
On Thursday morning, between 8 and 9 a.m., the train was replaced by buses.
The problem was only resolved shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, rail traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunderstormed section of the line.
Flashes have sowed destruction in various parts of Finland.
However, the lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms of this summer have been absolutely miserable! assessed by Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, on-call meteorologist of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been predominantly moderate in intensity, but with the slight lightning balance of the summer it also seems strong to many.
This might seem like a real thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like this summer's thunderstorm," says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, there were 1,700 skimmings, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer: by around 4:00 p.m., there were 1,790 underground salamas in the plaque.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than 2,000 lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record low thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings in the year was about 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning rate had risen to 18,386 salamics.
So there is still something to catch so that this year does not break the record of two years ago.
But you can expect the Thunderskir to continue.
According to Tuovinen, air mass over Finland will also remain warm and wet during the end of the week, which is a good environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunders is likely to move from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more united rain front in the middle of the country.
That's the kind of thing that Tuovinen says it only thunders a little.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for the doping scandal
The world sports boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Mr Coe added that it was not yet time to put an end to Russia's ban on participation.
At the IAF Congress on Thursday's eve of the World Cup, Dmitri Shljahtin, the Russian athletics director, said that the Russian ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry 'for all the athletes who were stolen from the competitions for gold or silver medals'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from athletic competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA report presented evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Association of Athletics admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on the status of neutral athletes in the World Championships for Sports in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said that Russia still had to meet a number of requirements before its status could be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the trained coaches who were banned continue to operate freely," he told the journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland didn't turn out to be the success that the authors wanted," says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, confess that the film was produced by Helsinki Film's CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100 000 viewers, which is little compared to the film budget, about EUR 5 million.
It's not a lottery win, but it's important now that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been better at home, they would have had their money already.
Now we have to wait for small brooks of foreign distributions," Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The restrictions on the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, which is the most expensive transfer of football players of all time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European football regulator UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair-play economics rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million for the closure of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary for the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer and linking him to its star guard, as the company finances the royal family rich in Qatar's oil.
The clubs are allowed to use large sums of money to buy players, but they need to be balanced with real revenue to avoid loss in football-related business.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, a French president elected in 2007 by UEFA.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that for the first time in 2003 the business model used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period of the financial rules of fair play will last until 2018. During this period, clubs will be allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Even though Platini had to leave UEFA president in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, in charge of fair play financial rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Even though PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may hold the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
As Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, the transfer amount can be recognised as EUR 44,4 million per annum over the next five years.
Based on the financial rules of fair play, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through the company's associated owners.
For example, if a company in Qatar supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual results.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid granted by the Qatari tourist authority to PSG was excessive.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's merits in the PSG could be financed by payments from the 2022 World Football Organization Commission.
However, the PSG and the Organising Commission have denied that Neymar would be the ambassador to the World Cup. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
In view of the past sanctions imposed by the PSG, UEFA will monitor even more closely the attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, available sources reported that UEFA did not negotiate with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorised to discuss the situation of the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of social products and jerseys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar contract.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to be transferred, allegedly violating the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, said to the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state's funding of the football club.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed football's operating environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
We are now in a hurry: Coach of Finnish World Championship athletes stuck in Helsinki
The long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the trio defector Kristina M√§kel√§'s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki even though he should be coaching at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina M√§kel√§ may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow at the long jump qualifier and M√§kel√§ on Saturday at the three-loop qualifier.
However, the coach of the duo, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this issue in Britain's major broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation of World Cup organizers as a documentary, but neither has he been able to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or what, coach director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone at the stadium looked at the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach could be left behind.
A World Championship Medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
Athletics World Championships will start in London today on Friday and will last a good week ending on Sunday, 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the types that Finnish sportsmen and sportsmen can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other indicators.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one prize to another, in which experience is matured to the level that the adult World Championship is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, but there are no bankrupts either.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the attraction and surprise of sport is that miracles can happen.
It pulls bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to follow the games, even though London medals are not settled until late at night due to the time difference.
Finland received one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in athletics in 2015.
It was brought by Spear thrower Tero Pitk√§m√§ki.
Braves expect a medal from Pitk√§m√§ki even now, even though the results of recent times from him and other shooters tell the other story and the fact that Pitk√§m√§ki was left in the qualifiers last summer.
Whatever happened to these games, Pitk√§m√§ki will be a great Finnish sports hero in history.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and belief in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the years to come will give you a good success in the international championships of young people this summer too.
Processing the talents of young people and supporting their work financially is more important than maintaining a small group of elite athletes.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will remain in history because of Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist intimidation or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukaj√§rvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukaj√§rvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second place is Rukaj√§rvi's best big dog in the world cup.
The women's race was won by America's Jamie Anderson.
Rukaj√§rvi collected 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and that was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and I feel good now, but I'm really sorry that the last jump didn't go quite well.
From now on, I'm going to try it again in the games, think Rukaj√§rvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump for the sport.
Viking Line's new express vessel stuck in the harbour in Helsinki
The new FSTR of Viking Shipowners is very late on schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded around eight o'clock.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get aboard.
Now the car queue is moving a little bit, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board at the port of Helsinki, told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical flaw in the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for them to board the ship.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Gr√∂nlund says to IS that there was a technical flaw on the side.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Gr√∂nlund says that the ship will also be late for the return trip to Tallinn for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Route Six on Thursday night
42 meters long special transport from Muuko to Mustola harbour during Thursday night.
The transport leaving at nine o'clock should be there by 11:00 p.m.
The police are controlling traffic on Route Six, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
On the wet side of the road, the transport will proceed along route 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Extractive
At the same time, the story is yearning for both the glory days of the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (about that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State sketches for MTV) and their own time ‚Äì 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars in the series moved on to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant memory that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for some time.
The First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (which included the background story of H. Jon Benjamin's talking vegetable can).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as passionate teenagers approaching maturity, and to highlight it makes the impossible of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodes, for example, 90's stalker movies, such as the horror movie Hand rocking the cradle.
One of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy scheme involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H.W. Bush (acted aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in series like this, the best are side paths.
It's especially funny to see a young man named Paul Rudd, who has a beard tattoo under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles.
The moments of random madness may lift this series into flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer ‚Äì Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to a different nostalgia: the spirit of the Cold War of The Americans, the film Atomic Blonde, and even the wrestling catalogue of the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and is directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-leninism.
In the lead, the hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef are seen in Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubanted in English by Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else.
The series has some good visual jokes (police spend time watching chess on TV the same way the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo√´ Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in imitation of clumsy socialist drama ‚Äì a killer hidden behind a Reagan mask, for example. That's why the show often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might be better served as agitprop satir, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
A message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we gobbled up our own recent history and their history too.
The Kouvola Toni Tauru will rise to the ring in Macao on Saturday against the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru has a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, still fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also wears the black belt of jujutsu and the World Championship of the sport.
For once in my life, I'm fighting a parent.
It's funny. 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were made with a quick schedule in the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macao.
That's never been the case before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It irritated me because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter is pleased, however, that a new time has come for the struggle.
Waiting for a week doesn't affect the preparation much.
The transfer won't affect the condition, because it won't improve in a week.
It could get worse if you practice too much.
In the last few battles, the Tauuru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the fight.
This time it's different.
Issaa Kouvolan describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes hard in the first round and tries to take it to the carpet.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
Kouvola's last fight didn't go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit the Tauru in the corner of the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when I'm standing. He didn't get a shot.
When I went down, he hit me in the eye.
I was really sorry about that for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise more frequently in the ring.
For example, the future opponent, Issa, last fought in September.
Last year, Tauru had three matches.
Now we are facing the second battle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've been working out and in good shape all along.
But the only reason I've ever fought is because of the fight.
When a 32-year-old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good practice with this guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, since on Saturday a Colombian has to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been trained against opponents of the same size, and I've been trained for a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You've got to hit him rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take you to the property myself.
You can't give down for free because they're the ones that consume the most.
Macau attracts a Tauru who fought before in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inexorable and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow and that the bank has moved interest rates because of the increasing pressure on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates at 0,25 %.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that households' income levels would be under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to contain the inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the Bank announced that loan costs could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide preferential funding to banks by means of the Programme of ¬£15 million more than ¬£115 million, a total of ¬£15 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "In accordance with the Commission's forecast for monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as real household income declines in consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "a degree of tightening up of monetary policy" in order to curb inflation in the market's expectations "a little wider".
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and amounted to $1.31 and it weakened by 0.4 per cent and amounted to ‚Ç¨1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after lower than expected growth rates subdued the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and according to the Bank, the situation will deteriorate even further before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" a fall in income in the coming years, but expects that wage developments will recover "substantially" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the shock of the EU's referendum, which plunged the pound down.
The Bank considers that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the Central Bank, interest rates had started to be demanded more and more loudly as inflation tightened the pressure on households. Three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation slowed down to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank it was expected and inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess over its target level of 2 % was due to a ‚Äòtotal' weak pound.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be increasing as creditors are feverishly looking for customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market is looking particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to end. Repurchase agreements are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also untapped options."
NHS prescribes to 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Since September, patients may be prescribed a ‚Äòreversible' anti-HIV medicine, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the financing of the medicine in the UK public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of the trial and that the pre-interval drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP medicine, although it claims that it should be financed by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, director of the UK NHS, referred to the decision announced on Thursday as "substantial new intervention", and the National AIDS Organisation described it as "an important moment of resolution".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an anti-HIV medicine taken prior to sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of transmission.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in high-risk groups.
A medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection during sexual intercourse.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates for the trial from men, women and transgenders, as well as from those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and registered for the care of a general practitioner can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and this week the UK NHS signed a contract for medicines after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, uptake and treatment implementation.
"This important new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV", Stevens says.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the struggle of over 30 years to solve one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV", says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Agency.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those in need and at risk, it can have a revolutionary effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, risk groups will receive a drug that they can decide on independently without the need to negotiate with a partner through an NHS-funded experiment, which will have a powerful effect which will improve the lives of very many people.
This is welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one at risk is excluded," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used for testing has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that took a long time for many months because of the government's slow-down," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get another step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been halted."
Quality of living: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was excited about the renovation of the properties, moved from the Knightsbridge neighbourhood to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house of the style of Queen Anna's era, and the success of the renovation is that Joanne has not yet packed up and moved.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment display and found that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I fell in love immediately and made an offer the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square feet [90 sq m] has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-bedroom where only the kitchen could get into the bedroom. Joanne wanted more storage space and a middle floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to exploit the space of nearly four metres high rooms and create an apartment that was not just a renovation and sales site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where you could stand.
Erfan's solution required creative thinking.
"The steel structures are quite complicated.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be adapted so that the height is just right on and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-level rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the interlayer opens the copper cross-section window of Retrouvius in an elegant lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage luminaires create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricism, feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to the other room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
To add to the style, you can hide the kitchen when you don't use it.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution.
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan says about a steel reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily into place."
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and a better layout.
"When selling a property, the area determines ‚Äì or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In principle, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The dwelling is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional connection to the dwelling is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one's attached to electrical wires running through the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptional.
Then it can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiated in her summer dress
Princess Sofia's choice of costumes hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B√•stad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B√•stad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body-like outfit that was the last to dress a pregnant princess.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event in which Sofia will represent her birth.
His due date is September.
Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastell blue dress for dinner, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastelin blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been to B√•stad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia was just glowing in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited about talking to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and pointed to her late pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Market, where Thai food was sold.
They didn't have the guts to taste it. They just walked by.
In the booth, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttil√§, among the acquaintances Panja.
He didn't know much about Finnish and Finns didn't know any Thais at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Gulfs to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Try some, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in Lahti.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by in the shopping hall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said that the self-made pastes smelled too much in the hall.
There was a new location at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we jibbers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times will we shyly ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows her clients.
He'll be told where we've been and who we've seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat the first spring wrapper.
She remembers me thin and fat, and she remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to have lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own seat next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we can get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened up our thoughts and hearts.
Many now speak Thai to him thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though she's had a hard time, she's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On the restaurant work, he goes to the mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating its two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day went by in front of the job.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, the security authorities received an important list for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains information from more than 170 Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also images of everyone.
More than 130 of the persons mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Night Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have become more accurate.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorists' identities and pictures while investigating the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
In the background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
There's also a list of specific areas of expertise for terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads the title Abu Assid al-Almani, which is German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later through Turkey to join the ranks of ISIS.
His photo is written next to a suicide bomber.
There's no more accurate information about the man's fate.
In total, some 6 000 fighters from Europe have taken up the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank beneath the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to the interviews with the Rescue Department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, a person under water was rescued.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter on call at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The bailout diver found him under the surface," says Estlander.
The rescue department received a report after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was placed in the hands of the paramedics.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
They also provided excellent guidance to divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars hit nine people in Eura, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom were less injured, says the firefighter on duty.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The crash occurred when another car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the firefighter on duty.
According to the Rescue Department, there's a 50-mile-an-hour speed limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate property
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, which is linked to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Torahk value zone just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there that expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying force of the family and the central figure".
According to court records, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was dealt with for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
Now the brothers are also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says that this is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor treatment of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first oaths that he would like to find a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing for me," Colin says in his statement.
There are hundreds of pages of depositions, e-mails and reports about the case. The case is being investigated by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as by the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacies in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a real estate in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started a store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court", Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. Colin says that Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "the bitterest of the economic terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, even though he is a former member of the Australian Football League Club Board and the best friend of TV star Eddie McGuire according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and in his text message he told me he couldn't really comment on it because it's being tried in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be resolved in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new head of staff is planning to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House's new head of staff plans to restrict the media use of President Trump and the monitoring of the news so that the boss doesn't get in so many trouble.
Reported by journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit the information available to President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information, both printed and heard at press conferences, must pass through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of television relations ‚Äì and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If President Trump was upset about unfair news, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media dealt with matters more fairly," Sam Numberg, who worked as adviser in Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
The politicalo journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at that time that "six former campaign workers say that it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praises".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know ‚Äì maybe Trump's tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has at least a few times been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing the fuss.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to pursue their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable ‚Äì or not.
In May Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about an incident:
"The current and former workers of Tramp say that he can be enraged by press games in which he is criticized ‚Äì especially if they tell about harmful leaks of information. Then he is absolutely forced to know where the information comes from.
That's what happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on the GotNews.com website, founded by Internet promoter Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started after reading the article asking the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the White House's Secretary of Staff, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he proves to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to pursue their own business.
These unchangeable facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
The Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five - year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a player in the Spanish league, EUR 222 million to buy out.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved and was free to move to the Paris Society of PSG.
The dizzy sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, Manchester United had a record, costing EUR 105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar company.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The success writer Raija Oranen beat alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the right shape of my life"
From the TV series Rose's time and clean white sheets known as success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
The hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren hold Grandma so in their grip that Raija and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring there was also a rental apartment.
In light and the sun, out of the old circles, Rajan was once taken by depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
Even the outer nature is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medication was stopped, they were antidepressants.
I was helped by hypnosis, which also worked on fear of flying, and I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling together for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in tourism, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, and Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama she's always been, ending her life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a major career as a writer, only remembers a 44-part clean white sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work in the clothing industry of the fresh family company when I read Liisa Sepp√§l√§'s 50-year interview on board.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I was a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it," Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time; she has many manuscripts under work - ideas of hundreds.
The orbiters returned across the ditch to the "millionaire alley"
One of the wealthiest house owners in West Midlands is once again on the hairline with the persistent wanderings who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the adjacent field.
Tourers parked about 20 caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat they needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused the Solihull municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reports that the Travellers arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"The municipality needs to be toughened to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
More came in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travellers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them, and they have even laid a horse in a grazing park."
According to the spokesman for Solihull County, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the gathering of evidence that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activities to the police.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry People Surrounded Portugal's Accident Machine
In Portugal, men who have made an emergency landing on a beach full of people have been questioned today in court.
Two people died yesterday as a result of an emergency landing.
Two men who have flown a plane can be charged with involuntary death.
The longest it can be, you can get 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, due to a technical malfunction, a man - flying small plane had to make an emergency landing on the shores of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran away from the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who was on his back.
Immediately thereafter, the plane rose up and as it landed again, it hit the child's head, told the magazine Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who got killed was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents weren't hurt.
The beachers surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began beating its ass, reported Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash landing.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his foot won the World Cup again: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland's time for the World Cup at the big white competition in banked slalom in Canada early Wednesday morning.
The Great Hamari also won the World Cup gold in the past.
A total of three World Cup titles have already been accumulated.
I can't believe the World Cup!
Twice we were treated for gold, with a pretty good heart rate we were pulled, with the phone reached by the Great Hamari was happy.
The 30-year-old calculator thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Great Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are getting smaller and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
She had been eagerly counting with her friends since she was young, and the accident did not take away her desire to get on the slope.
You know, it reminds me from time to time, what my life would be like if it wasn't for that accident.
But my attitude has always been that if you don't mind.
Those cards are played, which is shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to look at a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a lucky kick, and the Great Hamari will not do so.
But he turned a terrible difficulty into a favor.
Yes, I would say that the situation has turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamar's greatest passion for surfing was already waning.
My job to the top didn't start until after the accident.
When I was a kid, I used to work out with my friends, and we were always so excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in that X-Games startup.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and get bitter and sad."
I decided to pull my overalls on and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded his prize at the sports gala in January.
According to the Great Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for the parasports people.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch the sportsman campaign of the year of the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see about that.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Yet the Great Hamar has not conquered all the peaks he coveted.
Next year will be a major goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
They're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump regime is not seen to bring about a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication office chain Burson-Marsteller studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the survey.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents could think of returning to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and by the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return, while a quarter feel that the most important factor would be the departure of ISIS from the country.
Only less than one-tenth will make the most important factors affecting the decision an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not solve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important to end the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter sees the presidency of al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
The only way to resolve the conflict is through military action.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS's power weakened over the last year, while one fifth sees it strengthened.
According to the defendants, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS and terrorism in general is that the media should provide people with information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people made military measures and education reform a priority.
In the view of just a tenth, the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of Trump's regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's regime.
Almost one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's reign.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia's involvement and Iran's involvement has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed is used by, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a company in Espoo, is developing an open source database that is "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder Michael "Monty" Widenius, is no cost to users, and it can be developed online by any good programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses will remain in order and quickly available.
If you use, for example, Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the technology leader of MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen helps to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and one year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun with $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced that they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a certain promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB at this stage.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun's top 20 developers to make sure that the continuity of the code is secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"In the course of MySQL, these assurances were not made," Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"The last few years our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqval√©n, financial director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqval√©n is short-spoken about the company's key figures.
To this extent, she reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates to receive EUR 20 million in orders.
As the database is free, the company has developed around it services that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be over a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in no time because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telef√≥nica and the largest bank in South-East Asia are the paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqval√© lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oraclelle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the research company Gartner claims that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still negligible, albeit rapidly growing seals.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not reach even $1 billion.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users pay nothing for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open databases or the transition would at least have started.
Large companies do not get new customers because most of them will choose the next open source code.
This has resulted in the licence fees for commercial databases being skyrocketed.
The companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius says.
Since the exchange of a closed database is burdensome, most customer companies have swallowed price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer's size is about to be reached.
When licence fees increase each year, the customer will sooner or later enter the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies face major systemic changes in the way they transfer their activities to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth finance ever provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now seeking to recruit more.
One of the reasons for EIB's funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe is paying billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," says Paqval√©n.
Widenius is saddened by how money is spent on closed healthcare systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it is a better way to make a code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot or cannot do.
In addition to another Finnish developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models over open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy is increasing its attitude towards non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean Sea that they should not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs are not committed to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German ship of Jugend Rettet, a crew suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
Only a year's aid organisation refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area", the organisation announced in a statement published in social media.
"We can only judge the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Since October, the Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who had re-use of the boats.
One such incident is claimed to have taken place just a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, as indicated by a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who will supervise the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to comply are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Frontiers.
Mr Minniti, for his part, said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy as a result of the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He revealed that there are plans to continue this month's discussions with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
A seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner on Enontekio, suspect found in the terrain - a case for the prosecutor
The suspected crime was committed in Kuttanen, Enonteki√∂, last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has been reported in the past that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect, after what he did, would have fled with two dogs into the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist the capture.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, who is famous for Harry Potter and all-haired friends, is dead.
Robert Hardy, the British girl, is dead when he was 91.
The actor's death was reported by his family on Thursday.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his acting career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in a series of all-haired friends based on James Herriot's book.
In total, the BBC's popular series was filmed through seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that she was considered to have induced her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the sentence and was allowed to wait for the application to be examined in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy sweater, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a tearful look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was caused by "stricken circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. read the testimony of Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, who told her that "not a day goes by that I won't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this. I will do my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that he is "stalking" about the idea that he will never see his brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never let go," Camdy said.
There seems to be a precedent for this case, since there is no law in Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter, in his text messages, had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Shide yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many customs," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before he died. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts' opinions.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
"Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: The worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working in such a way that tensions do not become strained.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump of the United States was able to see that the relationship between the United States and Russia has even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for bad relations between the countries to be welcomed by Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The CEO of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown, Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to the engines of over 3 million Mercedes in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
The use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States has been heavily marketed by European car manufacturers in order to achieve the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emissions neutralising equipment will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of supporting large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to the prescribed level during tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the manufacturer of luxury cars has a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The Venezuelan vote started a fraud investigation, big protests were coming.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election results, as Tibisay Luceanan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a controversial vote was held with a delegation to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed their own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began to take over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are meant to ensure the safety of the appointmentist.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in the south of France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease - carrying insects, and researchers and farmers are working very hard to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is threatened by the effects of climate change in the Provence region in recent years, which has led to a marked reduction in rainfall in spring, especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence, which specializes in agriculture.
"This will shorten the life span of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area, which spread micro-bacterials."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desired ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed, weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are less and less essential oil components."
The solution is sought by stepping up irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and injecting plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and by developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist represents a growing threat in Mexico
The weekly edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been advised to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: to leave the children at home or to include them in a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking journalists for names for each group.
They write the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make Mexico's chaos a threat to the news.
According to the Journalists' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto took office in December 2012. Under federal protection there are 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened. In the current year at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
The front of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing his middle finger. It says, "Judge". The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a panama hat made up of trademarks.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death and journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular for the handling of journalists' cases, but to date, according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two cases have been brought.
Journalists' murderers rarely go to court, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime each year, only a few end up in court.
The journalists of Riodoce intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the capital of the State in Culiacan on 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. Supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the 18th river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was saddened by a wife and two grown children.
Rumors move fast and squirm freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is still silent.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and there are two - story, decorative tombs of drug lords that are larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who runs a rival group that is waging a war against the Guzman boys.
The Guzman boys may have been pissed off by this case: every issue of the magazine was purchased by customers suspected of being members of the gang as soon as the magazine came to the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same article was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when, in 2003, he decided to set up Riodoce with five colleagues. The magazine shares were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem", Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its newscasting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Journalist Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Journalist Protection Committee prize.
The drug trade is in Sinaloa "lifestyle", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The supplier must accept the task that falls upon him ‚Äì or act foolish.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here ‚Äì why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez ‚Äì a joker who cursed like a port worker ‚Äì and they miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, and they miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He visited the El Guayabo bar across the street from the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were the end of him.
The death of a colleague has also led them to wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the story," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression may be misleading, and so it happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40 - degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four - story building in the middle - class Culiac area.
Some journalists were half-played about whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state considered unreliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
The boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that government spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the D.A.'s office, had a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official record of who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Power-driven Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), who has dominated Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, one of which "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid military raids.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would provide reliable information about the abduction.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco", Ohukainen, because of his slender body structure.
"Now all communications with our informants are down."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists have been kept, and the workers in the newspaper have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took along a few signs the following morning when she left for a demonstration before the local prosecutor's office, which was caused by another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a body was found burned, which, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations on sidewalks and buildings, "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked for him to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists were surrounded by organized crime, crime - permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were from the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a crippling effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the border state of Tamaulipas in the north six years ago.
There was a note signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut-off head was his computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a note to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's reporters sat in front of the delivery at midnight on the sidewalk on a beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly their phones began to vibrate as a signal.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlan's beach resort, 19 people had died.
The war accelerated, as promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be redoed the next day.
The sirens were howling nearby ‚Äî another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
if they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where a man gives a finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about quitting. "How am I supposed to shut down a magazine when our intern asked me to do a story on the street the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, the celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, were short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
That was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May was practically all gone when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a child's disease, such as an ear infection, to which I had to take an antibiotic course.
I was able to make only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was tough when I couldn't make use of my training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
The test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion received the training permit only in the second week of June, which was reflected in the competition and top sports research centre KIHU's roller mat test of 12 June.
In the test, an athlete skis with roller skis on a carpet with a speed increase every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester uses a needle to sample the lactic acid.
Last fall, I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
Came up against the wall, Manninen says.
‚ô™ For the better ‚ô™
After the understatements, Manninen tells me he's been healthy.
I have done many peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week period back there.
It was also a week and a half away from flying.
I had plenty of time to go to the cabin with my family.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manninen rose to 18th on top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have made an exercise and competition plan until next February.
Now we're looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have three world Cup Games weekends.
In December, it would be meant to be at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still have to be made to participate in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team's list," Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth winter Olympic Games already in his career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 the gold in the team competition celebrated the Nummel's emphasis.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by disguise
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first results of a creature the size of a rhinoceros found by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was red-brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists view this amazingly well - preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock and decided to examine his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
For six years, the wild beast was dug up in a 300 - pound [100 kg] piece.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Studies in leather revealed that meat - eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red - and - white armor masked its predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter coloring from the top, which still exists in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaurus came to the headlines in May and is now on display in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a Mark Mitchell museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, where the body is darker on top and lighter below.
However, the observation was a surprise, since Borealope is considerably larger than the present animals with the same coloring.
It suggests that meat - eating dinosaurs caught it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding instead of fighting as a means of survival.
For example, deer, zebras, and armadillos have the same coloring from existing animals, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The hunting of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Age were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the scales of the Nodosaurus' organic compounds reveals that its skin was red - brown.
Scientists continue to study the Nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its bowels to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Researchers believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted to the sea, where it sank back into the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas likely went far beyond what they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has survived and has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous Age.
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The Cretaceous Age was the Age of Therods, the huge bipeds, the flesh - eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years before Borealopetta, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armored dinosaur.
One of the predecessors of Tyrannosaurus Rex was the Acrocanthosaur, a six - ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology. They believe Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011, and found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with skin and armor from snout to hip.
Nodosaurus averaged five metres in length and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two-foot-long spikes were raised from their blades.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in little detail in an underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in tank - holed plates along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it seems.
There's still fossilized leather on the bumpy plates of that skull armor.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate the scales of its sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had come to New York one day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on the bed, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed. That's why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis, who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, and the white police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he got back on Twitter later that night, people were told that people were gathering at Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police's tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was wearing a sign that said, "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of protestors with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop arming his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers saying.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've already gotten used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock in the evening and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years, a documentary entitled "Whose Streets?" was made. It was premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter in a flower dress and a crown that was compatible with it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't stop taking my daughter with me," Ferrell later told me.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow into it.
He must have the capacity to act and organize, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black. And he must know what we must do to be liberated, to free ourselves.
Although fortunately I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still similar to the rest of the black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a campground for activists, waiting for information on the case and finally learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he says. While studying at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the association of minority nursing students. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organization.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrelli's suspicions slipped into his mind, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually white people, had appeared in the local community who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had no voice in common," Folayan recently told us in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism with prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrelli to join the project together with six other locals. The film group followed the events during the years that followed Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are presented in a movie because I'm being played the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrelli's experiences because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not about charismatic leadership but about the community".
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells how it felt to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and filming of black people requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrelli's story goes on and brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders identify with the Queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he points out that Ferrelli was not selected for "self-intentional" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson long ago, but there is still tension between the community and the police.
Ferrelli still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the highway at a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political climate in his neighbourhood is brief and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he memorized on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with white, black and brown faces, between which you can see more closely the resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served 35 years in prison, sentenced for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a transatlantic and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama relaxed on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit a little theoretical, comment on the customization of DNA data, ambiguity and the causality and identity underlying the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, named Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, where a troubled manning sits in a car in the driver's seat.
Dewey-Hagborg had a very popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it he created portraits based on forensic data, and he received DNA data from, for example, cigarette butts and gums and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us about a new exhibition at a press conference.
You couldn't get a visit to Manning and you couldn't shoot him in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked him if he was interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became pen pals, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even wrote together the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which described the future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and would be able to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, which was a fortunate coincidence after seven severe years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leaks and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divides he was actually supposed to ease.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all things have meaning."
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's great autograph, where the last name's point is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters ‚Äì or nucleotide, as the artist uses a scientific definition ‚Äì Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. His Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the comic book Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," the picture says.
"Never shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get chills."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he will be greeted by a face based on his own genetic data as a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were once on the wall, but I wanted to make a crowd feel like them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects in murder.
Police report that they have launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury residence in Chicago.
The Cook County Court records show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued against Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident, and the stabbing is being investigated as murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In a statement e-mailed by Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President responsible for social relations at the University, Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the university and somerville College's spokesman by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in every possible way."
The opinion also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we constantly focus our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
He reported that the police received a call from a manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in 1008.
The police described the scene as a terrible sight.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Board of Directors published the following notice to the residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill the Muslims" in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," said the convicted officer.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them in on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was captured when he called the police about threatening him.
Threatening wasn't about what happened at the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookshop events, said the police spokesman.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the cops in interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay ¬£620, or approximately ‚Ç¨690, for legal costs and ¬£85, or ¬£95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will bring the WADA road map to a conclusion in the near future" ‚Äì Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the activities of the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the road map measures have already been taken and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD of the British Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points in the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study conducted by a Canadian lawyer named WADA, Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the alleged role of the State in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, president of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial opinions and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop drug control in Russia in November 2015, when the extent of the drug scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of the innovation that is dear to Finns: The health benefits of maternity packaging "there is no evidence"
The British organization questions the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
The BBC and the Guardian, among other things, report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDS, bans the use of its own brochures in UK maternity packs.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
A SIDS means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in British health authorities in the safe sleep of a child.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them, because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand born.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure," said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packs are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been granted free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various items, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard as a place to sleep in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging can be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no crib or cot available.
The organization recommends using the package only for naps and stopping it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and ensuring that they do not get wet or soiled.
The fast villain ran away from the Japanese zoo for the second time.
The staff at the Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has run away for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane told us.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about three feet long.
Yamane describes a fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villains are allowed to travel freely in the farm area.
The zoo hasn't had any witnesses to the turtle.
The last runaway trip by the bad guy happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber's mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her online store start-up business, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can do surveys and target certain teams and population groups and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the board of directors.
"Your health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company's Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint-startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says that he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to make quick inquiries and votes for certain teams, and it can be used to draw up a map that shows at a glance which departments are the most discontented and which of the leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil ever since a former employee wrote in his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, could reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. The interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was hit.
Convertworld has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convertworld allows companies to make tailor-made inquiries, collect answers confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if there's any reason to suspect the director of the company's indiscretions, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"General opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convertworld.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations. The company has used Convertworld for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the telephone number or email address that could make the notification to the head office. Then he had to file an official complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Legal Director of Ruby Tuesday. He said that it was difficult to follow the complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems were hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related trials."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after Arthur Andersen, an audit firm, collapsed as a result of unethical action in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with the social media that the companies realised that they could no longer prevent public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convertworld offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convertworld have venture capital investors to support them.
In February, Convertworld raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised $47 million in capital.
Glint received ‚Ç¨10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investment is not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and risk capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely useful business.
"The employees will be more committed to the company's success if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of Personnel Remuneration and Welfare at LinkedIn.
Investors get profits when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that investors are interested.
According to the experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if it does not lead to action.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand debates," says Russell Raath, CEO of the management consulting company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on mere gathering of information.
"If the company fails to take action, the employees will start to wonder if they were heard.
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting personnel surveys on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is announced in Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated employees on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to change teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of its staff in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses its employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of ensnaring his naked female neighbour, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she had noticed outside her window a cell phone hanging at the end of a rope.
According to the woman, her cell phone's camera was in the apartment.
The frightened woman had run into another room to get dressed.
After the woman arrived to check on the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but was counted shortly thereafter in the window again.
A 20-year-old man who's been a suspect in a covert shooting has admitted to filming a woman.
But he claimed he only photographed a woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed and the police had failed to return it to evidence.
In the hearings, the man has admitted the act, but has denied himself guilty of the crime.
The man's description was justified by the fact that he loves his neighbor "unreally crazy".
According to the news agency, a man is being charged with a case.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed," said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
A temporary cut of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the examination would not in any way involve the cuts in holiday money.
In the municipal sector, contracts are expected to arise only after private sector papers are signed and the percentages of increases are known.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luukkainen did not reveal yet.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-skilled negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cutting increases earnings differentials
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of employees in the public sector, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, the temporary cut in holiday money further exacerbates the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weak are growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The length of the day for the Bruins players was prolonged by the reduction of the number of daily exercises by the NBA from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA football players have been left to talk to on the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs shine out of sweat after the first day of training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training, the university's summer classes return to finals at the dormitory. The next morning they meet at 6:30 at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Jim Mora, coach of Bruins, says a little before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The umbrella organisation of university sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the workload of players, but it has extended their days ‚Äì at least until Friday, when the final finals will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three exercises started at 15 after 7 pm. It was hard to find room for players already on full schedule.
This year the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood Coach season, which has continued through Mora six seasons, when training is being held at the same time as summer courses.
Practices are scheduled to take place 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA meets Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says that she supported the change in the rules of the NBA, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them up a lot for three or four days, and that is very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes rehearsals from outside after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs over the safety net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins players are to move to the hotel for the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video from there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
There's a lot of money being paid for the video of the rehearsals.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to overwhelm my head.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will take place in Central African Rwanda, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing his third term, but in practice he has had an influence on the management of the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kagame will be able to pursue a constitutional change that limited the presidency to two.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly held leader.
During his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in bringing together a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African countries.
Kagame too, however, has promised his people more freedom after the earth has been lifted on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up the inspection of facts
Facebook intends to send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers more and more often and present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest distributors of fake news. Many people feel that fake news affected the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has arisen in a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with fake news before the presidential election in May and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, will support the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, in a separate statement published in Germany, Facebook announced that fact checks are being carried out in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screening of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide more about what they read and share," Sara Su, Product Manager of Facebook News Feed, wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Origin of a comic book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scottish castle in the county of Kent is now known as Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now, in a charming location in the Bewl Valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I love to be able to study the text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago," Rhodes says sorely.
"I feel a personal connection while holding the letter in my hand."
The Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edvardian Times. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared from Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because then fire was used as an illumination.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
The author, attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the British National Art Council, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent days studying Victorian "new" castles, archives, treasures and raritys, such as hyena heads hanging on walls and bottles in moats for centuries.
He traveled around the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with the rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also the artists who pictured the book.
In the evenings, he took whiskey and started writing.
Scotland's closer history is quite unknown, since the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation's staff were just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything else to the attic.
The archives contained journals, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here families fought for even one birch.
It occurred to me that I think we should let it go."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, about a man who will soon join the English peasant bishop in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex states that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant monkey started in the same area, and it occurred to me that rebellion could start in a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle ‚Äì such as The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The family's men seem to have been quite a bunch of guys who got into debt all the time and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as handsome friends who could court an heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Lifehill, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, where only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotland Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn day."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working in such a way that tensions do not become strained.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump of the United States was able to see that the relationship between the United States and Russia has even fallen to a dangerously bad level.
Mr Trump called for bad relations between the countries to be welcomed by Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitchko stops the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
Professional boxing long-term heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitchko ends his career.
Klitchko, 41 in Ukraine, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klitchko, who struck gold, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitchko lost the last two matches of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitchko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in the 11th round after a wild fight.
Joshua and Klitchko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitchko, however, found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game, Klitchko explained in his release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Check Klitchko's reasoning for his decision on the video.
Bernd B√∂nte, the manager of Klitchko, said in the press release that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitchko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he does not have enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Mr B√∂nte said.
Since 2009, Klitchko has been dating an actor in the United States named Hayden Panettiere.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitchko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the various unions at the same time.
The weatherbreaker in Finland is under the conditions: "Exploring the feeling"
The pole jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman's mood away.
Even the London World Cup has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been in this summer's summer against Minna Niksta, the pole jumper.
I hate to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been racing and practicing here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place," Nikkanen told me at Paavo Nurmi Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds at the rehearsals," Nikkanen said at Kaleva's competitions.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging getting the technology together, whether it's cold stuff or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken my breath away.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy under bad circumstances.
Thanks to his hangar jump of 455, he got into the World Cup.
There's been 445 out there.
It's not the same in London for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday at the qualifier 460.
Why don't you move to work abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the early days.
I got the jump together and the tech standardized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've been able to get to the hangar and practice. Now the hangar's closed.
What would be the ideal way to compete?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
A little wind will do just as long as it's constant.
"We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipil√§'s government must keep ice in its hat and be careful not to overwhelm the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there's no room for division.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 in Wednesday's First Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, politicians' proposals, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, have been raised by Virtanen as election speeches.
They mainly indicate that elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no margin for division now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about a dealer when you're in debt," Virtanen said to Yle.
Mr Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 as a budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget and Budget Manager.
Last time he retired, he served as Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the projected growth rate of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a thorn from which we are going down next year, and Finland is facing an increase of one per cent for decades.
Washington amends the rules on permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants who know English and who are able to support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy will benefit from the new application process."
The spouse of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret were photographed in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, says the Court of Denmark.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King's House has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court notes in its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been displeased with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, court communications director, commented in the newspaper.
The prince's decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his mate.
According to the Court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of her mate for the burial site and understands the decision.
Tragedy on the road: The car almost came on the highway
Tom had a common-law husband and two small children on board.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they won't get the insurance money if the other party isn't reached.
The accident occurred at Keimolaport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa reports that her family had miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and two small children of the couple drove on the motorway at Keimolaport in Vantaa towards H√§meenlinna.
A white car, which almost drove the family car to the side of the car, drove along the acceleration lane from Ring III to the H√§meenlinna bus," Tommi says.
If it wasn't for evasive action, Tom would've brought the car.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the backseat were not injured.
One child is just under three years old, the other under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky nothing happened to us.
No one passing by even drove toward us, even though there was a busy traffic.
The accident occurred about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue department staff showed up and the family was checked out.
The car went into redemption.
Tom tells us that he and the common-law spouse have a small income, and they received family allowance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information on the second car, Tom says the family won't get the insurance money.
That's why the family wants eyewitness sightings of the car that drove the family into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to kindergarten and work without it," Tommi says.
Tom saw the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or the early 2000s.
He thought the license plate of the car was the start of the SIG.
If we can't catch the guy who did this, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every cent today.
Tom hopes that anyone who has seen what has happened or knows something about it will be connected to the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and article were fixed at 9:15: Contrary to what was originally said in the case, the second car, according to Tommi, did not come into the band of those who came in, but almost drove from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Lotta J√§ppinen's performance deals with human relationships by means of humor - The self-expressor will be seen at What?-theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta J√§ppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born guidance to the Who? theatre.
The self-expressor is a musical theater performance about past relationships and inadequateness.
According to Director Lotta J√§ppinen, it still makes me feel good.
The subject is dealt with by means of humor.
You don't get caught up in bad feelings, he says.
According to J√§ppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges one to consider what a person reveals about himself when getting to know a new person.
Is he playing a role or is he approaching the other coat open?
A plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
J√§ppinen has both guided and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal is made up of the working group's texts and does not have a plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
J√§ppinen points out that the self-expressor does not directly tell about his own relationships or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixing.
I'm sure my world of values cares about the show.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I do not think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
J√§ppinen believes that the self-detector is drawing a timely picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
He says that many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea L√•ng, Niklas Raut√©n and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
The musical arrangement is J√§ppinen's and Roka's.
The love of the theater came to light in Kouvola
Lotta J√§ppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies theatre expression as director at Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
There's two years behind you, and there's another one ahead.
J√§ppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The music classes have been raised as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in steering.
The self-expressor got his premiere last week in Helsinki on Narr's stage.
A performance of about 45 minutes should also be seen in the future at least in J√§ppinen's study town in Turku.
Self-expressor at Kouvola's What? Theatre on 4 August at 7 p.m. and 5 August at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - the neckline was broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
For 20 years, the ace of the Kumpareland was going around the world for hundreds of days a year, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement continued in Lahtela.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new," says Lahtela.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds at my house for a year," says Lahtela.
The bribe had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't go for boundaries with it.
It's just so tough as a sport, it's not worth doing too much for a 40-year-old like this!
After the accident, Lahtela found herself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long run as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
He started his job right after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much of anything," says Lahtela.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged her prot√©g√© in slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't make sense either.
Not even among the species.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoyed it because for once in my life, I just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the main coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll burn out.
It's easier to find places in the body that have broken apart than in the unbroken!
If it hadn't been for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started coaching the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
About the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the Speed Races.
I traded Motocrosss for Frisbeegolf!
It just got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Mr. Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not insist that his coaches be like him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it," says Lahtela.
The sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It is here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry ‚Äì just when it had begun to feel that 2017 could no longer become weirder.
Yes, sir.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
"We need to start taking the generalisation of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey of Sheffield University, the founder member of the Foundation and professor of emeritus in robotics and artificial intelligence.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are scurrying, but they are already selling quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls into robots with the appearance of warm silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot's own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, perhaps shy.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It could be tired, talky or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot, for example, designed to be shy and resistant.
True Companion compares Roxxy robots to a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at the same time as women's rights are being threatened around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has boasted that he has harassed women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, such as pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly short.
Trying to make sex robots as much like real women (with the dimensions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They have no will or history of their own ‚Äî nothing that points to independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, led by the head of ISIS
The head of the extreme organization ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb onto an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures in ISIS had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
According to suspicions, the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and to take it to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were captured in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will continue.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a picture of common sense.
During Trump's period, it has already been repeated to the point of getting tired of the fact that the strong division of voters has also disbanded families at everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers gave advice on how to get along with the relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Trump's ability to unite families has been overlooked.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, and he's a left-wing poet living in Chicago who's long been a button against the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all know ‚Äî including the Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing over politics for decades ‚Äî are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table it is a good thing, but in the broader sense it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left-wing power, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to be terrified of his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the Republicans on the right extreme, who suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
Looking back on Mitt Romney's subdued version of madness: dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and at least his tax returns we've seen).
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate will only have to be clear-headed, and it will immediately seem like a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Carousel of Central Park, the biggest carousel in the park department in New York City, and the best thing you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Carousel's horses are huge, the characters in the middle ‚Äî grotesque clowns and animals in terror ‚Äî are ominous, and the music behind it is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's features become disillusioned over time: the view of tall buildings is getting bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city is not equal to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not been completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in Northern London. Yet, Ye Old Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it does not count.
On the other hand, the carousel of Central Park is still a strangely magical experience ‚Äî even to the extent that two two two - year - olds, one eleven - year - olds and two women in their 40 ' s enjoy it tremendously.
I would have given the carousel a perfect score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to assess my "payment experience" on a scale from one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reading device.
It's the same thing in a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine 15 percent service money with the estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer servant to put his personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The clerk at the department store smiled at me when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter, "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuqi of the team's coaching duties.
Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously worked as assistant coach, assumes responsibility for coaching.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current assignments.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously been an assistant coach in Sunderland, England, among other things.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta who joined Inter's coaching team has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H√•kans, Chairman of FC Inter's Board of Directors, regrets what has happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, so that there was no alternative at the moment, H√•kans commented in the Society's press release.
The Piccareta Agreement shall remain in force until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to the Evening Words, the team's been frantic on Thursdays.
On Thursday morning Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong stand in Inter's match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, the violin artist, published a youth picture on Instagram.
Several has been added to the picture, which leads to the conclusion that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself marvels at the young woman who looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's texting.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it right here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just a year ago, he published a couple of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he's seen 20 years ago, in the second he's posing now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
20 years ago, 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags of life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating troubles of previous years.
She was already 14 years old in the hospital because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was not finally discovered until 2006.
The healing began gradually.
In addition to therapy and peering, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from prison to the hospital for chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors complained of the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp during the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several shots through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the bathroom.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius' six - year sentence to be too mild.
The Prosecutor-General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians illegally camped were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unlicensed campers in Sitonia on the morning of August 1, among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the case continues.
According to TV channel bTV, the State Department later announced the release of Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on all those who camp outside the designated areas.
Inspections shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry has informed us that the court may impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinks - already sunk -7.7%

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help to ease the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that essential amino acid tryptophan in protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the research director, immune cells guard from the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that balance the inflammatory cells, which strengthen tolerance, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the infection, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
In the tests, immune cells that strengthen tolerance were found in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to cause immune cells to appear. Tryptophan is one of the ingredients of proteins.
"We detected a connection between the development of the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
"The more tryptophan there was in the mouse diet, the more such immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
When studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, investigators, Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbials in the intestines of mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When DNA from the intestines of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
After administration of the bacteria Lactobacillus reuterine to raised mice in a sterile environment without microbial bowels and without immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system; they were growing the bacteria called "Lactobacillus reuterine" in the liquid and transferring small amounts of fluid ‚Äì without bacteria ‚Äì to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into cells that strengthen tolerance.
When the active ingredient was removed from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice' diet, the number of cells to strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased to half the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance cells as the mouse, and most of us have the bacteria Lactobacillus reuterine in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri are causing cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with ICS.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"A high level of tryptophan combined with the bacterium Lactobacilus reuter may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thought Manchester United got a "nero" in his ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The middle field player debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea with ¬£40 million, started with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, United's last round of the game before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was impressed by his defensive middle field player against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not yet in the best condition because he was not on the Asian tour of blue shirts before the season started. He managed only 45 minutes in the field ‚Äì according to Mourinho, the change will have to come before the season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius ‚Äì he has the natural thinking ability of football," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to file for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four preferred players.
"Three out of four ‚Äì we have to thank the company for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women harassed Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball national team lost their fourth round of the World Championship to Germany directly in 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of gambling is high.
Their game was flat in every sector, according to Tapio Kangasniemi, Finland's main coach.
In the first two rounds Finland kept its opponent in a tight position, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany's leading the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we could swing along," Kangasniemi said.
The most efficient in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Three out of four losing Finland will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The Grand Jury has already sent challenges regarding Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent out a series of lawsuits in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for his Kremlin contacts.
Reuters, a news agency, confirms the announcement earlier on Thursday by the Wall Street Journal that a grand jury is being convened.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges regarding the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which was held during the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, currently at the White House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russian investigation will be intensified.
Sources add that Mueller wanted to assist the grand jury in an investigation into Russia's involvement in the presidential elections in the United States and whether Trump's campaign or his associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury will extend Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges and force people to testify on oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence investigated by the prosecution and decide whether or not to press charges.
A British inventor chipped himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand.
The British inventor has been the first in the whole country to chip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to meet medical requirements for the installation of a microchip.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's company also turns the locks on the houses and cars into a microchip, and it costs ¬£300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The white house exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
Last month's White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern lawn for an American production event cost taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was a attraction at an event in the White House on 17 July 2017 where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter built in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be present only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn at the "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because it is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the day before the HMX-1 incident, the commander wrote an e-mail to his supervisor, who is an assistant commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17 July at seven o'clock in the morning and the event would start at three o'clock in the afternoon.
In addition, the message mentioned that if the helicopter were to be delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be required to be deployed due to service time limitations.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the Time magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 asked if the incident was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told that there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can attend," the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the reform of the health care sector that was being discussed at the time, as well as in favour of looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them on their travels.
but using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the presidential campaign event back in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the event Made in America, which introduced products made from American materials from all 50 states by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with an accuracy of one centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
Unit helicopters were also flying 11 hours on that day in "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, the event did not cost taxpayers any other expense.
Sikorsky's spokesman reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern grass court of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly allowances, the VH-3D helicopter's compensation level is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to the HMX-1 files, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"It is misleading to calculate the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation," Walters says.
‚ÄòThe estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations'.
According to a 2015 study carried out by the RAND Research Company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former press secretary of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is entirely appropriate to point this out."
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down at the scene of the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit the Vaasa track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Sein√§joki and Vaasa has been broken due to a technical failure, says Railway Traffic Centre.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The failure of the traffic control system was caused by thunderstorm.
The railway transport centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative body in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court ruling to prevent the appointment of a new representative body in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the elected representative body of last Sunday's vote is due to be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a representative body was elected to the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the refusal decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation by voting.
He appointed two judges for this post after the British company, which held the election, told us that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated, and the elected 545 members include Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, representatives can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the reshaping of the Constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new representative body.
Maduro claims that the new Parliament is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
There have been numerous injuries and more than a hundred deaths.
Venezuela sank into an economic crisis after the price of oil dropped.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday when the new representative body is to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court of Justice in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a worldwide computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, reports AFP.
In March of this year he was found guilty of computer fraud that had gained the benefits of millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence has been served.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs harshly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for user names and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the information by continuing to control Internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to the Acting Director of the Justice Department, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt down cyber criminals operating in others.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in the press release.
Modified at 8:58 a.m.: Corrected for flattening the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third-generation trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali cartel takes the lead in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered in Narcos' second production season, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth production periods are seen in the series. The third-period trailer has been released and presents the new villains in the series.
During the third production period, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world.
The organisation led by four godfathers is "like Fortune 500", except that there is a little more corruption and violence among the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe√±ana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third period of Narcos production begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuun photo artist Kari Kola (in Kuavssa) will perform an exceptional work of light art in honour of the UN's first Light Day in Paris next May 16th.
Kola is doing a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument on its doorstep are illustrated in the work.
By my work I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make things that I feel are important concretely visible," says light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am very impressed with the invitation to be involved in the first international Light Day and bring the light art into the theme day," Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illustrated UNESCO's headquarters to celebrate the celebration.
I feel very privileged to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters," says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand considerably.
We will inform you about this later in the coming autumn," Kola continues.
The objective of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men were fighting in a mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into a fight in Espoo at a shopping center in the Big Apple parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was an oral argument between the drivers.
The driver who drove in the forbidden direction swung at the driver of the other car, and as a result, the car started moving, hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the hood of the car that was still hit.
In the preliminary address, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and that he has done wrong.
The article entitled by Timo Soin: "After that came the flood"
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog article titled by a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs in government.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The Soin text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the parable of the Flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the records of history have left the phrases "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote on them, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Mr Haysom, interim director of the UN Mission on Aid, said that hundreds of women were nominated for the elections of the provincial councils, three women were running for Vice President and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Regional Council and Presidential election will take place on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Mr Haysom said that women's contribution would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the big crowds are storming through the sights.
Venice is smothered by tourists making quick day trips to the city.
On narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the residents of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while hotels have replaced their homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a low-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you give two or three hours.
You follow the flag guide from the Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and turn back," Dario Franceschini, Italian Minister of Culture, describes the tourism that is prevailing and causing problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must retain this part of the identity of cities.
Saint Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit the historic centre of Venice.
The church of St. Mark is located on the edge of the square.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50 000 locals living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were about 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
This is a difficult equation, because ships bring to Venice the income it so badly needs and create a need for many different jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historic centre.
In the view of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative district, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own business - if not full autonomy.
Every year, about 20-30 million tourists visit Venice.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Traffic jams on the motorway for miles
On the motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinj√§rvi, the north lane has had traffic congestion during the return traffic during Thursday afternoon's work.
The area has motorway coating work, which slows traffic down," says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km/h speed limit for road work instead of the normal 120 km/h speed.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had actually progressed in some places during Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon road work progressed on the side of Lake Siil by the statue of Revelation, or golden goat.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful pictures of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in her current home country, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre race by going around the track on 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 - meter fence race at the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, who was diligent in social media, found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
The men around the world began sending pictures of their sex organs to Iuel, evidently in the hope of being interested in them by a young runner.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "stupid pictures" from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account into a private account, Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel didn't want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he was getting.
I guess you can guess, Luel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'm fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, his family moved to Namibia first because of his father's work, then Pakistan.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally," Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records for 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
The leg injury put the snowboarder Janne Korve at risk for his entire career - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
Now it's been nice to count when nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31 of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has really enjoyed his beloved sport this season.
Last summer's career was still at stake.
The stress on the foot table had forced the Korve to the operating table in January, and there was no desire for the leg to heal.
The hand had hit the race slope too.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether or not the rafting was going on.
The sponsor deals were cut off and a lot of things were open," Korpi says.
But that's what they say. That's the way things work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that no later than the first time I went to the snow.
I was like, "Damn it, it's so much fun." Let's do it a couple more times.
Raven didn't get to count properly until September and October, but after a long bill break, it's been a big deal just working out painless.
Kisoja Korpi has only passed a few.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the ferrying to Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim four years at a race, and then you're gonna be feverish for that week.
I can't think like that, Raven says.
Today, Raven competes in the halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races don't hold him on boarding, he always lights up when he's in tough company.
According to Korve, the international skiing association has increased its appreciation in recent years, even though some of the boarders chose Norway's X-Games at the same time.
Yes, this is an important race. It's a big sight.
But I always think appreciation depends on the circumstances and the level of the games.
In Sierra Nevada, Raven is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team.
The team's coops, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I myself was at that point that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It'll give you a new power, too, Raven's thinking.
There's still some way I can keep up, but otherwise, no, that's what the guys got!
In the background of the ferry career Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to racing sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, there's no time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at least the results and usually some departures," Korpi says.
According to Korva, ravishing and coaching are a potential career plan when the surfing career comes to an end.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's probably an option.
I feel it's like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and develop, maybe in the summer there'll be some departures.
If that's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The ravi stories also include Elitloppet ravirointi with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet restaurant.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, let's hope to fill the ship," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project to Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esther is the name of a new 41-seat care home for the elderly.
A well over 1,700 - floor square meter building is expected to be completed next summer across the health centre's neighbor's Health Road.
In crystal, the common cause of wonder is the number of customers in the new care unit, as now many private care homes suffer from a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that in the future, Kite will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better," Flink says.
Last year Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The transaction involved business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move functions away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scotland factory
The trade union seeks confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer for a long-term commitment to production at Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the GMB of the British General Trade Union, the company has not mentioned its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products factory has over 500 employees.
The company Pladis, which owns the McVitie's brand, reported that it invested more than ¬£5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would be "be sure to be the first to be informed" if there were any changes to their operations.
In its letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to ‚Äòreply the concern that no funding has been allocated to modernise production lines'.
Drew Duffy of the GMB Trade Union is extremely concerned that the factory manager does not provide clear information on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has concentrated heavily on the local community and Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods and Brexit, rising cost of living and the constant reduction in production, the Eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production sorely."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had received a letter from the trade union only the day before and the company responds directly because it appreciates the constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our business operations and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the information provider, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and improving its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying ¬£ 189 million to close the contract, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about event of the summer. The French League 1 football team is ready to break the world record of settlements. The previous record was less than half as low as it was when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a ¬£89 million transfer amount.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as the PSG offers him more than ¬£500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona is known to be enraged by the PSG's activities and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the company. A source near Barcelona tells us that Neymar has been very well cared for since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponent and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are after our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have done just that: it expressed its interest in the PSG's middle field player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player, Neymar.

The phone calls Trump made were made up by a White House publicist, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed calls with both the president of Mexico and the head of the scout organization have proved to be made up.
The White House publicist Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty big accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face to face, Sanders explained.
Talk to Boy Scouts Disappointed
On Monday, Trump told me that the President of Mexico called him and praised Trump's success in eliminating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few will cross the southern border of Mexico anyhow because they know that the journey will stop at the border with the United States.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a press release stating that there was no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released the perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it Trump gave his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scout organization announced that it was not aware of a call made by any of its leaders to Trump.
According to the press release, Michael Surbaugh, the director of the organization's earlier statement, in which he had apologized to the scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for himself.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts' Conference was a great surprise, as it was exceptionally political in nature.
Among other things, he praised the results of the presidential elections last autumn.
