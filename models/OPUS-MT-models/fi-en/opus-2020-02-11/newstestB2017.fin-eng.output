A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a San Francisco mall.
Only recently a 28-year-old cook who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at Westfield Shopping Center Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reports from the San Francisco Bureau of Law Medicine.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told the CBC radio station in San Francisco that Frank, a former cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters Restaurant six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family. We're very sorry," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank first lived in the hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment and had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and with a great heart.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the stream.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows about the case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-4444.
Striked Junior Doctors Require New Industrial Action
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are mainly responsible for specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in the dispute over a new contract of employment.
The JDC, a member of the British Trade Union for Doctors (BMA), is requesting support from the whole government for further labour-fighting measures from early September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published a letter on Twitter to JDC members, saying that the government 's stubbornly silenced' on the issues which, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted against a whole new draft treaty and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government requesting permission for progressively expanding industrial action since early September."
In the light of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawia, director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
Ms Malawia said to the members of the BMA at the meetings before the vote that the agreement was a good one and that it should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
Following the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and bring to an official conclusion the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin received his Turkish brother in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even on his own abstinence standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin â€“ according to one report, five times.
I couldn't keep track of myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I myself understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian client has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Mr Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was fierce.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain real trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas controlled by ISIS in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it is time to move on.
At the end of the day, this meeting took place only so that Mr Putin received his request for forgiveness from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost replaced last month in a failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as many millions of Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be sighing about relief when air traffic can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables when Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in Vedemost magazine.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes that the West is subduingly reacting to the attempted coup.
Not to mention the old resentment about Turkey's EU accession negotiations and Putin's interference, which is eager to take advantage of the cool spaces and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able, by their summit meeting at the Prady Sea Palace, to convey the image described by an analyst as 'an alliance of outsiders': two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of differences between countries, while Mr Putin emphasised them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a total disaster caused by Turkey, a member of NATO, when shooting down a Russian fighting machine, it is no doubt better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are once again on speaking terms.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland
According to the President of the RBS Bank, the Bank's activities outside Scotland will be reduced in such a way that it will continue to provide only back-office business services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank's global objectives.
The bank had to back off when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that period brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to enter the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be used as an abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeeste, with the exception of the head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because our staff is working for because we are now becoming a much more bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the time to turn into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's President.
"It would have been very insulting three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put the brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on customers' needs rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win in Newmarket and won his 3,000th victory
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3 000th victory in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race running on a smooth track.
In the past, Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have reached the same level.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family's here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly normal Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humility."
Dettori takes cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the day, and it's no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical ability is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race, his enthusiasm and his cutbacks have been bringing supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for a British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori vented his accomplishments in a symbolic way by flying off his horse.
"From flying goals to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model of British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won a number of big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the plane crash and has been banned from competition as a result of misuse of medicines.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had a starter difficulty, but he showed admirable strength of character, seemed to his skeptics and returned to his best.
And for a while now he's not ending his career â€“ Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years old."
Putin fired Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's confidant inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the information provided by the Kremlin, President Putin â€˜decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian Presidential Administration', but no justification was given for his dismissal.
Anton Vaino was appointed Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
The persecution, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO), and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he ran the President's Protocol Department and the Government Office, reports the Kremlin's Russian website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you have given will be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian television, they both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles on the cameras, few are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are the firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that the man who has been praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Mr Ivanov took office in December 2011.
In the meantime, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin was Head of the Security Service of the Federation that replaced the KGB (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Head of the KGB.
As Putin entered power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second period, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's immediate circle, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson was fired after beating a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, reported the kicks in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series Gibson had made an apology on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reports ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a release published on Friday.
"I hoped I'd see the show through to the end, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th production season of the series begins in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious beaching of fish in Banffian garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windfish that have been caught in the land as a landscape of a hurricane.
Bain, 500 meters from the seashore, released footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five - inch [5 cm] fish.
The Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife.
The Â£1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected the north deck and the land bridge of Queensferry's overpass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "folders" which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The Â£1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the cabinet minister responsible for the economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with over 30 000 concrete and steel being used to build this bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to receive its concrete cover in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak of the road and water construction sector.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower road deck, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side (i.e. on the ground).
This was done by pulling the north side of the land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive operation, and at the same time it required great precision.
Massive due to the length of the bridge of 222 metres and the weight of approximately 6 000 tonnes, it had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3 per cent.
And it requires great precision because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small â€” only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports a miracle rescue of three men.
Three men on board their fishing boat outside Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
The Marine Rescue Station of Moelfre RNLI issued an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew spotted an accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat going right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately transported the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted in the buoy and without a life vest.
They were all picked up on a coast rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who have fallen on water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The engine of the boat had an emergency extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had been detached from the man who was driving the boat at the time of the crash.
They really had luck on their way."
PokÃ©mon Go Hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
PokÃ©mon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, it took only watching TV to get the screen time, then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude one another.
This is, of course, my reference to PokÃ©mon Go. PokÃ©mon Go is a game application, the characters of which come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a cartoon series, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this stopped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of PokÃ©mon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for PokÃ©mons with their smartphones, which are monitored using GPS. When PokÃ©mon is found, it can be "photos" (with the phone's screen image) or "capture".
The wildness has taken a generation who played video games when they were younger and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch's Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing PokÃ©mon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have echoed deaf ears because they have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of PokÃ©mon Go is that it makes people out do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health - support factors â€” exercise, fresh air, and the sun and joy.
You can even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, those of this phenomenon are displeasing to ridiculers.
And yes, someone can walk to the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is complete.
Because while smart phone applications such as Fitbit could already monitor your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to start, as PokÃ©mon Go does.
The new attraction disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, with PokÃ©mon's success, there will be more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and health of people who go hunting.

Simone Biles grabbed gold in a women's gymnasium multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
It's easy on the boom.
The jaws fall on the permanto.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old gymnast won a multi-match championship on Thursday and grew the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of Aly Raisman and Aly Mustafina, a silver-based teammate.
The US Simone Biles performs on the boom at the multi-match final of the women's gymnasium competition on Thursday at the Rio de Janeiro, the summer Olympic Games in 2016 in Brazil.
The party became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time who won the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his total final score became visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species into completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class as other sports superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to his sport for the past three years. He has won 15 World Championships, 10 gold of which, with so ambitious and precise programmes, earned them so much that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one last competition, which was mainly between Balaam and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Balaam and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
The US Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman hug gold and silver after winning the women's gymnasium competition at the multi-match final on Thursday at Rio's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as if it were a point for Martha Karolyi's farewell party, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program â€“ which includes a series of volts known as his card card â€“ is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Even when his grandparents were young and found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure. Boorman found a girl while she was on a daycare tour in the gymnasium where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina was able to take the lead with two threads, it was like mirage.
There was a boom and a permanto where Biles is the defensive champion of the world.
He regained leadership with 15.433 points in the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points in perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they waited for the final points â€” a mere formality â€” and tears began to appear around the red, white, and blue eyebrow color at the time of his dream written in his scrapbook.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch to a four-year-old competition when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-run.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the "mamma" of the team was clearly ahead of the Mustafina.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from a loss position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Balaam is concerned, this 19-year-old's earlier week's wide-spread tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
The police report that three of them were heard in the car as victims of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre for ten years, while the victims were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports a police bulletin published Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, says the release.
The police suspect that the triple homicide was not a robbery because the attacker did not steal the purses and the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says that the police are now investigating whether the murder is related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks that have taken place mainly in Latin - American settlements within four months.
"It is common for events to occur in residential areas outside the homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
Suspects are believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the three had often sat in a car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a press release stating that an empty pickup truck was fired only half an hour before the triple murder, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a six-year-old boy with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
However, unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or innate small - headedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, of which he was not aware when pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was not to get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all â€“ of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking through a walker.
Edmund got up and started to crawl when he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is going to introduce Edmund's idea of a sign that means "sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language; it also includes the signs that Edmund himself invented.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary infections such as Edmund's, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
There's a lot of variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how this affects the lives of those affected by Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "What's going to happen to us,
What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope - inspiring advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread floods.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississip flooded their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the National Safety and Emergency Response Office, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipaho County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the information provided by the Weather Service, further 76â€“127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River, Baton Rouge and the Amite River, near Denham Springs, both of which are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that the floods downstream in Ascension County constitute a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, right south of the state border of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 p.m.
Rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in Southwest Missipi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson, were previously near Glolor on Friday among the rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water came on a constant pitch," Hansford says.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she lived in the area.
Hansford reports that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had rescued all three of them into a large army - style truck and took them to the fire station in Glolor, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was heavily wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
The authorities report that because of heavy rains and flooding streets, people in Tangipaho County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangipaho had told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
Robby Miller, district director, reports that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
There are shelters for the evacuations in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to recede," he says.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipaho County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed because of the flood, and the residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"For the last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Council.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, rescue director at Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported under the flood, but on Friday no news had been received so far.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store, says that he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets in his body, survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old who has been shot this week in the city.
The child's grandparents told me that the boy was Mahaj Brown on CBS Philadelphia.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the television company they think he's gonna make it.
He was starting his first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men were also shot and one 32-year-old male.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shell casings from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," reported Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department to the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and according to reports, the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old in town this week was a girl with a stray bullet in her hand while playing outside her home on Tuesday in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic women's gymnasium team, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose to be the surprise winner of the games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three times the world champion Simone Party, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and mastered gymnasium programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a multi-match of women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The view is like this at the top of the species, but it does not look the same in gymnasium classes all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five") because the next stage gymnast in the Olympic team will only have four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnasts are an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnasts, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, travels, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The facilities of most gymnasium clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of teline gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and that means an expensive and long - term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Party coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained sports enthusiasts since they started gymnasizing.
We need to provide a more affordable and accessible gymnasium education for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnasium 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have provided a free or affordable opportunity for gymnasts for more than 15 000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin Americans) and some of these young people have achieved national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown Detroit so that we can offer high-quality gymnasium to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Teline gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnasts, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into being prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes in remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister Hunt announced plans to force agreement and said that the British public health system (NHS) is "no one's country" and that any further delay is harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will enter into a new agreement which will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Junior Medicine, made a statement last night, saying: "Junior doctors continue to be very cautious about the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new treaty, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
I did, even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The last strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13 000 routine procedures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strike doctors.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the staff of the British medical union.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to take further strikes.
Mortimer says: "Work battle activities achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at extreme borders and cause concern, distress and disturbance to patients, nursing staff and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the junior doctor's committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
Workers were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector was a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to maintain agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine that pays about â‚¬2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about â‚¬2.40 a day to receive a medicine that pays when recommended by the authorities to give it to more people and for longer periods of use.
Anti-coagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of the UK public health system (NHS) has advised patients that ticagrelor should be administered for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) of the UK public health system (NHS) has advised patients that ticagrelor should be administered for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people have a heart attack every year, one quarter of whom have a relapse or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty matter that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is released, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is greater in people who have had a heart attack.
The ticagrelor manufactured by AstraZeneca in Britain, which is sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of stoppers.
Today's draft NICE guideline recommends that ticagrelor be administered for next 12 months and then reduced to 60 mg twice daily and given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, who evaluates the introduction of treatment methods, says: "Although effective treatments are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms effectively, as many as a quarter of those who have had a heart attack have a new seizure or stroke â€“ often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in relation to the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend that the treatment method be used for a longer period.
Because of the climate of political correctness, electoral fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to electoral fraud 'because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
According to Pickles, known as the former Minister of State for Regional Development and the current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had the right to set up guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be dipped in unexploited ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He called for better access for journalists to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working parties.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The Court held that Rahman 'sstood' the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said "to base his campaign on the fact that every believing Muslim had a religious duty to vote for him".
Of the votes, up to 300 had been called into question or given fraudulently in a way that a person voted by pretending to be another person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the fraud in the postal elections, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressing people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots from political activists, in order to prevent 'voice harvesting'.
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks at the time of registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for migration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Baptism of fingers into indelibly ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting the handling of filled-in mail sounds and letter envelopes from political activists.
For the police, the right to set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person at a time can enter the voting booth.
Sir Eric harshly criticises the London police and finds it "awesome" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his duties for corruption and numerous unlawful practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient 'checking' of the city council's electoral lists.
"The decision of the Court of Justice last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by worrying and covert electoral fraud by some people and its denial."
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance with Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers go wild at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games went wild this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance with the duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.

In addition to the duchess Catherine's doppelganger on the bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be the double brother of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
The US men's archery team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after pictures of him, where he strikingly resembled the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance that big, except for the beard and the mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were excited about the resemblance, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these Games.
Great and expressive Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called Gloria Estefan's doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.

These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and the actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) of the Dexter series, resemble each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance.
This user wonders whether a couple's resemblance is a good reason.
A tweeter recently expressed his satisfaction when "others on the Internet also agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The football star of the United States and the actor in the Dexter series are strikingly reminiscent of each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found the resemblance between Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's smiles and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna! starring Gabrielle Union smiles.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth women's 4 x 200-metre free swim message shocked the CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he began to express his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter free swim final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team, was heard to say: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, which allowed Canadians to catch China.
The viewers from all over Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who was swimming in the final of the women's 4 x 200 meter free swim message, was described as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with fierce comments from Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how oblivious Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Scott Russel, who hosted CBC's broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC finally had to apologise more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to the comments of more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they made the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify what he said by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for my comment last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I did not mean anything degrading by what I said, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, uninhibited undergarments in the middle of the store, the woman who tried on the shop shocked customers.
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman took her clothes off in the middle of Primark to try on her underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally tried four pairs of underpants at the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place, where she tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the same time at the store, reports that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
A woman stood in the middle of a store, took her underpants off the shelf, stripped her own tights and underpants, and put them on.
Instead of trying to do it inconspicuously, he did it with complete shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took the underwear he was trying to get off his feet, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn't like any of them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks â€” nor did he think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and has not been washed."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the shop staff tried to remove these items from the sale after the woman had left â€“ which is right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without having washed them afterwards," adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesman commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products concerned have been removed from the market.'
That's how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Union in New York, and asked for advice on how to cope with a gun - waving robber or abuser.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the firing line," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun so that it gets between your elbows and your upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groin, and when he goes out of pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of a gun and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video. See how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash â€“ unless you are the great master of Krav Maga.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his resistance and cacomis reflexes to the hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking euro banknotes, handrails on Piccadilly Circus, train flush button and Russian public telephone.
Before licking Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made a documentary film Ian Wright â€“ On the trail of internal force, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet button on the train may be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals for the confirmation of good bacteria in the intestines and for their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused nothing but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt licking the handrails at the railway stations and the flush button on the toilet challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: "I've been rather careless about my health since I was a child and put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really proved himself worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a dirty public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border was met in a Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when a luminometer measured 4,000 units â€” in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures with Valio in a documentary Ian Wright â€“ On the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
This place is so disgusting, I'm definitely not licking anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright â€“ Towards internal power in cooperation with Valio.
In the Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria and C- and D-vitamins, which helps to strengthen good bacterial strains and resistance in the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Category Manager for Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came to the idea of asking Ia to come with us."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a wider context instead of just talking about products and to tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian bathroom, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular and 58% reported using products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Before his eviction, the disturbance family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The disorderly family left behind 50 000 pounds of damage to a rented house owned by the city after they had been evicted by terror in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Cornwall Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the dwelling, the representatives of the rental housing company said that the apartment was in a state of renovation.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on the floors and walls had been stained with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says that she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this kind of thing.
There is much to weigh, as the property is likely to become known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's reign of terror involved street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and transmission, and loud shouting, fighting and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an anti-social order.
There were several rooms in the house under the threat of demolition where old waste was found.
In the past, drugs had been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said that the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Department evicted the couple by force this week after giving them 11 more weeks to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors were grateful for eviction â€” they said that their lives were in hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called in.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown from the crazed wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own behaviour, as eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, for the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at in the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their 20 ' s.
A dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after eviction
Housing workers must now clean out the heaps of garbage around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found over 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other items and Â£1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they're demanding eviction for tenants who violate the lease rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say that this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they please without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beached army jet frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed into an amazingly low altitude.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicking when a low - plane jet crashed over the beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane comes near contact with tourists sun-sunning on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose to their feet with understandable concern about the roar of jet engines that began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the people who photographed the dramatic pass and the videos of the vacationers published in social media were Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggering low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the plane had to be flown so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused damage in parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exiting the result of the first half of the year better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) produced EUR 3.4 million better than planned.
Exit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
Exote is trying to reduce the number of queues this year.
The ex post balance covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Exote's Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special frontier soldiers took a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath ceremony of the Rangers and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special frontier soldier course's oath was held in the military field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border soldiers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special frontier medicine.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special frontier soldiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the wartime border forces attended a veteran meeting in connection with the jury.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operated by the RTA unit, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible outwards.
The HÃ¤me Police Department comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and HÃ¤meenlinna.
It's being run by an officer stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit's strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in HÃ¤meenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity," says Deputy Chief of Police Tero SeppÃ¤nen.
The RTA unit provides different investigations to the rest of the police.
In HÃ¤me it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working practices
The creation of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, the police would never leave until they were alerted.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were set up in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit was set up for each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in conjunction with the Central Crime Police, is operating nationally.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are responsible for providing information to local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
As far as the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive crime or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's honest or criminal.
Based on the method used, the unsub becomes a certain image.
It can be done either on the basis of the method of doing it or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
Neither the methods used by criminals nor those used by criminals are reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police attempts to combat crime.
The police will publicly report these methods if they anticipate a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, a method of marking vacant dwellings used in house break-ins.
It was the people who put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment that they tried to see if the residents were really out of town.
The pre-trial material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The unit of analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The cleverer order the District Court minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we're going to steal gloves.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero SeppÃ¤ of the HÃ¤me Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami JoutjÃ¤rvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuumela of the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined Daddy was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee reports that the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Syria, Rambqa, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike against Ramba, an ISIS base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and her family said she was just planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going to a war zone - and that will cause people to give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana joined two other East London schoolgirls on a plane to Turkey and took a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
The Senate's Democratic Director, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court judge if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have not agreed to confirm Garland's name since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will choose the person to fill the post of Supreme Court Judge Anton Scalia.
Mr Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he was predicting Clinton's choice of Garland "unquestionably".
Reid's spokesman later pointed out that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton as to whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "draw the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Reid says that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the presidential candidate Donald Trump's "Callbacks" and "Developers".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars belong as well to women as men.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemerme and introduces a 1970s-style calendar inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of public nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of treats, told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine differs from the old school Playboys, as he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, just as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that praise the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who wish to serve as a model for the calendar can send their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write in the comment section with the title of your angry objection NotAll LonelyMen, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov's research company, the new appearance of much-spoken vinyl discs is not behind a Millennial-generation boom when the Millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the background is mid-life nostalgia.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just a matter of interest to enthusiasts, it is a matter of emotional importance: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But is the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me walking along the lively Soho Street, wearing a gray suit of jewelry. I'd make a lively gesture, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rarity when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperbase have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and character.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by two young women, three middle-aged men, from Sister Ray (at that time) to Reccless Records (at that time eight middle-aged men, probably 20), are on a conference trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time by getting acquainted with the supply of shops.
I'll see if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 albums."
These plates fill his living room wall as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income; he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared and buy again things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get it," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people who have been affected by media hypnotism, who have heard about the re-entry of vinyl discs and now feel compelled to buy their old albums back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl-squeezes of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds you realize in a movement like Phonica that they offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset about the non-contact payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world, for returning to familiar disc cases means permanence and a reminder of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires material property for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I experience it myself as a collector, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" says Wez's co-worker behind a pile of records.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41 percent have a record player that they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers have no record player at all.
At this point in time, I would probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bosa nova collections.
The new coming of vinyl plates is also accompanied by a "pocalyptic phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, who sells the Sounds of the Universe movement (three middle-aged men at that time).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they still do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fop, where I come next. The store has devoted a whole layer to vinyl plates.
There are 70-year-old couples, photographers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is delightful, even though the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz rocking the speakers, Wild Beasts' latest sex-stricken synthesizer pop.
None of the customers look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He's looking rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the finest beauty of the wine is...", he lets go of the delightful sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired the new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping around in jeans shorts, but who, instead, gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase filled with Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac albums: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key albums for any average collection.
No one's looking at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior element and part so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure art vinyl.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group, which is most likely to have more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxuries such as vinyl discs.
Although my research suggests that youGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans who actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work.
I'm sure they won't be spending their Thursday mornings groping around the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old TV runner who stares scaryly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker or ice shark is the longest living vertebrate â€“ video report
According to researchers, the longest living vertebrate on earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 512 years, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of the shops in the jungle camp.
The French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In the trial this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break down the 72 temporary shops established in the refugee camp. Stores sell different kinds of goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. In temporary restaurants you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais' Prefects, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are subject to fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals offered by a government-supported organisation and other parties are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect to be â€˜fully understandable'.
According to Judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla, the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than simply providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places at risk of unloading was the Jungle Book Kids CafÃ©, which is non-profit-making and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition requiring children's cafÃ©s to be kept.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrands, estimated on Friday that after the sharp increase in the number of arrivals during the summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record figure of over 9,000.
Food prices are falling significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply to the satisfaction of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
Food prices in Finland have fallen by almost 5% in three years, while the average price in the EU countries fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one per cent more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
Only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article published in the Tieto & Trends blog by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices reached a level close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn of events, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now borne by Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with wages similar to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar pay levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT should be reduced to half the average in EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at VAT rates are indicative.
School isn't quite what it used to be.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide according to which all schools in Finland operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies start already on four.
However, the main change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that the teacher was teaching the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) is known as ice sharks, but does not reach sexual maturity until 150 years old.
It can then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen has been dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow to more than five metres.
Since the rate of growth is slow, the results show that only one centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen examined.
He determined the age of 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught in fishermen's fishing gear.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbonization of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cent amazoni fins, were found to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach maturity at more than four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 sellers are not deducted.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Joint ventures in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann says in his release.
According to this, the number of sellers in the department stores will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support activities are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
When they started, the need for deduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in population is intended to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place in the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the store pay.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, trade in department stores continues to lose.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff cuts are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018", Veijalainen says in the release.
The second quarter performance improvement was especially due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex' operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the Group's operating result for the entire Stockmann Group was 4,1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure center on the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday," says HS meteorologist Ilona LÃ¡ng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but southwards are pouty.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, we'll stay at 10-15 degrees.
The Kenyan athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah was an athlete of the national team in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team team, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had taken the surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officers came by to inform the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "did his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," says Kip VÃ¤hte, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, who thundered at Reuters News Office.
Olympic athletics starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then and then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich was ranked fourth in the World Cup last year and has a number of Rio winners in advance.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid he would be exposed," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio Sports Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where the hell is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, a battle began over the medals of athletics, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a perplexingly empty audience.
The Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day's morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
Four years ago, there was another one in London, where the stadium was bulging about cheering people.
The tickets to the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The disappearance of the Rio Olympic Games has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal wishes for Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000 people in the stands were full.
The bad business is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian tourist race, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to the Brazilians used to football.
True, even Brazil's football team's first match could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, the organiser's spokesman, said this weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 at the opening.
More than half the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known species such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private, companies and entities may use money to redeem holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels that the interested parties can acquire in return for the payment of the right to wear.
The holder will have a veto in his 187-square block, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the use of the land is to be changed.
Elf rights can also be acquired for several sections.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don't have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha LeviÃ¤kangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The holder of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which allows for a visit to the block, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of holders of rights are displayed on the same map where the land block data can be found.
Leviathan sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been founded as a foundation of general interest with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would operate in some unethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be undisturbed and undisturbed.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves torment Turkey the most from the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey most of all from Finland's major cities.
This year more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police how many bicycles and parts of them have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year, calculated per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bike thefts occurred per 1,000 inhabitants.
On the other hand, in Espoo and Kouvola, police were only notified of about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities there are double the number of thefts relative to the number of inhabitants," says police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Department.
The Turku police wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how much people ride bikes in the city and how many wheels there are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Ã„kÃ¤s.
Tommi Reen of the Police Department considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to which are the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of spins available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In all Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have become known to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20 000 bike thefts a year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and approximately 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're large amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, for only a few of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bike theft, even if fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will be solved.
Typical solved bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught freshly.
"Even cases can be solved during other investigations, when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug-related apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week in connection with an act or police investigation," says Senior Officer Timo LeppÃ¤mÃ¤ki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, inner yards, warehouses and cellars, for example, where they are usually kept.
As in previous years, Jopos are the ones most stolen from individual cycles.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up on the market, for example, online.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not known that stolen bikes are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used wheel must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a good-quality bike is sold at a very low price," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa every day during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none has been stolen," says Hirvi. "No, he's never been taken, he's had a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't necessarily have hipster value," says the Helsinki-based Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who was in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bike with a small U-lock.
Now the bike snorted against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike on something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student in Helsinki about his white bicycle, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that bikes have been taken away."
"For the most part, bad bikes, such snot-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho."
Valvee himself was stolen a bike from the yard of the housing company a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked up, so Valve was expecting it to be taken.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer whales familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from entering a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under the age of 15 who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing from the first juvenile offense.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the perpetrator and impose a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator can join the peer jury himself to make up for his actions.
For example, there may be a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Administration, says that the model is not tight.
We have other compromise models which are used side by side.
"Every young person's actions are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by his first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflects what happened with people about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
Iikka Lovio, the service designer of Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It has been a message that you continue along the path of your choice," says Lovio.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Mr Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those who need it, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported in the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Republican Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record displeasure are threatening to bring a wave of voices to democracy in these elections," says Politico.
Only the immediate allocation of all possible funds to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-crowned anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the course of next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organisers of the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who is prominently opposed to Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not a matter of supporting anyone.
The letter lists many of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have injured millions of voters.
Moreover, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explained the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases on the part of the rich, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handhold for American workers who are suffering from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder's people, we have to go back and build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, pointing out that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the starting tax," Clinton said.
Today he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"As President, I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the financial programme announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this one".
The reduction proposed by Trump in corporate taxes has previously been called 'Trump's loophole' by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself produces in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton spiked.
These are the ratings of Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Sports competitions are usually shown in TV viewer statistics as sharp peaks.
The Rio Olympics have so far not reached a huge number of spectators.
At a time the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the squares: at the same time, 615 000 viewers from Yle's Olympic Channel TV2 followed the swimming on Tuesday night.
For comparison: the European Championships in athletics one month ago received almost 800 000 admissions at a time, while the European Championships in football received well over one million.
The most interesting of the Olympic sports has so far been Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race, which both reached the Olympic channel at a time of almost half a million spectators.
Panu Pokkinen, the general sports manager, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that for the first time the viewers will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of television viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on TV, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Games in Rio are the first sporting events to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When broadcast 24 hours a day, from 20,000 to 500 000 viewers all the time, that is a good basis.
The ratings are lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of Rio's competitions come in Finland during the night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the start, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of Finnish interest: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When the athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which in the first days of the Games became the most downloaded free app in Finland at Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the ratings for the network until later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena hasn't worked as well as any of the users.
Pokkinen says feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have provided updated versions that should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio are seen on Yle's channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
There are some species that can be monitored from Yle Fem, and on radio Yle Speech broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne, which has a depth of 95,3 metres on the RistinselkÃ¤.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving instructor, found about 20 square meters of pressure on the RisselkÃ¤, the bottom of which was shown to be 104 meters deep by the diving computer.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and PÃ¤Ã¤jÃ¤rvi go over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully charted.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of the middle depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle depth were wrong.
Adolescent of the tax advantage: Tax on pensioners is still more strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more intense than that of employees.
According to Ihalainen, the problem arose in the run-up to parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
This is not included in the Board's proposal.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the election," he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated up in Parliament by representatives of the opposition who grilled Alexander Stubb, then Minister for Finance, for election promises.
Buying power is secure, it doesn't grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance, Mr Petteri Orpo, on tax reductions is mainly about safeguarding and increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be raised.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤'s messages and Orpo's desire to respect the hard-made competitiveness pact.
He says sticking to a contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be destroyed by questioning.
It is necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in a row
The admirer appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget cycle, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in Thailand's attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy urges the Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to cancel their trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen says there's no record of the attacker yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and the referendum last week on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict surrounding the Muslim population is also smouldering," says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok," Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourist - favored Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a tourist destination popular with Finns, four bombs were detonated in the night at the holiday island Phuket, says Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where, according to the newspaper, one person was injured.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one was killed.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao resort islands.
The attacker is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta in Thailand, the attacker is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir people up to panic any more," he said to the journalists.
According to Vice-President of Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks took place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns to cancel their trip to Thailand because of explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Great Fleece for caution," Westphalen says.
Vulnerable Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place in Finland during the night and about the victims.
We've had a little more time to get some information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The wounded include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a tourist attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half hour or so.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four-game.
The United States of America Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, still chasing stand championships at the Rio Games with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnast for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanon championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, the Party has achieved two team championships.
We've got smaller World Cup medals at the Party. They've got jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more remarkable about this, says Huovila, who has worked for some twenty years as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these past ones haven't driven out the tourists, I don't think this has.
The office of the Huvilala company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
The blanket heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock at the local time and said you shouldn't come to the office.
The Huvila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning as a result of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday," Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
On Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 o'clock local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock in the Thai time at Patong traffic had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says the Huovila who visited the scene.
Later, this car was seen in the Crown of Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave us the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear relocation
On Friday, the highest leadership change was made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin fired Chief Sergei Ivanov of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old from Estonia.
He's an ex-diplomatic. He's the number two man in Ivanov.
The fabric stream says that the reason why Ivanov was fired could be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from building up too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up a power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Dropping station in Ivanovville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape from the state media, Putin called the transformation into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer to another post and proposed that Persecution be replaced, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri PynnÃ¶nniemi of the Finnish Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin's changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90% of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected by 7:30 a.m.: Earlier we misread that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's Publicity Policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen tells STT that access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanom at the Home Secretary's events.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Government Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting file.
The Minister's Communications Director tells STT that there is a need to reform practices in the Ministry.
Usai Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time in high school.
He insulted his back thighs from the early days and had to skip Jamaica's Olympic Qualities.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included samba dancers and journalists turned into fans.
Porina Bolt emphasizes that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came from Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the first 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the confidence of his competitors despite the final celebrations of 9,69 years.
It's harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at a point of law with a clock.
The world record in Berlin at 9.58 a hundred meters and 19.19 a 200 is still valid.
In Rio Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a world record of 200 metres and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
In 100 Bolt's challenge is the Olympic winner Justin Gatlin of the 100th Olympic Games in Athens 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prize contests if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011 the $100 World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to fraud.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He's an old man in a young man's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekov is also suspected of a drug abuse.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent to his home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given me a drug sample with signs of epo-hormones.
He was ranked fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his case of doping to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xinyi given on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other suspicions of doping in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a drug abuse.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenian coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is John Anzrah, a Kenian express coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 - meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping Phelps - historical gold came in the act style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam 200 metres in a blend of his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive race.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was ranked second in confusion before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC Olympic swim commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an Iltalehti quick interview.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if social media or the British press have a little noise about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels shoes and a short dress with certainly at least enough exposure - to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no steps backwards.
It's important to look good, and small things are just funny.
I'm sure Skelton wants to scare you and maybe even startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the fuss has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay to me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone's radar's been hit by something like this.
Rio Police made two arrests for suspicion of terror.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons prior to their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
Arrested people are believed to have ties to the Isis organization.
The arrests were reportedly inciting violence in social media.
Messages to encourage violence had been disseminated in the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hangar on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and shut the place down.
The police let the crowd in after the package was blown up in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police have completed a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the beginning of the game because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only let the crowd into the hangar after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which had been a sleepy start to the games.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the race, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two races Spain reached silver.
For the third time ever during the Rio Summer Games, police carried out a controlled blasting mission.
Last time I checked, the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road biking goal last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame pushed PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren had a rough time on Thursday.
Argentinian dame kicked Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He got stuck in a car crash, and the others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been pointless.
I should have fallen into the water to be compensated," said PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren.
The Finnish man was hanging on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnishman was left in 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The accident didn't have much to do with the accident.
Friday's a big day when we're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your age.
You don't have to spend a lot of time getting a can of milk.
A number of studies have been carried out to find out the secret of the long term.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking Beer and Coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University's study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is spoken for by studies that suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life for more than six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can help to break out other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life span.
The seven-year project monitored over 54 000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
For a person to have more years in his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity will bring more years, it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute levity.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found lower cholesterol levels in women with large buttocks.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who got to the medalists at the Olympics, he's more likely to live beyond the usual bungee.
A lot of research has been trying to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring him further years of life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among people over 65 found that the person who shopped daily was likely to be less likely to be older than those who shop.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So put your credit card down - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk driver in a drunk-in-the-drunk accident went off into a truck.
On Friday night a serious truck and passenger car nose accident took place in KoskÃ¶, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place at Kosk, Koskuntien and Sorvastontie midway on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right angle of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in its lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put the fire out himself.
The passenger car went off into the ditch and from there over the ditch to its roof.
The woman who was born in 1972 who carried a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The Rescue Department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a serious DUI.
The mail sent me some loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection was defective because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to SeinÃ¤joki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in PerniÃ¶, was on Thursday buying locusts at the Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to SeinÃ¤joki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So unless there's traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The store's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services to lawnmowers last spring.
Weed cutting is on the market until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with a shock.
The media have been calling all the time, and the attention that this issue has attracted is incredible, Eltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 splits on Facebook.
Elly was able to grab her own favorites in a bag of candy, even though a few laers were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of the transport services of Posti's Enterprises, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (SinÃ¤joki) and we no longer left for part delivery (Saloon) by three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news was from the evening Sanomat.
Teija Eltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her favorites in the selection.
Loss of weight! 30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has thinned tens of kilos since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a pair of pictures on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work as early as 2009.
He has made a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday Backlund released a pair of pictures on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The backlund before and after pair has collected several praiseworthy comments from the co-suppliers.
You're gorgeous.
The same way we're going, motivation's hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the "Do It Now" project.
Your pictures give me a lot of strength and enthusiasm when you go on the same journey," says another.
In the spring Lotta dropped her last kilos on the "Let's do it now" project.
At that time he told the Iltalehti that he wanted finally to reach the normal weight, which was then 10 kilos.
In the course of three months of rehab, five kilos were finally dropped.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not by flowers and petitions but by a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The report states that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinarian Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinarian's office remembers her with words that touch her.
Joyful, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa KoskenkylÃ¤.
The woman's neighbors have said to the Evening Journal that the victim was very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and roosters.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog named BÃ¶rje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
BÃ¶rje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court passed judgment on the violation of the Equality Act on Post.
The Post had no right to suspend the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, estimates the District Court of Kanta-HÃ¤me in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Post to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Post could only have withheld part of the trainee's salary, which corresponded to the share of familiarisation in the entire day's work.
According to the District Court, the worker had been put at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's Association Decision on the prohibition of introduction.
During last November's postal strike, the PAU decided not to familiarise Post employees with temporary workers who break the strike.
The People's News first told us about it.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, written by Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (centralist) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist Federation.
Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (kesk) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalist Association asked SipilÃ¤ and Soin to express their concerns in favour of freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
SipilÃ¤ and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration... from the Estonian-speaking Persecution.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergey Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says the Kremlin.
The Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino's grandson Anton Vaino will be attending.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be transferred to special environmental and transport tasks according to the Kremlin's announcement.
According to Putin, Ivanov had himself asked for a transfer and proposed Vasio to replace him," says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
The BBC's massive acquisition of ManU's gaming ban is not seen in the opening of the Champions League.
The world record man for football transfers will not be seen in the field when England's Champion League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban on gambling followed him to England.
The huge purchase of Manchester United, Paul Pogba, is sidelined as ManU opens its league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported the BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million to Juventus, an Italian club in Pogba.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings from last season's Italian cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogban's next seam to play is the league's second round of August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starred by world-class artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festorists have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stared with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would those who did it want to go to?
It's quite unusual to think this way in the production of events.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors to last year's 70 000 by 5,000.
The festival will also see a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something must be done to finance it in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered on huge routes.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded to include 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year's venue is a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The biggest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creative things" such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable event.
Above all, we want to distinguish between content and content.
Still, fashion phenomena are also suitable for Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment," says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer in the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we see this at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in recent years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
On Thursday night, two bombs exploded at Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and blown up with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it right here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs went off in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which was favored by the Finns.
No one's known to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by forces goes to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, military troops are commanded to engage in combat tasks only after several months of swearing a military oath, reports the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, for example, of those who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the Head of Training, the first task is to appoint reserve members of the emergency teams.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for a mission that has not received the required training," says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training the armed forces in the immediate capability units starting next year.
If necessary, units may be used for military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant damages for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After the transaction, however, the house revealed a serious moisture problem that caused a microbial growth that was harmful to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in its condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and there demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the District Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the couple's costs of legal proceedings and settlements.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly because some of the need to repair the dwelling had already been known to buyers at the time of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the Court of Justice, the building defects that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition.
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation in terms of risks and inaccuracies and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left under the impression that rainwaters from the rock might have to be controlled a little over the next few years.
The transaction took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the dwelling were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, was due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the capillary humidity.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that the air contaminated by microbes could also reach the interior via the porch.
Healthy risk, mold or yeast above limit values were found in brush samples in the home care room, basement staircase, living room window-locker and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to change the dwelling against the permit prior to the transaction.
The terraces, among other things, were built, even though there were no proper permits yet.
Home problems, however, were a key issue in court.
According to the Court, the purchasers could assume from the seller that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the view of the Court of Justice, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to report on their obligation to do so, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Creepy Archive Discovery: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms of a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women were wanted as Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the National Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency was under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were conducted in women to investigate this.
The Racial Authority investigated women's backgrounds by, among other things, studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the race agency a handwritten biography and good recommendations from their loved ones.
The Racial Authority wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "savers", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides to SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the programme stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of Sire the traitor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the first race of the Finnjolls of the day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of a whole group of tails at the second race of the day.
In the overall situation, he rose to eight after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in positions 17 and three.
In the overall situation, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren is in sixth place.
In the 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left in 23th place at the opening of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19.
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤'s Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, who was the bartender of the cruise ship for the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance platforms and festivals, is still able to pork and is currently in a wild lift.
The book Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, written by Mari Kopinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to total elevation as he won the crown of the tango king in the SeinÃ¤joki Tango market in 1995.
In the race SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka KuoppamÃ¤ki had composed a tango piece for SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to plan: SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge head remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know it was sung in a hangover right away from recording a song that got a huge hit.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top-notch all the time.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, about which the book tells of, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ resigned from his partner at the time, and the case finally ended up with "You Earn Gold" in texts published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah TÃ¶rmÃ¤s were not what SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ would have wanted.
SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ had imagined himself making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but were written on the basis of the news of the 7-day newspaper.
In the newspaper's news, Jari and his ex-lover were told the reason for his excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jar said it was a total nonsense and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it... and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, even though the polls during the voting week are predicting the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flaged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The Western Policy Mantra, the theme of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, the stupid" flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its latest monthly survey responds from the professional community to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the economic loss is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many people also have the impression that a reduction in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
In particular, they were stricken by the fairness of the BBC, which gave only a couple of percent of the economists who were pro-European economists as well as the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hate press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic powerful combinations of the consequences of the separation were about.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, commercial relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters feel they have no common interests.
Although academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming profit motive of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will jam your hospital, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has immigrant children too.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real British to get a place of education if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have made the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Migrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, plans B, that is to say, the victory of a camp that favours the separation of the EU, began to be prepared more precisely in case the result was broad.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but could now be necessary.
We went out to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says about Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
Old man says the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund at that time was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately Â£20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all UK real estate funds.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trading.
When the EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm," says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, they raided the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be thrown out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cost you.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the Aberdeen continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unreasonably Pay Attention to Real Estate Funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds received an excessive amount of attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures dominate around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's blockade lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to the 2017 side.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be more "funny" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate for pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's operations in the real estate market in London
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look like much.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management in Britain, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for power.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive in spite of the morning.
The normally silent TV screens at the office were making news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive," says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finalised two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was kind of calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop
The vote was followed by a storm.
The weight collapsed, the British leadership went into change.
The market started to anticipate drastic falls in the real estate market in Britain and London in particular.
In the years to come, the London office premises were forecast to have losses of up to 20%.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the mussel has ceased, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays on the face of Vanhanen who spent his summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference will be made and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been the subject of first information.
CBRE's information on price developments covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London properties fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6.1 per cent was accumulated, says Vanhanen.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All similar falls hit crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, too, because Brexit was very quickly compared with the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man does not think that the parable is quite right, because this is a home-to-house crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a financial guarantee that's normal.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle to him - it could have been there without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started very high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly and the population in London has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that becomes globalized," says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led, for example, pension companies to seek returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used significantly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize. Decentralize.
In London, the rise in prices evened out last summer," says Vanhanen.
Even Aberdeen began to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
So, what's the next step?
It depends on how the British economy develops," says Vanhanen.
He's afraid to judge much of the future, but he says there's probably not going to be any pick-up.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady movement ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks you can work through the pits.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also decentralised," says Vanhanen.
S Group will start to register shop information in more detail than before
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, as the trading group announced today that they are starting to collect more detailed information about their customers' purchases.
To date, once data have been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will also start at the beginning of May to harass it about the products purchased.
The S Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the customer's consent and are used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
Not many customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Taloussanomit.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classes its regulars according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing data are collected only from K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer loyalty programme and there is no such programme planned for the moment.
Finland's LÃ¤hikauppa has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be connected to Valtatalos, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group," says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be reformed in the future, but LÃ¤hikauppa will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Start with the experiment.
The customer ownership and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic data include occupation, education, form of residence, birthday years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method have been stored from the S-Etusicard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terros and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted further," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Business at SOK.
The S-Group says they're informing their clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cascades, whether they want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data," says Saarikoski.
Video: Heila Puppy is Tull's newest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play with that favorite toy.
A jar of shell casings for powder gas was discovered in the box next to which Heila sat.
Powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Tulli's first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko GrÃ¶nberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
The second main reason for training a gun and explosives dog in Customs' duties is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails per year pass through the airport, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 findings related to weapons, arms parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo.
Heila will work throughout Helsinki Airport.
It's going to be looking into checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research," says GrÃ¶nberg.
Based on the performance of the heil, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
GrÃ¶nberg is optimistic about the idea.
School at Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli's dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio is also training with Heila at the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs together with other authorities decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed," says GrÃ¶nberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and Massi cash and drug dogs.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from ten puppy litters.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include racy and hunting instinct, as well as tranquillity because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go home without her, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time deal.
The evening-Sunami cameraman loses the camera microphone cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft-toy cover immediately from the "remote" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests to be carried out, next October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog wearing a work vest, says Suntio.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner's care.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active rates last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of work dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
The Mini-State got its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than a million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case once the championship was over.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team was celebrating the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in Suva, the capital, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game linked our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants there was watching the game, I heard them encouraging," said Fiji Times editor Maikele Seru Guardian.
Dramaa in Rio - a Finnish retriever fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded with his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy liftings, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of pull.
His combined result was 200 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push in his final 175 kilos, as did one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose with the ferocious roaring.
The body shivered under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The Finnish promoter's joy was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian attacker Prosa - Betting League - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a leading player on our team with power and a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good alternative," says Coach Juha Malinen of RoPS in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallin, where she scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in SeinÃ¤joki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goal king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Brave Modern Family Star again: Teenager Star Shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again blabbering by showing off his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
Shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour considerably more courageously.
The star has posed in social media pictures with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life, growing up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you look exposed, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where she will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard," says one woman in Winter Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale Mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese visitors to Northern Lights from early autumn," Visit Finland says in the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese Northern Light Tourism.
Northern lights are the advantage of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to heartwinter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter trips to Northern Lights in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts early in the autumn and goes far into the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called "mirror aurora", where the lake surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times more fabulous," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's main target group for the Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive land image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and according to Lind, Northern Lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown clearly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland," says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 when Fiji's champion team won gold.
The impressive success of the seven-player rugby race in Great Britain was devastatingly broken when Fiji won it in the finals at Rio's Deodoro Stadium on Thursday 43-7.
Fiji taught masters how to handle the ball, move, side illusions, support game, running lines and brutal force and thus won gold â€” if the country had the first Olympic medal in all its history.
Losing meant silver, which was a little bit more comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament in the Olympic Games, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard victory over the South African Boxes in 7-5 semifinals earlier in the same day could have had a negative effect on the team in the finals.
In spite of this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The British may find comfort in the fact that at least one British will get a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's training, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and presented his tackle skills to Great Britain for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team crashed into a bunch of moving buses, and world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolisau made a dive into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the organized Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it did not slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of playing the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal at the right angle, after which Great Britain was at a loss of 17-0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for the follow-up, with more than a minute left for the first half of the game.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the more powerless tackles of the British team and crashed over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British still play the role of apprentice.
Which is much the case.
The UK made large-scale changes at halftime and managed to hold off Fijians for four whole minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the excellent Fijian team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36-7 by scoring a goal for Great Britain at the left corner, but the game was long ago lost to the South Sea archipelagos, where fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made a final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring a goal at the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semifinals between 20 and 5 and Great Britain had gone past South Africa in a tight semifinal where the balance was solved by the British goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to lead at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling footwork and plunged under the goalposts at the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-player rugby team, Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
The more emotional the gold could not be in these games.
In the first draft, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 triumphant bets into history and found additional meaning for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the oars, the third voice of Coach Robin Williams echoed in the boat, encouraging them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sports, which will achieve a similar achievement.
Their superior power was undeniable, their victory was already 39rd in a row and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface of water like swans of age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the achievement of the two. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and then did not know if he would see today.
Williams said it was a tight situation back then.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
If it wasn't for surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little the way you think."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that Williams was able to start treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say so in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two thought was in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
The British Royal Artillery Regiment Captain Stanning, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we and Helen and Robin have worked together.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cashiers have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thanks to her so much, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark were approaching, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very attached in the moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We didn't seek out the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good rowing and win the race we did."
The two of us will think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the nature programs on television.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which the protesters who have been enraged by the Panama data leaks will be demanding in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of a scandal, but that was not enough for protestors.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29th.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June, in the presidential elections, criticalness towards those in power was clearly evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who had been nominated from outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
Donald Trump, president candidate for the US Republicans, withdrew his latest tumults.
He said that he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would be involved in setting up the organisation.
The Democratic Party was enraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone in command of the army fall so low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini bathing suits on bathing beaches, which are popular with Muslims, says the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that all who do not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism are prohibited from going to the beaches and swimming.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which extantly express religious ties, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi lake blue seaweed rain
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the lake ToykÃ¶s has been observed to have blue seaweed precipitation.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the levels of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci in the bathing area of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limit.
The sea of ToykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green flower, resulting in the formation of blue-green algae mass on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue seaweed precipitate turns into a blue seaweed flower, this will also be reported separately on the bathing area's information board.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes proposed by the Ministry of Finance for next year's budget.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate forest owners' age structure, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticisms in the proposal for a tax change.
Forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM's proposal starts by reducing the pure capital income of forestry to prevent it from becoming a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive tax benefits even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to understand it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he says that the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The threshold for tax deduction linked to the yield value of forests is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's too high for Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deductible circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
In forestry policy, forest gift reduction has been taking Hakkarainen decades.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm caught the motorists at Himanga... two cars derailed into a ditch... and ran into each other.
A special chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars in a row fell into a ditch, after which the person behind hit the chaser.
According to Harri PyhtÃ¤, on-call firefighter, the drifting into the ditch is suspected of being caused by intense hailing.
There were two persons in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the vehicle driving ahead was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's findings show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases cancer's malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cancer cells and surrounding tissue.
The results of the research were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications on cell biology.
Muhos's family home killing continues in court, the prosecutor also requests a murder sentence for another perpetrator.
Muhos's domestic killing continues at court for both sentenced persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to imprisonment for family home killing in Muhos.
One received eight years for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The sentence of another is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The sentenced person was also sentenced for serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and for driving a vehicle without entitlement as a young person.
The prosecution, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence appealed against the judgment of the district court.
The prosecution is demanding that a man sentenced to less severe punishment be sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit in the schoolhouse in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director from behind on the sofa in the living room.
The director had let go of the grip and led the youngster to his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned an escape from a family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest vertebrate species, increasing only at 156 years of age
The longest living vertebrate in the world is confirmed by ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years of age.
The female does not grow until she is 156 years old.
The ice shark's life span is increased by only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Investigators found out how old they were with radiocarbons.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
They allowed researchers to estimate the age of sharks.
The elder's age was estimated to be 392 years - although throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial resource - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need another world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would not be received if Donald Trump's change to corporate tax was carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with the tax cuts that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year left uncollected.
The highest rate of income tax is now 39,6, after the discount proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation of the economy and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards of haste must be renewed and energy regulation must be dismantled.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts" instead of "bureaucrats".
According to Trump, 'expensive' trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
The free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would receive a 45% and a 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need another world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift up new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's programme taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own programme early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack from the past - People's News
The sea is frantic, but the actual tide strikes in the middle of Madrid's street war - reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up Pedro AlmodÃ³var's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy, followed by Iho, where I live at the top of my Spanish career (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between the two works.
It's a casually serene love, relationship and family drama centered on a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and is seen as much of a long flashback.
Life seems to be on its way with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) will be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her grown - up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter was born, the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, comes to the second leading woman, who is a TV star from the series Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be regarded as a slob, but I would say that it is time for a one-time wipe.
The AlmodÃ³var films often have a fair distance from such characteristic blighting to the humor of Julieta.
It is a flatly played, subdued, place with good music in some places and a rather sad-minded film, which has the ingredients for elegance.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still in place and so that it gradually begins to stick more in the eye as a pure form than as a working dramatic power.
The characters in the film are affected by sickness, death or otherwise by sudden loss, but the surface remains as fine.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a name person, costumes change from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
AlmodÃ³var is very specific in these matters, but the main issue, that is, the tunes of the scene in question, is not getting any better.
Mechanically, when the impression is repeated, it is external and slightly inanimate.
AlmodÃ³var has produced the manuscript on the basis of the 2013 Nobel Prized Canadian Alice Munro's three novels.
The Novells have been published in Runaway: Stories.
AlmodÃ³var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly equidistant literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unmatched to even more dramatic drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - are dealt with in the cinema's theology.
Directory and script: Pedro AlmodÃ³var.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main performance: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to make an election effort - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the basic Finns will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided on in the spring are going to be a lot of work.
There will be no further surgery.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided will be enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (right) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of paid unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt you.
Why do ministers so much stress the fact that no new cuts are made on them?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
The Gallup report, however, that the government party expects the basic Finns to lose their lives, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared with the parliamentary elections.
The base Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, of which the price of influence in the right-wing government will be realised for a large part next spring.
The lifeline of the government of the three parties of approximately equal size depends on the ability of the Finns to stand up.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the people who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's attendance have also come to light.
First of all, new cuts are not to be seen in rhetoric, which obscures the fact that next year they are going to be carried out violently and, second, they are trying to soften the initial Finnish attack.
Major surgery in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if SipilÃ¤'s government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness in this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take â‚¬5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands at the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt will not be broken or even slowed down.
The second is to stick to the program.
It means new even harder cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what is going to happen.
These measures will not break down debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not break down debt, even though Juha SipilÃ¤ tries to stimulate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti HetemÃ¤e at the press conference prove this irrefutablely:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no leverage from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has hardly increased since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has continued on average from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more a year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by HetemÃ¤e, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will reach 70% in the middle of next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, it will cost about EUR 6 billion to maintain unemployment, which will be effectively covered by a completely new debt.
This is the understanding of the city center, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of basic Finland as to what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also carries responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to the individual municipality.
Regional planning, special care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the disabled are most clearly the responsibility of the region.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities to the State.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran from a police patrol in Joensuu at Ilomantstie on Friday night at half past midnight.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off to run away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued on the Sonakajanranta road, from which the road continued to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A blow test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
Nor did he have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch in Lake PolvijÃ¤rvi on Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door that remained above, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
It was the car owner's job to lift the vehicle.
There was hydraulic oil draining out of the fallen truck that was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the river Ilmajoki
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahti, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman, about six feet [665 cm] tall, thin, and well - rounded, with white hair under her jaw.
Observations and tips on lost movements are asked to call the hotline of the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - look at the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The fall current that knocked down the Parafest Festival tents caused massive destruction.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Association of Joensuu, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the market place at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the city theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The flow flow occurs in thunderstorms when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling flow of air.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed toward the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several rush currents in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the currents.
The rush flow hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, Friday afternoon before 5.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries to further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is aging faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than, say, a fellow who lives in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9 500 Londoners every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel on their business trips near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution by means of masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed, pushed the man standing in front of it.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital with serious injury to the further investigation.
The tractor did not run any further because it ran into the rocks in the front.
Resurrection to the coming season
The League-Riento, a member of the league of the Volleyball Championship, starts the series in October from better starting points than from memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tune is found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani SÃ¤isÃ¤ says that the new team is entrepreneurial and united.
Out of a third country, middle fighter Fred Musoni begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, a member of the Rwandan national team, is a 500-inch chipper.
Garchet is a passari, the Brazilian has a length of 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the US national team
Anne JumpmÃ¤nen has been playing at almost all the World Cup competitions in the gym band since 2003.
Now Tampere is already on the sixth race, only 2013 missed Canada's better North American tryouts.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a gym bandy national team.
I got interested, and here we are, PompÃ¤nen, 48, says.
Jumper was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, KempÃ¤nen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, no such sport was played at the SM level as the gym bandy.
They played the ball at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj hockey in the SM series, KempÃ¤nen remembers.
In the course of the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, JumpmÃ¤nen played in the women's SM series through 10 seasons, the balance of 169 matches was 51+34=85.
The latest SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu hall bandy club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Enoinen-based Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen were selected to join the Finnish national team that will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played six men's land matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defenseman of Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, has recovered from a thigh problem and is a member of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
The national team was also named Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in Finland at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the Salibandy National Team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach Volley will be decided at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals are played in series of adults and young people alike.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volley Ballers and the Finnish Volley Ball Association, the final tournament will qualify for the six best pairs of each ranking in the series.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the Pesis Stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals at home," Hasu says.
The Kouvola region set up Hasu's spark for sports and gave good food for a great hobby.
There are good memories of childhood.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old at ElimÃ¤ki's NMKY E-girls.
On top of the picture is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning around the ankles and huge aces and choreographs after the point," Hasu recalls.
In a small place, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural choice of species in the junior era to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
The beach has been playing a bit since the 1990s.
The activities of visitors have always been active.
I also went to see the Junior SM Tours myself, thinking that one day I'd be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Annina Parkkinen from the beat-up hill on the weekend at the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM gold we still lack in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmaticly.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kiskallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toe slippers will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The crash flow poured tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, the major accident was near
The rush flow poured three tents at the Parafest Festival of the Disabled in Joensuu.

There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident took place Friday at 5:00 p.m.
An on-call friend interviewed by Karelian firefighter Markus Viitaniemi tells the newspaper that there were ingredients for a major accident.
According to the paper, the outcome of the event is at stake.

Solomon's Koli courageously set out as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
The young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began acting as an extension of their home space.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking out debt and increasing the size of the order so that bread could come out of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on the farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything into the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," Solomon Koli says, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and in the fact that everything is going to turn out well.
The goal of Solomon's beef - raising Kol is to invest in even larger barns.
The work has been successful, as Solomon's Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until August 21st.

The average annual inflation rate measured by CPI over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was â€“0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 per cent.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared to December 2015 per cent) has been â€“0.2 per cent and annual inflation in July 2016 compared with July 2015 was â€“0.2 per cent.

Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are unpretentious tools that distort characteristics, creating more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it provided some of its users this week with a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth and made the cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asian people ("yeslowface").
Critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts point to a greater problem that the company has with its differences.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and it was written online by The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told us that he removed the filter.
The company explained this: the lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly denied the anime parable.
The Korean-American art student Grace Spapani, whose tweet was widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the parallel of a very tasteless Asian caricature with the effects of a filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a 'yesllowface', but one that has been taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things of this kind no longer go unnoticed, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu during an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as product manager and designer in the Medium release platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article published in the Medium and in a telephone interview, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticised the company's management, mostly white and exclusively male, and concluded his writings with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that in their one-sided staff there are no colored people who can make decisions like this, or they also have colored employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, claiming their status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but according to its spokesman, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For their part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not okay."
According to the Congressional Group of Experts, military officials distorted intelligence on ISIS
The Congressional Group of Experts published a report on Thursday that officials from the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, amended the intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what happened in the field gave rise to understanding.
The Republican presidents of the Sub-Committee on Intelligence and Defence Resources of the House of Representatives (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to report on the "public discontent" of military intelligence analysts. According to analysts, the senior military authorities embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the United States military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed and were, without exception, more positive than in the analysis of other intelligence units of the intelligence community," says the press release on the report.
"The Centcom events are unacceptable â€“ our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, California's Republican representative.
"The mistakes of Centcom's management range to the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the continuing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by Central Command in describing and analysing American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives an overview of analysts who believe that Centcom's leaders had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than what actually happened," says the report.
â€˜For example, an official of Centcom made a public statement that a large military assault on the return of Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015.'
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of ISIS.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo of Kansas Republicans in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the United States Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to undermine the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned of the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results as further investigations will continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces", says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking democrat representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "lated the publication of intelligence results, "injured the morale of analysts" and "insufficient attention to divergent views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to the 'pre-determined or political official line'.
The Daily Beast news site reported on the preliminary results of a study conducted by Congress on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the investigation of the Pentagon Chief Inspector, which was initiated following actions by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his announcement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Chief Inspector's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Sometimes experts disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to trying to determine whether the bombings conducted by the United States in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the allegations made last year cast doubt on President Obama's confidence in the Central Command and its honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of intelligence on ISIS is in line with the disagreements that arose over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study showing that President George W. Bush's government, in spite of protests from many analysts, only supported small troops in Iraq and spent only a short time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, Hooker's working group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes at the refineries controlled by ISIS had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built ad hoc refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported The Times in September.
The Centcom commander at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The United States will win the fourth duel in the women's field hockey and establish its position in the conflict settlement with Britain
Having scored three goals in a winning, six-to-one game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the American women's hockey team on Thursday when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of their goals."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and in their group share first place with Britain, who continued his winning streak on Thursday when winning Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Each team survived the final game, which determines which one of them will be the first and which one will be the second of the six teams.
First position avoids a longer encounter with the hard-core Dutch team that won the second block.
Regardless of what happens on Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised a fuss about their surprising success in these games, four years after it was left the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up the field hockey bat for the first time when he was only 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel). He got on the national team at 16 and was the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympic Games when he did not make it to the final list of players.
After this came the 2012 competitions, where he and his team hardly saw success.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've made a turn around."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account at the first half by hitting the ball near the back with a knuckle.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it proved surprisingly tough and kept 1-0 up to the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball down the left side of the field for a long time, squirming into the middle field, hitting the ball to the finish line, and thus taking the Americans to 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament where the US goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the Americans scored had sunk each one hit.
Briggs is now in his time of success.
And so did Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic hulina, a trampoline brings Zen.
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympic Games will inevitably run into you.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton that moves from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the cafeteria queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Party, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley will smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and be the best time to watch and listen, would be favored by sponsors and would perform a good mind on TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
Olympic fire does not give equal light to all competitions.
Far away from the center, partly in the shade are less known sports such as aerial gun shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast swim, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I can write a modest article about my own special favorite, I'd like to draw attention to the subdued appeal of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the Sydney Games in 2000, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Although athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never reached the medals and has not progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and the women's side of the medal prize has been held by Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
But Trampoliin has the charm of the underdog, partly because of the uncivilised ear it sounds more appropriate for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognize in this connection that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comical potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless jumping scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnasium and swimming jumps, i.e. species that are essentially combined in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolÃ­n, which means "pumpboard".
Ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged by performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics, 16 of whom are men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When reaching for gold, medallions need to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reports, namely the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical â€” and it is enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting just to watch the games.
This is where the trampoline offers a breath break.
Trampoliin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up like an astronaut, falls down and bounces back up easy.
Of course, there is also a competition, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the goal or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as an Olympic race can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will be held Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 local time and men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will begin on each day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of Olympiamania brings a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of a public huddle.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them â€“ as recently suggested by US male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal â€“ then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his gasping new fan group.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently broken up demonstrations of political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protesters have been shot to death in confrontations with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the last few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
According to witnesses, several unarmed protesters were shot and killed by police.
The videos of the demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how security forces hit young people with sticks who have been forced to stand up against the wall with their hands.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi Project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The United States military and intelligence services strongly support the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if any, will receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, even a new urban train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from a model country for democracy; human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the regime's repressive policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But things may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and there is no choice but to show their minds, it will come out," says Seyom Teshome, a lecturer at Central Ethiopia University.
"The whole youth is showing their minds.
An entire generation protested."
There are many causes for discontent, always from land use to the stranglehold of the coalition government.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result they are now ruling the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the Eritrean border, where the worsening situation in June claimed hundreds of lives.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that has been lurking under the surface for years is being released right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people get access to the Internet by means of proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oros and the Amharas.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a long time, amharas from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have dominated the country's politics and business and have exploited oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population, yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said that he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who compromised the relationship between the opposite.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles' boots with almost no knowledge.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces under the control of the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first screwed up and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from strengthening.
And a grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Amhar city Gondar protesters attacked tigre-owned companies, and antitigre hate speech is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring the neighbouring country Somalia, but the United States says that the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to draw back his words in his latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the â€˜founders' of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in an awkward situation, who must try to justify their candidate in these stormy moments and explain the comments he might not have intended.
Trump made an argument at the election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump, in a tweet, completely changed his speech from the day before when he said that he had been completely serious about his accusations in several interviews.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off.
The most recent review storm arose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as the numbers went down.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and thought Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received wide criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying: "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretchs the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees the supporters react to the messages and "clears up" in one way or another depending on the reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are sufficiently round to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more forcefully in recent days as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist reported that Trump's support is considerably lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida is on a par with the situation.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But, having been the subject of ever closer scrutiny during the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, in which they are publicly forced to defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a legitimate political speech," answered Giuliani when he was asked whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was an almost unknown, small organization, which Obama completely mistakenly called "a team of the lower series" and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama Administration, where Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to continue his efforts when it failed to take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he accused them of glaring and discriminatory attitudes toward him.
He mocked the "unusable and pathetic" TV commentators who tried to find out about him, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said it would only show more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Because of the excessive rent increase, the cafÃ© opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a shabby cafÃ© in Williamsburg, where only cash was used for payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafÃ© was priced out of its streetside seat on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals view this loss of a coffee shop that has been avoided under middle classing as sad.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB Club no longer exists, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, they're creating new ones.
Last November Verb Cafe opened a new cafÃ© in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafÃ© has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unambitious.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafÃ© is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafÃ©.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon and chicken egg-cheese sandwiches available and capers and brown onion rings available for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
There is no beer left at the cafÃ©, but juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of holding the cafÃ©, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old standard customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafÃ© on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a list item.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafÃ© before work and ordered the same thing without exception.
"I came to the cafÃ© every day at quarter past seven, like a machine, and there they already prepared my voibagelia with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but sometimes he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge about the soap store taking over the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verb's own cold-dried coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
The traditional Poles at Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafÃ© with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place for it to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee shop's cold-dried coffee.
The cafÃ© may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like coming home," says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The sad food of the Great Depression in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinaryist, was pleased with the luxurious dishes of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie grastÃ© and Maryland's turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Devil's eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The Brooklyn Heights couple both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work is the "A Square Meal" published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet the editor at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the big market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was very suitable for a discussion about eating a major depression.
"Musemies were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liverloaf and beansloaf.
They were made from substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts for a whole meal."
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, worked on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as crumbs and stews became the main food, and the casseroles were called "a wonderful way to exploit the food residues" because chefs could cover up not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the central part of the American meal for years, became sparingly used luxury.
There were strange blends where the most important thing was the calorie and nutritional values, rather than the taste or even the healthy kitchen sense.
In carrying out a study for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced baked onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage of food.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and baked onion do not fit at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office between 1923 and 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be specific budget leaders and to meet the challenge of making carrot-cream-pags tasty dishes.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are reports of government reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on a Iowa farm, he himself ate, such as the millionaire and the sophisticated master he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the meals served in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the food of the depression was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple report that they began to understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she could not throw away the food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even began to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once in a wind hat."
After the main dishes were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe brought out the plum dessert they had prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt had at his lunch.
"It's called plum mousse," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a prominent name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly plunged our spoons into thick brown blobs.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did it for the second time and for the third time.
"The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget holder.
Gilead's full remuneration for legal fees for the patent dispute with Merck on hepatitis C medicine
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it received for the patenting of the hepatitis C medicinal product against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of $200 million for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the success of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni medicines. The U.S. judge found that Merck committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action registered on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Regional Court says that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it received for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with the new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of patients with hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of the sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead's drugs.
United States-supported troops have taken the city of Manbiji from Isis
The United States-supported forces have taken possession of the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, reports the spokesman.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Group is now combing the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages abducted by the ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax.
On Friday, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced its 2015 tax return showing that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was $34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Foreign Minister, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster's publisher for his book on his term of office at the Foreign Office.
Clinton's vice president candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Caine and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The real federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20,3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a model for economic transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in her release.
In total contrast, Donald Trump hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
According to custom, US presidential candidates have always published their tax records, even though the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit and say it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income records.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this issue and published a video online on Friday to highlight prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to publish his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and the business columnist of the New York Times quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a provision named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at Clinton's election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters in the Berkshire Hathaway multi-purpose company is located in the same place, challenged Trump to meet them both to disclose their tax records.
Buffet says that he has also been audited by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid on average 32 % of the real federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40,5 %.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income to be $ 109 000.

Chili powdered firewood condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation â€” elephants are rushed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has, together with the United States Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without damaging elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation in his press release.
First, the intruding elephant is harassed by a flashlight and a horn.
If this doesn't work, throw a chilli cloud.
A mixed chili powder is placed in a condom together with a firecracker, and then the end of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left out.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is the thrower that shoots the fireworks known as the Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
A Jewish film director criticized a Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from the Arab 'call' â€“ RT News
A French film director, whose roots are Jewish, gave birth to media rage after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's territory number in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, unsettled his frustration at the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
In his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of areas offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed â€“ as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel via a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response upset him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinsky Hotels".
The reason behind the operation further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code."
The Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great shame".
"We are all shocked and shocked by this incident.
It's a great shame.
And it is all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and that this is the very chain of hotels.
That's all we need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the web, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Damn" was said in a publication that brought out the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes the representative of Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area number has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets for demonstrations by Brazilian students.
In Sao Paulo, on Thursday, the students clashed with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot began when law enforcement officials tried to break up the student force, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to demonstrate their dismay at government plans took part in the demonstration.
Mr Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, has put forward a proposal for a austerity measure whereby nearly 100 public schools are closed and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls against Michel Temer, who was acting as President temporarily.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, when the Senate voted on an official charge against him.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% â€“ RT Business
Since the removal of sanctions, annual trade flows between Moscow and Tehran have increased by 70.9%, says Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $ 158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued around 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was for the first time among the first 20 countries whose citizens travelled in Russia.
And it is not too risky to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have maintained the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner scored the goal as the British won the gold of cycling
Scottish Callum Skinner drew attention to the reputation of the men's team print at Rio velodrom last night when the Great Britain trio defended the 2012 title in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow played the role of anchor that he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland. The young man made the legend proud as he raced to the finish line and captured the victory from the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished sixth in March at the World Rally Championship in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, the first leader.
Hindes came out just in time.
Hoy's decision to end his career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was the man that British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, made the Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And Britain's trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was close behind after his round, but Kenny struggled with the team leadership that Skinner kept.
A big part of the change was to change strategy so that Hindes drove the pace to a greater gear, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by the analogy.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record at the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he deliberately fell on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew, and Britain's rivals had no way to complain.
This time there were no problems of this kind associated with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all of the British flags were in the stands.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, we are facing a successful five-day velodrom.
As Kenny has shown by his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold at one Olympic Games.
This would mean an accumulation of six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medallions would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is for the sprint, which starts today and will be settled in three days.
Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team race is always the best.
You're gonna enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he's got to get the knight's rank."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in four-man team racing.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012, and which won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (at 22.42) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had an argument with the competitive operators before the time run when the trustees invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record date 4:13,260.
The British team can now count on its great track bike team to take over the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly extraordinary evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, amidst claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on velodrom on the first night show that Britain's already legendary reputation of rising to the top at the perfect moment is once again being realised.
The future of Portland's melting plant at stake as a result of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company supplying electricity to the melting plant told us that one of the factory's owners is winding down the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue the subsidies used to keep the factory in operation.
The fixed, 20-year grant will expire in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of closures.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting plant is losing money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
These measures correspond to the speculations that have been going on for years about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of its production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects that the other three owners of the melting plant will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is Alcoa and Alumina joint venture. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the plant.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant continues.
AGL reports that the contracts are so-called hedging contracts that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months and therefore ends in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects the contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017", says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million "in the form of an advance for the termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... capacity to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant".
The American company stated that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still has to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates both of the melting plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and of the plant in Tomaso, near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, the operational director of AGL, said in his speech to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomaso uses about 900 megawatts per year.
â€˜If these plants exit the market, this will mean a significant drop in demand (electricity) in the market.
As a producer, it would not be good news for us," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality TV star Kendall as Vogue cover girl of September
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and his mother and manager Kris's fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashiansian style?), a handwritten video showing all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar harrassers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten his sister's cover picture. The video ends in the classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichÃ© and is used in almost every birthday session of the degree programs (Seacrest says: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character of the children's morning TV), but Krisin had to get his other daughters into this publicity in some way.
For being present in the September issue of Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's cover before (he appeared on Vogue's cover together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold release in the year.
More photobooks than fashion magazines attract a large number of advertisers (the fashion site from Fashion calculated that last year's 832 page opus had 615 pages of advertising).
The release of the cover star of September is so intensely expected that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence were on cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga received the credit.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of his generation, and even if he were more of a model - making celebrity, he is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, reality TV stars or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if Jenner is all about these).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Last year, Beyonce, who appeared in the cover photo, has one of the strongest years of his career, when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of his reality-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, the constant squirming of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking around in Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the poster face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through pay-per-view applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, the one he was filming for the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he performs on reality TV, maybe just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160 000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people in the countries are turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the impact of further cuts in appropriations on centres already operating at the extremes.
In Queensland, three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services are already being turned away from five people â€“ most of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in the budget.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that thousands of people are already turned away from the centres each year, according to the latest report drawn up by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government doesn't twist its decision, Farrell says it'll only get worse.
"The Queensland Public Legal Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People leaving out of violent relationships, people under uncontrolled and crippling debt burdens, divorced families, workers who have been unduly laid off â€“ all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: An action was brought against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was supposed to have been taken after its management had been informed that the manager of North Carolina's campaign had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini in the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
My Bordin says that he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized, according to his own words, that this was not going to happen.
In his lawsuit, my Bord says that campaign manager Earl Phillip "put out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed a pipe into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint lodged with the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if a weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says my Bordini in his lawsuit.
The action comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he says to the crowd in North Carolina that 'the supporters of the second additional clause' â€“ who are considered to be gun owners and arms enthusiasts â€“ can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his words from the context and Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, my Bordin claims compensation from the campaign for indifference and Phillip for assault, assault and emotional suffering.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to a message asking him for a comment.
Phillip, despite his efforts, was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, received no immediate response to the call.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been conducting a controversial campaign.

Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being â€“ not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was the most interesting thing in Heathrow. As at the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to benefit our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who feel that Heathrow's expansion is too much of a challenge.
With regard to the Olympic Games, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question it asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by Â£ 211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a powerful task force at Heathrow, which has carried out on time and by keeping to the budget a Â£11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included the T5 terminal â€“ which has been voted the best airport terminal of the year for two consecutive years â€“ and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two most congested runways in the world.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of Â£16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook anti-advertising cat-mouse games
The attempts of companies that earn money from online advertising to distract anti-advertising software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it was blocking anti-advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog article where it told users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising labelling codes on its desktop website so that it would be harder to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock tells us he's got the new codes.
Adbuck's publicist, Ben Williams, wrote in his blog article that "this kind of balling between an open source anti-advertising community and deceivers has been going on since the invention of anti-advertising" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the concern that advertising agents have become in the sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising programs," says Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily on mobile devices by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in distracting anti-advertising programs in its desktop application, as according to the publicist, mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
Income from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it will update the user settings advertising tool so that users can control more how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adbrock's new filters as they also prevent the appearance of some common Facebook articles.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said Facebook's publicist in his email release.
"The anti-museum programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of eyewitnesses on the highway for the first hours of Thursday's accident, where a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in Vaud canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
A woman did her desperate work by laying down on a dark road, and several cars hit her, says Vaud's police officer in his press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear aim of committing suicide, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident are being prosecuted.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That remains to be determined by the prosecutor," says Hofstetter.
Over the last five years, two similar cases have occurred that do not hold drivers responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from the charge of death committed against him after he hit a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had drunk heavily and passed out on the road.
The Court considered that the way the police were driving, which was about to respond to the emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions in Venus could at times be similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is superficially hot and anhydrous and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to scientists' previous performances, Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and yet it has been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"In the GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daily life is almost two months per sun," says Anthony Del Genio, researcher at GISS in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is even a few degrees below the current temperature of the Earth.
The model was used to create Venus' story, which corresponds to earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its development.
Even though Venus may have been viable, for many billions of years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
In hydrogen's karate space, only a thick carbon - carbon - rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained â€” that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up his position as a coach at Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, claiming a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Deputy CEO/Director General of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've done my job as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the club's hockey operations with vigor, passion and determination," says Roy, age 50, in his communication.
"In the summer I have long and hard thought about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the deputy director-general of the club's hockey activities must be in complete agreement with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league for his first season as Avalanche's head coach in 2013â€“2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the extension period in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in 2015â€“2016 and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing from another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career â€“ two in the Montreal Canadiens ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators report that wage strikes for North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all the parties involved in the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been the subject of strikes on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, â€˜Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will have several meetings over the next few weeks that will take place throughout the day to deal with the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its North Sea contractors' tariffs by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is consistent with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the room to move, which is necessary to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced the number of thousands of employees on her payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thereby seeking to improve its operations with the UK energy company BG Group after its mega-merger.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the British decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with the workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not only few," says Anderson.
Under USD 1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared with around USD 7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejad star group
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the speed of rotation of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speed of rotation of the stars of the Plejades.
Based on new information, astronomers can determine why stars of the same star group rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age and even about the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at Caltech University's infrared processing and analysis centre in Pasadena in a press release.
The Plejades starbase is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars have been born some 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They're spinning faster than ever.
With the speed of rotation at its peak, large amounts of star winds erupt from the growing stars.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between identifying stars (which correspond to sunspots) appearing.
The latest recorded speed data indicate that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers â€“ the larger ones spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from Plejadie's "dance" that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Plejades' star cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Plejades' star cluster provides a support pillar for theoretical models of both younger and older stars, " says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Plejades in their three new articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
