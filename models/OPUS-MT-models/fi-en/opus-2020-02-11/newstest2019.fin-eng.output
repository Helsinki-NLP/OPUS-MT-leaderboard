Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
After seven consecutive men's volleyball championships, Hurricane-Loimaa started the season with a 2018-19 home win when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned to Finland from Romania, was 22 points the most efficient of Hurricanes.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't come true, and then a call came from Loisa.
Pretty fast we got things settled, Kouki said.
Tom Drumunen, who played in the Moimu, was like Kouk with 18 points in his support.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points, a national team chipper playing on a match-by-match agreement.
It's always important to win the opening game.
Many players had experience from the opposing team, and it brought extra edge to the game.
Our game is not yet finished, but continuing the medallion is of course a goal," Kouki said.
Stumping Savo Volley's most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most effective Savo Volley with 18 points when the team knocked down Vantaa's Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially at the head of the attack, but luckily we were able to squeeze in the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team," Määttanen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points in the 3 series.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
I left a good feeling at home.
Miro was the king, Silli also played a good game," Tuovinen said.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi Sammo when Tuovinen was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective Ducks ever had at 14 points.
Mikkonen's Star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, winner of the 2012-13 league spot exchange, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season's opening win after he fell the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for itself.
Today, of course, was close to defeat, because we were in the fourth round of defeat from 17 to 21.
We dug up some kind of batch profit, and the fifth round came along," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective tigers in the finals had been the feller Edwards Builders.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much hold of the guy's pick-up, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital world number one
Finland is the world leader in comparing human capital," says the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland ranked one higher and instead of Canada found Taiwan on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched to great fights, and the local game of Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois was able to fight back.
Courtois played at Atletico for three seasons while he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, Fifa, the International Football Federation, chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the goal opening half.
After the break, Bale was left in exchange for a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned Realists cried out in the fight the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - A powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected to the candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will be able to reverse the decision known as Roe vs. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - the United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (s) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been the only abortion doctor in Missouri because of the blackmail of the laws.
An armed security guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The interviewed pastor's arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of the abortion itself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States every year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to mix religion in politics with voters.
His abortion position was also rotated by his successor George Bush Senior.
And Donald Trump did the same thing.
The document reaches the deepest point of the matter in its search for a reason for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When the tax exemption was denied to religious organizations in favour of segregation, it became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
When writing this, there is a situation in the USA where the President, who has boasted with his sexual harassment, but who has caught the voices of the religious right with his abortion attitude, has elected Mr Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by many women, to the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the status of scales.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large demonstrations at the border
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has fired on protestors in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says they've started using force so that protestors don't break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March when the Palestinians started the weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12 000 wounded.
The demonstrators called for access to Palestinian families in areas where Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped on kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have set fire to forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick. He couldn't get himself shot.
Looks like Wigan's top Chey Dunkley knocked him down with a hit from behind in the penalty zone.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think it's just a matter of time before Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick for the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me a penalty spot, and Mario Vranc hit a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
Work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended them tirelessly.
For Norwich, the fight was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The pedophile help service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40 000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women have at least some sexual interest in pre-school children.
In Finland this means about 40 000 people.
Up to now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
A joint Serie project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of e-mails and meeting times was set aside very quickly in Sexpo, offering advice and therapy," Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Many are ashamed of their sexual preference for children.
Most of those who observe pedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life," says Yle's sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Chore leaders or Congo gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound a little strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize based on betting odds.
The background lies in Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The main favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are, on the basis of the odds, the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the cores is considerable, as last year the gap was still icy.
Yet, the reward of Kim, who has been threatening his country with nuclear weapons for years and with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also be a source of criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday onwards, and Friday will be the most prominent, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in Korean diplomacy, there will be one of the leading candidates for the Congon doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo in his hospital and has become the world's leading expert in his field.
Mukwege has done his work to draw attention to sexual violence, which is a horrifying by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has told us that there are 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind having a Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him at the White House if he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the North Korean negotiations.
But there are some things that make Trump's Nobel Prize improbable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which will decide on the prize, has often recognised people and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-polar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen to oppose.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require an ideological reverse of the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists acted like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja Street 1 took place on September 8th.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to normalize traffic.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened because there were drivers in the road and they were driving as they should, Pasi Kääriäinen, on duty, told STT freshly.
At that time the motorway was even going in the wrong direction only after waiting.
When the first takes action against traffic rules, some others often follow, Tapio Heiskanen, the contact manager of Traffic Security, is amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for more than a compelling reason.
Road safety points out that, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible access possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is particularly prohibited, as is the making and cancellation of the U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
In recent times, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow out of his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action," Heiskanen says in the Road Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake.
Ilves fans carried by inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's master at the time.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of its bow at Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the hay.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and by bus home," Syrja said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's Hade was due to the fact that the water surface in the Vanajavesi was about a half meter lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered with loggings and therefore its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No further impact
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the shipping route had submerged the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrja, there was no greater drama, as the speed of the ship at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom was not more significant.
According to the remote, getting caught at the bottom of the ship has not caused any leaks or depressions, and the cruises of the ship will continue as usual.
On Saturday morning the diver visited to check the condition of the ship before the ship began to be towed off the shallows.
To be sure, we will still visit the yard to check that this did not cause any damage," says Syrja.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S Tampere cruise scheduled for next weekend can be arranged.
According to him, the cruise season of the ship will continue until the Fourth of July.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alarm on Saturday night just after 9:30.
The port of Viila was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call firemaster Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the conditions for evacuation at the lake were difficult due to darkness and a rather heavy wind.
After 2:30 p.m., Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on the night against Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Cruisers built in 1957 have been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's candidate for a judge accused of harassment and drinking may be left out of a state-of-the-art position
Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well be missing the post he is seeking, says programme director Mika Aaltola from the International Political Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up representing another person.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time that the President's candidate for the Supreme Court has caused a great deal of conflict.
In this case, the candidate for a judge has usually withdrawn himself," says Aaltola.
This has enabled the president to keep his face.
The name would rain on the Democratic laurels.
The United States Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but, at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party's laarie in the upcoming Congressional elections.
This would increase the turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
An appointment will not be possible for every presidency, since in the United States the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
Some Republicans also hesitated to be called
The US Supreme Court judges will normally be given a background check," says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a week's deadline for further clarification by the FBI, Aaltola says that it can bring up something essential.
Yeah, it might.
Rarely is smoke without fire," says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for office is still under lively discussion before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republicans are thought to be sceptical about the appointment of Kavanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman identified a suspected Salisbury military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of being poisoned by Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman told me that this was a military reconnaissance at the GRU, Anatoly Tshepiga.
The Internet community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported that they had previously revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Tshepiga.
Even earlier, they said that they had found evidence that men's present identities were aliases.
The BBC group travelled to a village near the Russian-China border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized young Tshepigan from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the pictures of the British police who presented the man who now called Ruslan Boshirov himself.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Script and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's medal in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect's GRU connection.
Earlier in September, suspected men reported having been tourists in Salisbury in an interview with Russian television.
Old people in throwing bags in social renewal
There is now a living example of what the change limiter for the social reform defined by Sipilä's government means in practice.
My municipality Vaala's sote services are produced by Oulunkaari municipal association, whose health service leader has been elected as the former regional director of Atttendo in 2016.
The heads of the municipal association warn the council of the change limiter.
If there is now a rise in social spending, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of care for the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care at the health centre and a small unit for the elderly.
Home care would be increased, which means in Vaala long distances that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots next to the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay for its customers.
The left of the whale did not swallow poor preparation, but organised a good public event with a large number of relatives, carers and also delegates from other parties.
I introduced the dictions of the preparation of the sote region, how the elderly are already treated most at home in the municipality of Vaala in Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a councilman named Carina Westinen.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it brought Oulunkaar's draftmen to their hind legs.
Sote preparers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
Preparatorys only talk about a service voucher, but do not tell what level of care it will provide or what kind of staffing Attendo will be able to treat the elderly until they are escorted.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the facilities at the health centre will be stopped because there is no doctor's emergency room at night.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run delegates with incomplete information and the delegates are put back against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party clears out the residents of Vaala, because who stays there unsafe if there is a chance to move out.
Was there one vote in the city center to keep the whole country inhabited?
President Erdogan of Turkey opened a large mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people showed themselves when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened up one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered at the river Rhine since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the protesters' signs, and slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday several demonstrations have taken place and the security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to protest against the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and felt that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild their relations with the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
Mr Merkel stressed, however, that there were deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Review Surrounded by Visits
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three are charged with the murder of a journalist.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told me that three people were charged with the murder of Kucik and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week the police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava in February.
He had investigated the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murders had something to do with Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in scattered settlements
Due to the printing problem, Karelian on Sunday will also have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in the magazine's distribution in scattered settlements where the distribution of common boxes is carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra paper bundles in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala, among others, in her upcoming discussion program.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip that she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan to pay for.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014, which also claimed the death penalty, things are going well.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, which means that his journey dates about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about its upcoming website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and I saw Star Trek on TV.
We've seen the war of the stars, and that's where the idea stuck.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its lossless course in the Champions League as it fell on its home field in Brighton 2-0.
The sixth victory of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by the paint sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at the back of Brighton's goal for 30 minutes.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling saw Brighton defense to pieces in 65 minutes.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 final readings on the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, the season-started City will lead the Champion League with 19 points in catch.
However, Liverpool, who has less than one game, is only one point away.
Liverpool will meet a series three Chelsea on Saturday night in his seventh round match.
New decision-makers were selected by youth clubs in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Associations chose new decision-makers for their next three-year period for the years 2019-2021 at their meeting which ended on Sunday.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected president and vice-chairman Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The Board of Governors was elected 40 full members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Associations informs on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal activities regardless of the municipality of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth Associations in their press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was amazed at Ferrari: " Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of Mercedes was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari told us that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the counter with gloves.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming about Formula One, I played F1 all day on PlayStation.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sectional.
The race starts at 2 p.m. from the paalue to Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes.
The tabloid follows the race every minute of the day.
Football A Youth Championships became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the 13 o'clock round, the starting points for the championship struggle were clear: FC Lahti Academy will be able to make a point against Vasa IFK.
In order to change the situation in the last round, Ilves, who is the second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and wish the Gulfs a defeat.
In practice, however, the Lahti Championship was confirmed before the opening whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vases, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won 16-0.
At the break, the bayers led a 7-0.
One reason why the stakers lose their players is that the team has played part of the same players in the A-youth SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Two-C block.
Vasa IFK has played in Two against practically the fall of the entire season.
On Saturday's final round, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFu in Toivala, Lake Siilin.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno. According to the rescue department, luck was involved.
The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof at Eno's Casefell on Sunday around 9 o'clock.
There were four persons involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the emergency services reported.
Good luck was in it, the release states.
According to the Rescue Department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of intelligence: Equipment procurements and recruitments already made, planning abroad activities will not be mentioned
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, there would be a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million in the budget of the Supon.
At the premises of the Protection Police (supon) in Ratakadu, Helsinki, full preparations are already being made for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Peltari, Head of Supo's Assembly, tells the West Media that there have already been purchases of equipment for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video of her singing topless campaigns for breast cancer awareness.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is turning on again.
Now he's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts," reports AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit by the Australian, The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association's activities.
"I voted for The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to carry out regular self-intentional [breast] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do so because the subject affects all women regardless of the color of their skin all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
The Divinyls song is written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the comments on the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
In the background, there is a fuss at the US Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams became enraged with the chief judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted for far more violent conduct than women players.
Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not suitable for high-feared people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located on the cliff.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
Rotten landscapes in high altitudes make restaurant visitors yawn their breaths in the mountains of Longquan.
To get to the restaurant, you need to wander around the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is located.
Hiking to a restaurant requires good condition, the place is told.
The Korpela alley runs out today: This is how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to domestic country drama, the Korpela alley, which has been quite popular.
The third period of production has gone like hot stones: last week the episode was seen on TV with 722 000 Finns.
The peaks in themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to continue.
In the final episode, the relationship between Jaska and Mirku is once again taking a big leap forward, and I think Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's coming.
Even between Anssi and Misa are warm, in the light of recent events, romantic, but then once again Laiho appears in the picture.
Even the police are skeptical about a man.
Still, no one knows what's gonna happen to you in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear incredible news.
The last will of the long distance will come out, which will bring a woman to tears.
In a week's time, Sunday evenings will continue with the latest episode of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV 1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of lotteries stay home or not.
However, the working mole should consider whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small," says the Prevention publication.
So you think it's worth staying home?
According to the Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is contagious the day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when your cough relaxes and there is no fever anymore," says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to return to the gym will slow the recovery.
Remember, too, to wash your hands, toss your handkerchief and throw your snot paper in the trash.
Painful to move, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited with mask.
How, then, can you avoid infections?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missi tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the Misses are often linked.
This also happened with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland's crown was wetted by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Inkerinsuomalainen and her father is Russian.
My father's Russianism, Voronkov, was being bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all," Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists at the Miss Suomi competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, Miss Beauty found new friends, and the ark started rolling as desired.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, familiar with Pelicans.
SM League after a career hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distant relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning three and get a career with it, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about a distance relationship is that it keeps up with the whole time, Alina grint in May.
With continued growth with joy, death upon us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's resilience.
Still, there's very little you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but the theory of reasonable economics also runs into major problems.
In a few generations, continued economic growth has brought to ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-term exceedance of earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening this rock foot of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed on the night against Sunday in Kannelma at Sitrator at 4:00 in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured by a stabbing and another one, born less so in 1968.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose potential contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
Events are being investigated as attempted homicide and aggravated assault.

The leaf showed its underpower, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehtä's strong underpower play arose when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training game before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and the Widow fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehtar has been on display for suspicions of narcotics.

According to Carchid, the Lehtar was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehter fought the puck for himself underpower, pulled the defenseman on him and fed Raffl, who was waiting for the goal, to the open place.
For the second time, the two-man cooperation scored the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th in a guest match against Las Vegas.

Now it's up to the coaches to decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Librare said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.

The latest image shows the change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the world's strongest man's title long and determined.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos at its most.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before the title was won, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size," Hall said.
The British hunted the most powerful man in the world with every effort, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen at the world's strongest man competition in April 2018.
Just now, Hall published an Instagram photo of him posing in a much thinner condition than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he's now training five times a week in aerobics.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was push-ups by an Icelandic, also familiar with Game of Thrones TV series Hafér Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the rocks at Pyhäjärvi - "Standingly attached to the rock"
Inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday night in Akaa Lake Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident Friday night after 11:30.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted off the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the stone, says firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship was carried by 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the Rescue Department, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere," said Chief Officer Jari Nieminen to STT after 1:00 in the night.
Ambulances were alerted to evacuate passengers at the port of Viila.
For some reason, the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route to the west of Jumusensalmi.
The police will find out what happened.
Matti Willman, on-call firefighter, told us earlier last night that the conditions in the lake are difficult due to darkness and quite heavy wind.
According to the Rescue Department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently a restaurant-based inland waterway vessel with a maximum authorised passenger volume of 180 persons.
The ship also has a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The fight against Erkan Teper tonight by Robert Helenius is overshadowed by a financial dispute.
The evening Sanomat announces today about the challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius will be charged a total of over €80,000 in unpaid management fees with interest on late payments.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to the Iltalehti, which tells the boxer's view of events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a difficult financial situation and promised to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was literally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay only a percentage of the fees for his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive their income.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salaried work has never been agreed and it would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation," Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not produce the draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was poor and that he stopped working with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought in his dealings with Kokkila and Helmiinen.
One year after the end of the cooperation Helenius had been given an "indeed but large" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers the ex-post activities of Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius today meets the heavyweight challenger list of the IBF in Erkan Teper Stuttgart, the seventh.
A Hearty Man and a Good Journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The plotner's obituary was published in the Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The announcement says Päll died September 3rd.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the acquaintance's fate.
He said goodbye on Facebook earlier," says Ile Vainio.
The Vainio sees Erkki Päll as a multi-talented talent who became a great journalist.
He remembers Pälli was a liked person with fast rhumbs and funny things.
I got to know Erk when I was a little boy when I first went to Finn album at the age of 12 and started there as a storage man.
Erk and I met back then.
At the time, he was Finn album's publicist, and he was in various positions," says Ile Vainio.
When I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the parties doing stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how big a fire he was in entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio driver, but he also wrote wonderful articles in the press.
Erkki interviewed me several times too.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje in the Fazer record company in addition to journalistic work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
But his greatest passion was the radio work, where he had an original style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the Finnish Ski Association's annual period ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as a 'full turn', although the economy is, of course, burdened by 'substantial debt in the balance sheet'.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises quick reaction and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted as quickly as possible to the situation by making adjustments.
Careful planning of operations and financial management have been instilled throughout our organization," Kulmala says in the release.
We have also succeeded well in the acquisition of partners and, in addition, the world cup yield was maximum during the past period of competition.
However, we must continue to be careful about cost management and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was a silence.
Tens of bodies lie in the hospital's backyard in the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injury and need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of the people who moved around the hospital area was a 52-year-old pal named Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses just one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the AFP news agency.
In the courtyard of the military hospital in Palu was Dwi Haris, who has been injured in his back and arm.
At the beginning of the quake, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to a wedding party in Paluu.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe, told Haris news agency AP according to the British media.
Small shops are being robbed
At the Palu Evac Center, 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many of Palu's inhabitants have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house were somehow upright, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in Palu Prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Also, some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to leave for their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first, an army C-130 transport plane landed on the field, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots have to land on the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the tower was badly damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night against Sunday, a long rainy area is spreading from westward, says the Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but it is expected to run or snow in Central and North Lapland.
The frosty temperatures of the previous night are not repeating, as under a cloud blanket temperatures remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty much under control.
In the west, we can temporarily go to the cold side," said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will move east during the morning.
In the south and west there are potty or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu about 10-13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typical autumn weather.
That fall is really starting to push on now," Ilkka said.
Miss Finland finals are not seen on TV
IL-TV gives you access to the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Suomi competition.
Tonight's entertainment editors broadcast live on IL-TV from the red carpet of Miss Suomi's finale Billnäs.
We'll start at 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday with ten finalists.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final will be held at Billnäs's Ruukke in Raasepor.
Before the finals begin, you will be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot in the live broadcast of IL-TV.
Live transmission starts at approximately 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, especially many Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, welfare entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, CEO of Joun's Store and Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before we went to the Missile Games.
The Russian father Dimitri and the Indian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
The parents of Miss Finland Alina Voronkov Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov were proud to follow her daughter's first moments in the crown head.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erik all the time, but half an hour before we came in, she was laughing.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was more interested in acting when she was a kid than in miss' career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got into the beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to be admitted to the university before attending the Miss Suomi competition.
That was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to take the Kandi degree before the Missile Games.
We asked him why he wasn't taking part last year, but he wanted to finish the candi.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults as well.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, you can see it.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, plays hockey in Japan for a living, and she did not get to encourage her love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that a young person's relationship lasts a Miss Year.
Yes, that's the idea!
Parents hoped that their daughter would soon be able to visit.
It's been such a long break since I've been here because of the missis.
I've already missed you. I've been texting you.

According to the police, three people have been apprehended as a result of the incident.
On Saturday Häme's police did not comment on the course of events and on the possible intent of the hit-and-run on the basis of the incompleteness of the investigation.
The police also did not comment on whether the apprehended persons and the man who died in the hit-and-run knew each other from before.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Pippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: The lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic nonsense left my husband's statement in which he suggested it as a person for the story I was working on," says Sari Pippo, an Espoan comic blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Pippo says that she was an economic and legal translator in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a housewife so much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me, "What would you do when you grow up when even the smallest child started to be big?"
Then a comic book came into the picture in 2014.
Pippo tells us that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tintti, and Asterix since childhood.
The last time I had drawn was when I was a child, but when these manuscripts started to come out of organic smoke, things changed.
At first I made some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I couldn't lure her into it until summer 2016 when I was making a donation with a record sheet.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strippers, and then I had to start trying myself, laughing Pippo, who tells me that the record was a great incentive for him.
The disc is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper," says Pippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop up all the time, but I don't usually finish at once.
One strip of three screens takes up to several hours.
I might do a screen at a time, and I'd love to play with the colors.
It's always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing isn't my strongest species.
Sari Pippo says that he appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among other things.
The characters of the organic are the carrot - body mother with the salad hair.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from personal life and social media.
Sari Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bull's-eye, even if it's between an intruder and an intruder.
The bishop tells us he's reading his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing and you're like, "This is what I've done today."
And there's plenty of challenges for a housewife!

The Indonesian earthquake, the air traffic controller sacrificed himself, never left a crackling tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
A 21-year-old air traffic controller named Anthony Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people off an earthquake - shaken island.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in Palu city when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before he could control Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was shaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
Her leg was broken and she suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a representative of the Aviation Administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to increase after the flight reached the air and was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Mr Rehn wondered about Europe's ending in a trade war: "You have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
In Yle's first morning, President Olli Rehn said that even though tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is so far a great talent.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be rumbling over a trade war.
We'll have to watch the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted violently to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan portfolio is problem credit and unstructured credit is over ten per cent.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps there is no point in painting yet another crisis, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that is testing Europe is Britain's separation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in harmony.
A difference in dispute would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just over a year's time.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in.
I don't think it's a problem if Finnish names are involved," Rehn said, adding that he will not comment further.
HS Super Popular Black Box performances will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23 Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long-standing story that has not previously been published in any of the HS instruments.
There's something else that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from across the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS editors and photographers and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has arranged nights of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The content of the proposal to be presented at that time is different from that of the evenings of this autumn.
The missing sponger was found because of a "unprejudiced experiment"
The skills of the Finnish police are among the top in the world: "We are being asked for training"
According to the headmaster of the Police Academy of Applied Sciences, police can use drones in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing sponger with drone in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Head of Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are also the world's leading player here".
Drone is a very new thing and even more recent in police duty.
Nowhere is there any statistics that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest elsewhere," Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to see the Finnish police's drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
Getting even more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland is very important as soon as possible.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Even now, drones are being used extensively in police missions, and their use will become more widespread and increasing in the future.
This is what I would dare to say," says Himberg.
In addition to the search for the missing persons, Himberg says that the police can use drones, such as accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence missions.
For example, we need to go a little further to check a certain area, where there may be fears that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for pre-inquiry purposes.
Rugby of Karelia rose to the number one divariate
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuers were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second period, and the guests from the south were 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew that Karelian Rugby had a historic rise in the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at the time Finnish rugby's serial activities were divided into two levels, the SM series and several blocks of 1 divisions.
The club is going to accept the venue, but it's going to be quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms the head coach
The head coach Claude Julien of the Montreal Canadiens playing hockey in the NHL confirmed the club's Twitter account that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal made a super promise to Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round number three at the summer reservation.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has made strong demands in the September training matches.
In his first training match, the Eagleniemi managed to score a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish people for taking big developments after arriving at the new arrival camp.
The NHL regular season starts next week on the night of Thursday.
Montreal will face the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week, a lot has been said about leadership in Finland.
In an interview with HS, the Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, Risto Siilasmaa, described his book Paranoid's optimist, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia studies have also mentioned the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking ability and agility of the company's upswing phase disappeared.
During the week Nordic Business Forum was also organised in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to the fair centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business world stars rose to the stage.
There was enough talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader must be brave enough to take the company into the future, even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods chain, known for a wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of a success book on introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are studied as being humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodaran recalled that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the life cycle of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of having an information signal.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They used to talk to each other in front of each other in a friendly way.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived in a red carpet right out of Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a laced drag.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what he's doing.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for auditions.
Among other things, he's been doing ad shoots.
His work in the United States describes his work as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, work needs to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for model work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30,000 Euro Live Art Prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a 30,000-euro cultural prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art winner Lindfors works on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her immediate surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments that they have previously interfered with, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for in the big operation: "We can't tell you where"
The Danish police's extensive search has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlan was closed in Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The I.S. reached out to the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
They found the car they were looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henry Storm of the Copenhagen Police Department will tell Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
An extra Bladet from Denmark told me about a police briefing on Saturday.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of crime he was working on.
But Skov told me it was a serious crime.
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public has no cause for concern, as certain people were threatened.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of disunity - now the people are voting in controversial elections
A proposal for a new name is currently being put to the vote in Macedonia in the Balkans.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the Republic of Northern Macedonia would be named.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but is asked whether the electorate is in favour of Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
The vote took place slowly, at least at the school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for young people," he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has been officially designated as an independent country since 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is a great deal of tension as to whether the turnout exceeds the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to change the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also still has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
That's a handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
A 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, on the side of Stuttgart.
Tonight's main match was the heavyweight Intercontinental match of the IBF Federation.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to get to fight in tougher positions than those seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand punch.
She couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" already hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They were due to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the fight.
After that, it turned out that the German had been burned twice in the drug test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with a stable order to win - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One Championship was once again approaching confirmation, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and stretched his World Cup point lead to Ferrari Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There's only five cats left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole seat in the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who had won his first career, held a leading position near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton go.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started the last line of departure, was the fifth.
Two of them beat up a Jukaman in Joensuu. They caught him a block away.
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6:00.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim's phone.
The police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with a haystack, and a 39-year-old man in Homomants, a block away from the scene.
They were captured as a suspect in a robbery, the police say.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, leaves his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
The US Securities Commission has accused Muski of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be the CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting time to reach peace with the United States of America.
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sundays and their negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian main negotiator, Minister for Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations at full weight.
At the request of President Donald Trump, about a year ago, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
Neighbor thought the candles were slicing into a fire in the Kakkuri. The fire department was alerted to the scene.
The candles burned in an apartment apartment in Kaakkkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue unit units were alerted to a possible apartment building fire.
On the spot, it was discovered that candles burned in the apartment sauna had looked like a fire in the house across the street, which was why the emergency room had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
The police caught 11 people after the Honka-HJK game... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The police caught eleven people on Saturday after the men's football league Honka-HJK game in Espoo, the crime commissioner Teemu Värtinen of the Western Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection against crime and disorder.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down," Värtinen said.
The arrests were reported earlier by the Evening Sanomat.
The fight ended at 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed into the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between team supporters.
Among other things, cavalry police were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, there was brawling in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the catchers also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the brawl in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
The table stone hastened its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam into the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have progressed to finals on the closing day of World Cup 3/7 in Holland.
The games will be swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The table stone of HSS hastened Finland's record in the 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the first period of 22.82.
Previously in September Tablestone swims in Helsinki during the SE season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24.68 in the 24th time of butterfly swimming.
Swimming Club Vuokatti's Laukkanen was 30.48 in the first half of the 50-metre breast swim and went to the finals.
In the early stages of two hundred meters of mixed swimming Laukkanen was the 15th time 2.14.25.
Students perform a rare treat: The ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia is influenced by its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre last saw the ancient tragedy of Sofokleen Filoktetes in 1988.
Now the Academy of Theatre brought to the tour the only play trilogy in ancient history, Aiskhylus Oresteia.
In the Lavat open! projects that started in 2015, the actors students of the Theatre Academy work with a professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, like the first one, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia was awarded her international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roihan's agreement on Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to a fine hour and twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the chorus sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simoni's fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the exhibition of the theatre space highlight simplified and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between performers who break out of the choir, who play name roles, and the choir.
Both double and triple seats are used for the performance.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, returning from the war in Troy, are also shown on the scene, contrary to the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not stress its loyalty to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring up a rhythmic group of Master's degree actress students as a close group, one organism in fact.
Especially in choir sections, actors who are flexiblely inclined to a very expressive, sculpture-like group formations get their rights on a bare stage, only with a white curtain adorned.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new features are beginning to emerge in Europe, particularly thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded between Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a thousand-car brand-new models for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell-powered truck on the market, Hyundai continues with Nexo and ix35-Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network," said In Cheol Lee, Hyundai Motor's Vice President at the announcement of the contract.
The fists flashed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30 ' s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaani and outside it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser struck him too.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to jail to calm him down.
The case is being investigated as three assaults and violent protests against an official.
In the center of Kajaani, there was another assault on Väykatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaan man struck the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him earlier kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and a police officer called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigation.kainuu@politi.fi.
The long line radio host, Erkki Pälli, is dead.
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
We're done here.
Even the doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of shop aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I received a salary for a newspaper article.
When you're surprised at a subject on these rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karyan, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry for a moment.
I also spoke with Erika Kähära, working environment expert of the Service Federation (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us what's really going on.
The problem is growing, although employers claim otherwise, of course.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly perceived as serious, and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies are obliged to record their near-miss status under the Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, the problem has always been that they do not always result in physical injuries.
Nevertheless, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level must be counted as violence - even if there is no attack.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even though there is no actual act.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got security.
As the opening hours of the shops were released, the media also showed a lot of its effects on the security of the sellers.
"Then quite a few employers arranged security services for hours at least at night and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When the security situation kept well under control, the impression came that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a crime against the plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was abused does not wish to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
However, according to the same point of the 2011 Act, minor abuse becomes a matter for the prosecutor if it takes place at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused at the store, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should blame him.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and sentence from the severe end of the penalty scale, customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store is supposed to be open in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast started - "Sara, Iiro will be married"
Miss's coronation is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat's and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host came and told the invited guests and media representatives about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this guy we've got here. Sohlberg was glowing his colleague while the crowd was cheering.
Many previous years of Miss Finland will follow the front row races.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction or the other.
Sara, Iiro's married!
Sohlberg was crumbling towards Saras.
Most likely, Mr Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
This was the first time that the Sieppi talked about his divorce in the Evening Sanomat's weekend paper.
The Missikaunotar told me that she doesn't want to open up the reasons for the divorce more specifically in public, because that's between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not busy with a new relationship. He's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially starting to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marital status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
He was laughing at the screw-up.
Iiro was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the mistake.
The bottom man tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes committed against his common-law spouse.
Among other things, a belt, a cable, and a bunch of ties were used as a means of committing crime.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the State.
The criminal charge against him was about a suspect in a felony rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
The Kokkolaan was accused of four assaults, aggravated assaults, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the final act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of this week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered a 34-year-old to continue to be held in prison in Vaasa.
No evidence of rape.
A 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and a aggravated rape on May 22nd.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven.
The case was handled in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
By his sentence, the court ordered the state to be deprived of criminal equipment: belt and cable, zip ties, bathrobe belt, knife, and pruning machine.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between acts.
It can be read in the judgment that a large proportion of the most gross crimes occurred at the end of the crime cycle.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old person must pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm for a total of EUR 5800.
That is hardly the money he has, since the condemned person already has debts in recovery.
The prison sentence is not his first.
The evening paper does not mention the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent district court sentence is not final when you write this.
Europe leading the four-point Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional punch match against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6, while on Sunday there will be twelve doubles to play.
Europe won three out of four of the four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-player game the winnings were evened out 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the duo will pursue more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and there are only three players in America: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka game: "Voice does not belong in football"
The football betting league team HJK published a press release on Sunday condemning their supporters' behaviour in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for what happened after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the fight, some 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers did not calm the situation down but needed police officers and also the cavalry police.
HJK says in his announcement that the players and staff members of the team are shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old society.
"We are categorically dissociating ourselves from any activity that jeopardises the security of the match events", states the press release.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organizers to identify security threats and eliminate mild phenomena.
Proponent culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyful and encouraging action in football stands.
"The violence is not part of it," says the press release.

He now belongs to a growing group of people in the world who swears that he's invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his property building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flew his device at altitudes of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will give rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow's industrial action will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime and shift change will start tomorrow, especially in social services, health services and day care for children," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to wonder how to get their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened," says Niemi-Laine to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from working overtime and shift change due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to employ staff but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
It is a norm, from a health and safety point of view, that for every employee, regular working hours are taken care of and only done.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies against dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market manager of municipal employers, does not make a preliminary assessment of the effects of the bans on overtime and shift change.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so wide-ranging, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts may vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that there have already been experience in last week, for example, of activities such as the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and the Trade Union for Social Affairs and Health Tehy's three days of work.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift change applies to employees in municipalities, church, state and private social and health care sectors.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100 000 JHL members are involved in the collective struggle.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's activities may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Employment Act continues.
The government should now admit that we're running into a wall and running fast.
He believes that both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
The strange thing is that the tough ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is born with the strength of children and adults in the fitness circles of the show, studying the gestures of skates and seahorses.
The Great Coral reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is a lot of fairy tale magic in theatre play for children's participants as well.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral reef is not a children's performance but a performance that adults and children do in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations about how children receive information and do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practices and common games also relaxes the distance between adults and children.
In fact, the Great Coral reef is somewhat like a fairytale, fitness district and nature-related information attack, but it is once and for all tuned up in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The large coral reef begins by familiarizing itself with the motion courses of corals and coral reefs.
In six different fitness districts, you learn the gestures of skates and seahorses, among others.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour in which music, lights, shiny paints and costumes help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef as well as corals that are being considered.
In addition, there are coral - looking organisms.
The sights and observations in many directions make the performance dense and lifelike.
Whether to be a landscape of an organism, a landscape - looking organism, and another living organism or landscape looking at it all at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult at all.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitratori will host a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
Man's destruction beyond understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to comprehend the significance of exercising one's own compassion in front of the prospects of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including through political gestures.
There are other generations, other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations of those whose wonder and play it clears the way.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smart phones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me he had to pick up his fifth grade sister this weekend at the "boyfriend."
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is a grown-up thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood and that they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure of friends.
I keep seeing younger girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal in the evenings.
It's harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and even parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smart phones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people would think about me.
Yle: The authorities informed the government that the Airiston Helmi case had nothing to do with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva interviewed by Yle, the protection police and the armed forces visited the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of Airisto Helmi is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (kok).
According to Kanerva, the armed forces and the protection police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that this was anything else," Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
To date, there has been no evidence of a link with national security, but the investigation has only begun.
There is no way to know what can be revealed there yet," says one of Yle's interviewees.
A week ago, extensive home searches started in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere financial crime or a threat to Finnish internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening paper compiled a case that examines claims both for and against.
Video: Dream paint saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool's 100 percent start of the Champion League was completed, but it was still more satisfied with team 1-1 on the Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combo sent a signal to the whole Valio league that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jörgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Champions League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be alone in controlling his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great guest victory on Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in on it from the very beginning.
For the 25th minute, he first threw a triangular game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho in a small space.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard dive forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but then bombed the perfect left leg bet at the rear corner.
Pool's brass guard, Alison, was a little slow in the fight, and all she could get was her finger in the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the position of defeat lightly unfair because almost immediately Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's direction from the finish line.
During the second period, Chelsea Veskar Kepa also got real action.
The Basque watch reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into an angle kick.
At the other end, Alison zeroed her throw-through to Hazard.
The best place for guests came in at 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino in his concentration.
However, the Brass Star's bush was directed toward the national teammate David Luiz, who saved the host leadership.
Even that did not last another 89 minutes when replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the irresistible bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end on 1-1, but it's still on the league tip together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the tip.
The clock transfer conversation is full of potters.
I remember a few decades ago when a magazine asked different Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Wiskine's answer was the only one left in her mind: the Nen terminal.
Some people's last name has a nun terminal and some don't.
I mean, there could be divisions anywhere, and here was one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has brought about the abolition of the annual shift of clocks.
A lot of people agree that changing watches twice a year has been a fool's job and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement at least seems to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time to end up at: the present summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
The people can also express their opinion on this on the otaskanta.fi page.
The questionnaire was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is intense in coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend wintertime justify their position with the effect of morning light on people's well-being and summer time are defending the effect of evening light on people's desire to walk and thus well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light rhythmizes man's day and gives refreshment.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, the lightness increases people's outdoors and provides better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The number of additional lights after a normal working day has already been calculated to its class.
I'd prefer to take both, but unfortunately, our location in the northern part of the earth is beyond our control.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of the debate on this subject that one's own vision is being pursued and the other's views are being strongly opposed.
You don't listen to the arguments of the opposite party much, because the most important thing is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, there is little point in trying to turn the other person's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of dedication and it is enough to justify a mutu feeling.
Similar issues are generally the most controversial and equally infertile.
Well, it's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we can adapt to that too.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close guest victory.
Josba's first guest game in the hall band at Divar produced a full three-series score against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
The 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
Both teams were on ice playing decisive minutes at a flat shed.
The most effective of Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was already strong when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in chain two at the time of his goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
Next up comes O2-Jyväskylä with guests in two weeks.
Eno's Church Sunday 200th birthday party
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a somewhat sad mood.
A week ago, the arson of the Church of Tragedy was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
In spite of the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wanted to, the church of Eno is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other connections of all the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 o'clock.
After that, we move to the parish hall by the Karelian banquet table.
There are all kinds of things in and out of the show all day long.
For example, you can get to know the church building with Ari Räsänen, who has retired for 37 years as parish master.
The birth celebration of the church also marks the end of an era.
The church house, built in 1982, has already been decommissioned for the last time today.
We are now in evasive spaces at the former municipal hall," says Kappalainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor problems, but the church has been standing healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk withdraws from the chair of Tesla's government - Fraud charges were settled for $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have agreed their case with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined as a result of the company he founded.
But Musk can continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to leave the chair of Tesla's government for three years.
The company has to hire the chairman of an external board.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent directors and to monitor Muski's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the Bureau, the TVite was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential sponsors.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that they were suing the company and Musk.
The SEC claimed that Musk would be fined and that he would be banned from running listed companies any longer.
The SEC's challenge frightened the investors, and Tesla's stock went into a sharp decline.
More than 800 people died in Indonesia's quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, the country's disaster agency.
The number of deaths is believed to be increasing, as the destruction is still ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued about Tsunami, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, Plausa.
The rescue services are concerned, among other things, with the Donggala area, which is close to the heart of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to have died.
Raunias Requests for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived today in the Extermination Area, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work day and night without fatigue.
One of the central points of the rescue work is the Palu hotel, where it is believed that there are still 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, reported that one person was found alive in the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, which was popular for business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to Syagi, heavy cleaning equipment would be needed quickly in the earthquake and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you guys in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family is still missing, and one of the writers appealed to Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts were leaked because of shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The troublemakers were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
It was an application used at the British Conservative Party Assembly in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, were subject to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the audience was able to access the politicians' profiles in the mobile application of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily available online.
The person entering the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile photo for a moment to a porn image and title insult.
Michael Goven's profile photo was replaced by a media mogul Rupert Murdoch photo.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the loginer can view the profile person's contact details and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting application made every journalist, politician and participant's telephone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative spokesman apologized for the breach of information.
He said that technical problems were solved and the application now works safely.
The British Information Authority, ICO, supports the data leak.
The application was made by an Australian company called Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
There are a large number of applauding Poles every week in the audience of The Wall Suomi.
Watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Suomi.
The rapidly spread American format The Wall landed in the Finnish version of Number Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions are made in the format.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, social media highlighted the studio audience of the program, which was thought to be Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether Poles who may be sitting in the studio understand anything about a game to play in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programs at Number Four, illustrates the matter to the Evening Journal.
He says that the studio audience includes close to the players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international patters in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes described in other countries in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such crowds, so-called professional audiences, who go to different programs, sormunen backgrounds.
He reminds us that following the game in itself is not so difficult to understand even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling off the wall.
For foreign speakers, however, there are interpreters in the studio who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap they throw there, for example, and what's going on," Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was recently supplied in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the shoots of Talent Finland in Finland.
He always had simultaneous interpretation in his ear, and he knew everything that was said in the illustrations in Finnish, the sum of the Sormunen.
South Japan's sullen typhoon is moving towards the main islands - the authorities warn against landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against potential landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuuni Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and that there is currently no information on fatalities.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK public radio company, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut off from over 300 000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in some places at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
Tokyo, the capital, is not directly on the path of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
♪ The sky of squawks became even darker ♪
It's been a bad start.
The sky became almost black as the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Pori now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points in total for the six rounds.
No Ässie defenseman or two lower chain players have scored yet.
Pressures are growing all the time.
As far as Sport was concerned, almost half of the game was gone.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried because that's what we didn't play very well.
In particular, the second round performance was shamefully poor, Jarno Karki told Ässi that 1+2 was effective.
Sport naturally enjoyed winning.
The team had a game under Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of bread-day visitors continued to increase
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of the bread day, wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe this year there wouldn't be so many people coming, Hyvärinen will think about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the SM competitions for Tractors were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of audiences might even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it did not; the corridors were already blocked briskly before 10, the sellers reported that the products had run out, the news porridge was sold more than before, and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000," Hyvärinen says later this afternoon.
In the five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a special amount of program for families with children, which may have attracted them to a record lot.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach a further distance.
Salesmen also turn to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year almost a hundred rapporteurs, handicrafts, pastry and harvest sellers had arrived at the bread holder.
The mother of the bread day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
The harvest was blessed at the beginning of the bread day.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won an audience vote.
Eleven different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäinen, winner of the rye bread competition, spent the day at the Martos Pie Shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book with your eyes tired.
It's worth a shot at a good light.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do Your Eyes a Ministry
The more years behind, the greater the importance of lighting.
Adequate light can help with problems that many face with age, as visual acuity decreases and dazzle becomes more and more.
The need for light also grows older.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore advisable to invest in the effects and characteristics of light for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create Beauty Around You
Only the right lighting solutions can be used to bring out the beautiful interior.
This moment's decorator can afford to choose.
There is a popular japandi style that combines non-violence, Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style with strong colors, different shades of metal or ice cream colors has also been inspired by the 1970s.
Trueness is fascinated by the same way as other home furnishings.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more investment is being made in the home now than before, and interior decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a tailor-made, bold luminaire to tell their story.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious," says Jokiniemi.
The home is not necessarily the latest trend light, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewelryy and elegant classics hold their ground year after year," says Jokiniemi.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
Kokokoon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are falling apart.
The Canadian attacker played three League games in orange black without power points," KooKoo says in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with an annual agreement, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in the KHL in Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no news of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
The Special Movement of Games The Game Man today recycles not only the games but also the packaging materials.
The products of Kivifootkauppa customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered online are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All the packages that come for us go for re-use.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Game Man.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also meant to move into recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not a source of additional effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is re-used.
Recycling is natural for Pelismies to operate, as in addition to new products, the core product range of the store includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion-conscious person: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in costume.
With their versatility, they create the foundation of a good garderob, as it is easy to assemble different costumes around high quality classics at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knits.
This category also includes the black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material on turtlenecks cannot be an error.
The clothing can be combined with straight pants, tuxedo and jeans, and you can create both a relaxed outfit and a snotty style around it.
Poolone is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from gold brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, black turtleneck and grey ankles.
The classic polo needle together with the other classics, the blue-green scone skirt and the wine-red Loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black turtleneck by combining it with casual clothes — jeans, high boots and thick tights.
Young and classy!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialise in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence team.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service in the Western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites," says the archive manager Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004) who defected west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups a Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established checkpoints from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
The agents of the Cold War hid supplies of mines, explosives, detonators and communication equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
In 1998, a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, with a trap mine exploded when it was sprayed by the authorities with a water cannon.
The police reached four drunk drivers in the county last night.
The police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1,57 per mil.
He drove around 4:30 a.m. at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
A 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1,54 per mil according to the police.
There were no serious injuries during the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old man from out-of-town drove a passenger car to an alkometer at 1.33 per mil.
The police suspect these male drivers of aggravated drunken driving and also the driver of Lake Polvi for endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of the Ollölättie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man who carried a local van blew 0.52 per mil.

HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probation period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director at Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (Kesk.) has been important for the team in the start-ups, under-power play and the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underpowering and in the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still some improvement, it is good for the young team to hold onto such experienced players, says Mika Toivola, sports director at HPK.
According to the hope, the value of Riska will rise when playing hockey league solution games.
Riska from Pietarsaari has played league hockey before in JYP, Luko and Sport.
On the other hand, Oskari Lehtinen, the attacker, was left without a contract after the probationary period.
The true story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's film is based on them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's guidance for 2015 is about a survival battle that has been handled to a large extent.
They've made movies of tragedy... and documents... before.
True events are also being reviewed in this case.
Twenty - two years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery performed before going to Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost sight, which meant that the conquest of the top had to be missed.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Yet, like a miracle, he could still get back on his feet and find the others.
The badly frozen Weathers were still thought to be dying, and once again he was left for his own good.
The obvious thing is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point even the co - climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old Eno Church
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and to celebrate the centenary, the whole family's festival was prepared for Sunday.
The festival started at the Eno church hill at 10 o'clock at the family fair, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at the Eno parish hall.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family Mass.
Uncle's pastor Armi Iravuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to the work," says Mount Iron (in the picture).
Many people have been touched by the fire of the church at risk of excitement, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno's church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran parishes following the destruction of the Church of Tragedyfell in a fire.
The Wooden Church of Tragedyfell was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held at the danger of excitement, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
On Saturday, a powerful hurricane - type autumn storm burst from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclads and Crete.
The images taken from the area show a lot of floods all over Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows that between houses in the city of Kiato, Corinthia, has suddenly appeared instead of the street because of the floods of the river.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused intense seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings heavy rains and even a flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medicans occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer, too, areas destroyed by terrain fires will be hit by the storm around Athens.
In Greece, the medic also raged last November.
We must not go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
The trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, be careful not to fly branches or other bulk in a storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by guides to a good 3,500 Finns who spend weekends on Sunday trips in Greece.
Instructions will be needed, as even storm Zorbas has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
In the vicinity of Crete, for example, wind speed can rise in gusts up to 45 meters per second.
The harsh rains add to the misery of the weather.
According to tour operators, all those travelling to Greece via Sun Trips and Tui who have communicated their telephone number have been warned about harsh winds by SMS.
In the air, however, sun and warmth
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, by the beginning of Saturday evening the resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and have risen according to normal schedule.
Of course we're watching the situation all the time.
Safety ahead.
I supported media caller Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our personnel on the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
The aid currently has more than 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodos had even spotted the sun and the temperature went to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C]," says Ikonen of Solar Trips.
Zorbas has been estimated to be the next nuisance of Turkey, albeit with some relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked the number of Finns who flew to Antalya Tuilla for example," says Schroderus.
Shirley Karvinen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening suits at the Missi Final - this is how they react to the situation.
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
The Huss says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a really great dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress was also chosen by the host Shirley Karvinen.
The two also noticed their uniforms and looked at the situation with laughter.
Garfield told Ilta-Sanom he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
The Hussi is a backstage and red carpet driver at the Missifinal, and he's talking to the front-row stars coming in.
Huss has recently moved to Jätkäsaari on Friday.
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office," Hussi wondered.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was just in the hotel for a week and didn't go anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful," says Hussi.
Shirley Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - collected the curious looks of pensioners
The host and Miss Finland Shirley Karvinen of 2016 told Miss Suomi final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Finland.
There has been enough urgency to ensure that Garfield arrived at the finals directly from Finnair.
I made up my makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is glamour.
A change of evening at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled his makeup out among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for the rest of us.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says that she enjoyed her job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Garfield says he's been visiting the singles on Friday.
It's kind of brutal in some way.
They're people's real feelings, Garfield describes the singles' feelings of the show.
How am I supposed to wear over knee boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that operates from season to season in costumes.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes there is room for more modern individuals.
A few years ago, overpile boots, which became hit shoes during the autumn and winter season, have not gone anywhere.
In line with their name, the boots over the knee repeat in style from year to year and from season to season.
The impressive boots share the views of the users, but it is worth trying out a bold model, well - courageously.
You see, the boots on the upper knee actually fit into any outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, tully or trico, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of your boots works.
The long boots look good in the party dress as well as in everyday clothes.
Black over knee boots are good for delicate outfits.
Fittingly, they balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plier skirt and a tender, smoky sweater.
A fresh but autumnly stylish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from a long copper brown velvety, over knee boots, spectacular earrings, and a staple bag.
Although the over knee boots have a certain subtlety, they also fit perfectly into a relaxed everyday dress along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
The Otaniemi robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robot cars are coping with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, traffic manager.
For the first time robot cars run completely automatically in other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether there is a free passage.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake has been detected, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4 in charge of the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, Wednesdays from 10 to 15 and Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
You can tell by the stop signs of the robot cars.
The bus is most secure at Otakaari stop number 1.
The bass player of the band Mokoma fell off stage in the middle of a job and was injured.
On their Facebook pages, the Mokoma group will announce an unexpected situation at the Tampere Packroom concert.
The show at the Tampere Packroom took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the night.
A hazy guy broke his wrist.
The band will inform you on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Last night, Santtu tripped in the Packroom from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done with a backup, the pages will read.
The fans of Mokoma respond with concern to a photo update where bassist Santtu lies with a cast in his hand on the bed.
This is the news we've been waiting for. It was a bit of a worry about how bad it got.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones heal over time.
Let's play along and make a quick recovery for Santu and have a good tour for the rest of the band plus the replacement!
And thank you for last night, it was a great gig, but promise you'll leave out such a strong drama for the rest of the gigs?
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, the Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's crowd members reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and legitimacy of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the permissible quantities of self-charged weapons used in the chicken fortification were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily base payments for trespassing.
In addition, the police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of being drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the form of fines, police times.
To sum up, hunters do very well to comply with the authorisation of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The silent goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
In the next few days, Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees have been decided to leave Turkish refugee camps in Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year and include representatives of the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already doing interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
He will also meet with non-governmental organisations on the Syrian border, Süleyman Soylu, the Turkish Minister for the Interior.
In addition, Ilkka Salmi, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of the Interior, is involved.
Talk of raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement within the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
During this term of office, the silent visit will be the first one made by the Minister for the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Affairs Ministers Petteri Orpo (Co.) and Paula Risikko (Co.) were able to move on to their new tasks before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going to get on the wrong foot. You don't know if you're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
The Karelian reported last Saturday on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals which are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees in respect of production animals, pets or other business activities.
Consequently, all other animals are prohibited in principle except those specifically mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, I think it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security or good practice of society.
In principle, a ban is now being imposed on any activity which is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business or do anything else until the law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
The government's work in law-making in general has been weak.
If we now take the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that animal welfare law will require an update.
But a project of this kind is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a procedure as 'Everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will stop such a legal project.
Metti Forssell Tips: The four trendiest skirts in autumn

Turkey is advised to download mobile phones in case of a storm
The storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists especially warned the sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday early evening, disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure internet access so that people can get up-to-date updates," says Anadolu Ajansi, a local news agency.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to rain heavy and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, the red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service gave a red weather warning to the regions of southern Greece, Attika, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclads and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow the weather reports and the instructions of local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and it rained.
People were calm, communication manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui Travel Agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in need.
In Greece, many ports had no ships on Saturday, reports Amna, a local news agency.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told about travel agencies to STT.

Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation was being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the cause of Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
The Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard on Russian gp time.
However, there is no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best for the weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven, and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen clearly said.
Ferrari was already having a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
The rapper was asked what caused the sudden fall from Mercedes' ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are - that's how simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, we saw a rare treat for Sauber in Räikkönen's future stable.
Next season, Charles Leclerc, replacing the Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time-time session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place to leave is best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early days, it's been a big step forward.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart's evening was steady.
The German was a more protagonist in the ring, but he didn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius, who is more far-reaching, controls the fight with his tough sets that found their way.
The Finnishman was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left.
The hit was so hard that the old man in front of the home crowd did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was secured, Helenius was quite moderate.
At the beginning of the ring interview, he praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish cheers.
We brought a belt today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get into the World Cup," Helenius commented to the Evening Magazine before the match.
On the other hand, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it crossed my mind.
It's not getting any younger here, but Helenius, 34 years old, admitted before he met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster can multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country is calling for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can reach thousands.
Difficult circumstances
The rescuers are looking for the trapped and also the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port of Palu and its neighboring town Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Pratas, and the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers report hearing screams from people trapped in ruins, but the lack of grubbing - up equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
The Indonesian president, Joso Widodo, has ordered an army to rescue and clear up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications in the disaster area are cut off in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running low.
Miss Finland's hesitant response and long reflection caused laughter
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Ruukki, Billnäs.
In the interview round, every Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists drew the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, hesitated to answer in the audience that was present produced sweet but benevolent laughs.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was read by a Miss Finalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before he began with hesitation.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
A pause for reflection in the audience made a laugh, until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is the economics of someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a round of applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm gives up the crown.
Sike's apple pear cake takes his tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from behind, because a domestic apple is shockingly expensive in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake also has its pear.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed homes.
Slicing.
Melt the butter in a pot.
Shake the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour and the butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch, i.e. maizena, baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180°C for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then cancel the tray.
Cut the cake when it's cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and cracks easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
The International Criminal Literature Event will be held in Ruka in January
Kuusamo Ruka will host for the first time an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature in January.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary program numbers as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish literature and Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, the Swedish duo behind the writer's name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also show visitors from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" of slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and, in that respect, the opposite dissident coolness.
According to researchers' description, attractively cool people had many features that were considered socially desirable: outwardly oriented, friendly, harmonious, and qualified.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and agility.
They thirsted for experience and cared little for the outsider's judgements.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of tough isn't long-term cool: high status in teens doesn't necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what a study published in the magazine Child Development in the United States in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, reaching out to good - looking people and seeking favor with others had an increased risk of drug abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they did in the past with their most inconspicuous peers.
High status relaying snowmobiles, designer bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most people were more prepared to make friends with people dressed in a regular supermarket shirt than in a brandy shirt, despite the fact that most people chose to wear a designer shirt when they were introduced.
If you're in the Greek holiday islands, be careful!
There's a hurricane about to strike. The weather warning is screaming red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland over the average of six months.
The Zorbas horrid storm will strike Greece over the weekend.
Prepare yourself if you are staying in the territory of Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclads or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook site.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported in the weather service Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's hardest bursts are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm, which hit Finland at the beginning of the week, blew at its hardest at just over 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
During the weekend in southern Greece, over 300 mm of water may arrive.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize a man drooling Love Island Finland - Anku?
Appears in perplexing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku, which has been drooled by several men, also performs as a craftswoman with strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to manufacture an octopus from an old paper roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how tights can be worked out by a hedgehog that grows proper spikes.
Now let's make Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a slightly surprising way, Anku insinuates and displays sawdust, tights, and grass seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch videos from below or from Ankun Youtube here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi, is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more than dozens of minutes after his Russian gp pole drive while he was in front of the media.
The great tour left behind Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important criticism of the Finnish driver this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round.
Feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good to me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
Sochi's track is not easy to bypass, so departure is a particularly big part.
And of course, Bottas had to answer questions about whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's going to be in front of Hamilton, who is approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the stake, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and the difference between me is very big, so I'll keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after the race, and the boss of Mercedes Toto Wolff had a taste too.
Lewis had a plan to beat Valtteri, but he didn't make it through the seven fight.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged up, the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
To the question of whether the stables allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive straight, Wolff answered with evasiveness.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitelainen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of racing was rarely completed.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
It was now done by Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen, who was a member of the Finnish Championship, secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him with the Finnish Championship of two-wheel cars from the SM4 class.
Vinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started the Turku competition with restraint because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to compensate when some of the extra lights failed with another special test.
It allowed me to go blind with a third piece.
You know, in a situation like that, you don't have to go down the drain.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed," Kinnunen explained.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Secretary of State Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Mr Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and he said that the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to seven years of war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germany that a meeting was planned for October in Syria with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judge drama on TV.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of molesting the Supreme Court, received an extraordinary number of people at the squares.
In the United States, at least 20 million people received at least a full - power appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge on Thursday.
At that time, Mr Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and the California Professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, were followed by a total of 20,4 million viewers.
In addition to them, online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6,8 million people followed the live stream and CNN reported a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts of the year.
CNN will increase by more than 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are the channels' own, TV viewers' figures are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will in any case be staggering.
Few reach 20 million.
In the United States, more than 20 million spectators usually only get sporting matches and the great Oscar and Grammy galas of the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, it's a long way to go to the US's most watched annual show, the American Football League's NFL final game at the Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered some 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Mr Trump's first speech to Congress, according to Mr Nielsen, was attended by nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million inaugurals.
It's a top priority.
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge in the United States is an extremely important case, since the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on many questions he was the so-called language of the scales, whose voice could determine the position of a court of nine.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he decided that the same sex was granted marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than he is.
His choice to the Supreme Court may lock up the court for decades of conservative superiority.
Children have the right to be informed by parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents did not even get to look at the health records or prescriptions of infants.
In autumn 2016, a temporary correction was made for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to correct.
Now the repair is due - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a win-win case.
Then, with the layman's understanding, it's about the push of a button: now that the wire is closed, it's opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
ID is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank credentials.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a primary school fourth grader except by asking for it printed out.
It is not so much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is of the utmost importance for the child's care that parents can be involved.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations in which not all things can be talked about freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the Feds started to clean up harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media, the FBI investigates allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate's Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
President Donald Trump of the United States ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation of criminal investigations and may not become public.
He threatened to kill cops at a police station in Kajaani.
The caught brawler continued to pull around the station.
The police say they put a man in a police penitentiary for "stabilize."
The police were threatened by a suspect abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities report an incident that began when a man of over 30 years was violently challenged in a downtown restaurant.
First, he assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This led to the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to get in the way, he hit him too.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police will tell you.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "soothe."
He's a suspect in three assaults and violent assaults against an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawes - "Clean Water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia," says Kirsi Haru, Information Manager at the Finnish UNICEF.
The local authorities are in charge of the rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness," says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue operations are under way, but in the Donggala region, the situation is a little more unclear.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off," says Haru.
In Sulawes, buildings are often light - constructioned, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing most people can do is offer water cleaning tablets, which UNICEF also has in store.
Efforts will be made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water will be transported first by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and the reunification of families is one part of Unicef's mission.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP) which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously raised for emergency aid will be used.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started to raise funds to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors, puts an end to the $20 million fine for tweets.
Elon Musk, the founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges through an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will cease his duties as chairman of Tesla's board of directors and agree to a fine of $20 million.
Musk resigns as part of the contract he entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing to Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The SEC threatened Muski for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla, an electric car company, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair the Tesla Board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its Board of Directors and include two "independent leaders" in its Management Team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk still gets to be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski's personal $20 million fines, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding $20 million fines to the financial controller.
Tweets Misdirected Investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the funding to buy back Tesla as a private limited liability company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at a price of $420.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent per day, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the overseer, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with the other management group or the board of directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 per cent when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
It is expected that the company's course will be re-enhanced in order to agree on the news.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt heard an exorcism and the organ would sound to itself.
This, of course, is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected," says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account states that the last sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me that church bells don't ring because of the malfunction.
